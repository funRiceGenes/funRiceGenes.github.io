* **Key message**  
    + The brd2 locus contains a single base deletion in the coding region of Dim/dwf1, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana DIMINUTO/DWARF1 (DIM/DWF1)
    + Overproduction and repression of Dim/dwf1 resulted in contrasting phenotypes, with repressors mimicking the brd2 phenotype and overproducers having large stature with increased numbers of flowers and seeds
    + The Rice brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf2 mutant, defective in the rice homolog of Arabidopsis DIMINUTO/DWARF1, is rescued by the endogenously accumulated alternative bioactive brassinosteroid, dolichosterone
    + Based on these observations, we discuss an alternative BR biosynthetic pathway that produces DS when Dim/dwf1 is defective
    + LHDD10 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, but more so in shoot apices and panicles
    + We isolated lhdd10 by map-based cloning; it encoded a putative FAD-linked oxidoreductase protein (a brassinosteroid biosynthetic gene) that localized to the nucleus
    + In this study, we characterized a late heading, dwarf mutant known as lhdd10 selected following ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treatment of ssp
    + Brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic gene lhdd10 controls late heading and plant height in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Our data showed that lhdd10 influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions
    + The ltbsg1 seedlings had a lower endogenous BR level and could be restored to the phenotype of wild type by exogenous BR
    + This study demonstrated that LTBSG1 could play a new role in regulating panicle and grain development by BR biosynthetic pathway
    + In the present study, a mutant named ltbsg1 (longer top branch and shorter grain 1) was isolated from the cultivar &amp;ldquo;Zhenong 34&amp;rdquo; (Oryza sativa L
    + The histocytological analysis indicated that the elongated top branch and shorter grain of mutant ltbsg1 were caused from the defects of cell elongation
    + The LTBSG1 knock-out lines showed similar phenotype defects as mutant ltbsg1, which confirmed that LTBSG1 was responsible for top branch elongation and grain size reduction
    + LTBSG1 was constitutively expressed and the protein was widely localized in chloroplast, nucleus and cytomembrane
    + The ltbsg1 gene in mutant revealed a single nucleotide substitution (G-A) in the exon 2 of LOC_Os10g25780, causing an amino acid variation (Glycine-Arginine) in the FAD (Flavin-adenine dinucleotide)-binding domain of delta (24)-sterol reductase, which was involved in the brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis
    + In summary, the current study has identified a new BRD2 allele, which facilitated the further research on the molecular mechanism of this gene on regulating growth and development
    + Natural variation of the BRD2 allele affects plant height and grain size in rice.
    + The zqdm1 identified from a rice mutant is a novel allele of BRD2 and is responsible for regulating rice plant height, grain size and appearance, which has possibilities on improving rice quality
    + Complementation tests have confirmed that 369-bp insertion in BRD2 was responsible for the plant height and grain size changing in the zqdm1 mutant
    + Over-expression of BRD2 driven by different promoters into indica rice variety Jiafuzhan (JFZ) results in slender grains, suggesting its function on regulating grain shape
