* **Information**  
    + Symbol: Bph32

* **Publication**  
    + [Bph32, a novel gene encoding an unknown SCR domain-containing protein, confers resistance against the brown planthopper in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Bph32, a novel gene encoding an unknown SCR domain-containing protein, confers resistance against the brown planthopper in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2016, Sci Rep.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Expression analysis revealed that Bph32 was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where BPH primarily settles and feeds, at 2 and 24<U+2009>h after BPH infestation, suggesting that Bph32 may inhibit feeding in BPH
    + The transgenic introgression of Bph32 into a susceptible rice variety significantly improved resistance to BPH
