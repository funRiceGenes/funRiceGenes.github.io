* **Key message**  
    + Together, these results suggest that BSR-K1 functions in the cytoplasm.
    + We conclude that the bsr-k1 mutant clearly confers broad-spectrum disease resistance.
    + Thus, BSR-K1 regulates plant immunity through a mechanism different from those of previously identified RNA-binding proteins
