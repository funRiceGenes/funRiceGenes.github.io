* **Key message**  
    + When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity
    + In addition, the suppression of the function of OsASGR-BBML1 and its homologues in zygotes resulted in the developmental arrest, suggesting that OsASGR-BBML1 possesses an important role in initiating zygotic development
    + Interestingly, ectopic expression of OsASGR-BBML1 in egg cells induced nuclear and cell divisions, indicating that exogenously expressed OsASGR-BBML1 converts the proliferation status of the egg cell from quiescent to active
    + We identify OsYUCCA (OsYUC) auxin biosynthesis genes as direct targets of OsBBM1
    + In somatic embryogenesis, exogenous auxin triggers OsBBM1 expression, which then activates endogenous auxin biosynthesis OsYUC genes
    + We used gene editing, transcriptome profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the molecular players involved in embryo initiation downstream of OsBBM1
    + Zygotic embryo initiation involves a partnership of male and female genomes, through which paternal OsBBM1 activates maternal OsYUC genes
    + Ectopic OsBBM1 initiates somatic embryogenesis without exogenous auxins but requires functional OsYUC genes
