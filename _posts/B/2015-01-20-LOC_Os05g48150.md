* **Key message**  
    + Together, these results suggest that B'κ-PP2A dephosphorylates SIT1 in planta under normal conditions and at the onset of salt exposure to maintain SIT1 phosphorylation at a low level, which consequently suppresses plant salt sensitivity.
    + In this way, SIT1 activity is decreased to a low level by salt, and MAPK signaling is limited to benefit plant growth. An increase in B'<a6><ca>-PP2A holoenzyme may target other substrates to positively regulate salt tolerance.
