* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, BC12/GDD1, a kinesin-like protein with transcription regulation activity, mediates cell elongation by regulating the GA biosynthesis pathway in rice
    + Mutation of rice BC12/GDD1, which encodes a kinesin-like protein that binds to a GA biosynthesis gene promoter, leads to dwarfism with impaired cell elongation
    + Mitotic microtubule array comparison, flow cytometric analysis and expression assays of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in root-tip cells showed that cell-cycle progression is affected in bc12 mutants
    + GDD1 was cloned by a map-based approach, was expressed constitutively, and was found to encode the kinesin-like protein BRITTLE CULM12 (BC12)
    + bc12 mutants display dwarfism resulting from a significant reduction in cell number and brittleness due to an alteration in cellulose microfibril orientation and wall composition
    + Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm12 (BC12), a gene encoding a kinesin-4 protein
    + BC12 is expressed mainly in tissues undergoing cell division and secondary wall thickening
    + Therefore, BC12 functions as a dual-targeting kinesin protein and is implicated in cell-cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and wall composition in the monocot plant rice
    + In this study we reveal that the novel BC12328Leu allele of BC12 modulated plant leaf color in yd1 plants, which has not been previously reported in studies of BC12/GDD1/MTD1/SRG1
    + We conclude that LGW regulates grain development by directly binding to the GW7 promoter and activating its expression
    + Overexpression of LGW increased the grain length, indicating that LGW is a positive regulator for regulating grain length
    + Elevating the GW7 expression levels in lgw plants rescued the small grain size phenotype
    + Our findings revealed that LGW plays an important role in regulating grain size, and manipulation of this gene provides a new strategy for regulating grain weight in rice
    + Protein sequence alignment analysis revealed that the mutation site was located at the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of LGW/BC12, resulting in the lgw protein not being located in the nucleus
