* **Key message**  
    + Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of BSR1 was critical for proper localization of BSR1 in rice cells and played a crucial role in BSR1-mediated resistance to multiple diseases, as evidenced by compromised disease resistance in transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant BSR1 in which Tyr-63 was substituted with Ala
    + Overall, our data indicate that BSR1 is a nonreceptor dual-specificity kinase and that both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are critical for the normal functioning of BSR1 in the resistance to multiple pathogens
    + In the present study, we report that BSR1 is a functional protein kinase that autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates an artificial substrate, in vitro
    + Although BSR1 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase, it was shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine/threonine residues when expressed in bacteria, demonstrating that it is a dual-specificity kinase
    + Here we analyzed immune responses using rice suspension-cultured cells and sliced leaf blades overexpressing BSR1
    + BSR1 overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips
    + Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance Conferred by the Overexpression of Rice RLCK BSR1 Results from an Enhanced Immune Response to Multiple MAMPs.
    + Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that BSR1 overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens
    + However, it remains unclear how overexpressed BSR1 reinforces plant immunity
    + BSR1 was also involved in the immune responses triggered by peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide
    + Overexpression of BSR1 confers strong resistance against fungal and bacterial pathogens
    + In the background of BSR1 overaccumulation, the knockout of OsCERK1 nearly abolished the enhancement of blast resistance
    + Our recent study revealed that MAMP-triggered immune responses are mediated by BSR1 in wild-type rice and are hyperactivated in BSR1-overexpressing rice
