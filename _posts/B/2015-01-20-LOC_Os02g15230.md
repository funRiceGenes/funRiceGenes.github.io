* **Key message**  
    + Cell wall composition, detailed xylan structure characterization and enzyme kinetics and activity assays on acetylated sugars and xylooligosaccharides demonstrate that BS1 is an esterase that cleaves acetyl moieties from the xylan backbone at O-2 and O-3 positions of xylopyranosyl residues
    + This study suggests that the dr gene is involved in the regulation of silica deposition and that disruption of silica processes lead to drooping leaf phenotypes
    + Compared with the wild type, dr plants exhibited drooping leaves accompanied by a small midrib, short panicle, and reduced plant height
