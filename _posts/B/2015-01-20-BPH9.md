* **Key message**  
    + BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH
    + BPH9 encodes a rare type of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein that localizes to the endomembrane system and causes a cell death phenotype
    + The resulting Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 had stronger antixenotic and antibiosis effects on BPH and exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to BPH than near isogenic lines NIL-Bph6 and NIL-Bph9
    + LuoYang69 derived hybrids, harboring heterozygous Bph6 and Bph9 genes, also conferred high level of resistance to BPH
    + The development of Bph6 and Bph9 pyramided line LuoYang69 provides valuable resource to develop hybrid rice with highly and durable BPH resistance
    + The identified Bph9 containing cultivars can be used as new sources for BPH resistance breeding programs
    + Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.
    + The development of functional markers will promote MAS of Bph9
