__OverExpression__: Rice BADH1 OsBADH1 has been shown to be targeted to peroxisome and its overexpression resulted in increased GB biosynthesis and tolerance to abiotic stress  
__RNAi__:RNAi-directed downregulation of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 OsBADH1 results in decreased stress tolerance and increased oxidative markers without affecting glycine betaine biosynthesis in rice Oryza sativa. |  In this study, we demonstrated a pivotal role of OsBADH1 in stress tolerance without altering GB biosynthesis capacity, using the RNA interference RNAi technique |  The decrease of stress tolerance occurring in the OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines was associated with an elevated level of malondialdehyde content and hydrogen peroxidation |  Moreover, transgenic OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines showed significantly reduced seed set and yield
