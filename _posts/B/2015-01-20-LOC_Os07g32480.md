* **Key message**  
    + Although the homologs can faithfully separate from each other at the end of meiosis I, the uncorrected merotelic attachment of paired sister kinetochores at the early stage of metaphase I in brk1 reduces the tension across homologous kinetochores, causes the metaphase I spindle to be aberrantly shaped, and subsequently affects the synchronicity of homolog separation at the onset of anaphase I
    + BRK1, a Bub1-related kinase, is essential for generating proper tension between homologous kinetochores at metaphase I of rice meiosis
    + The brk1 mutants are sterile due to the precocious separation of sister chromatids at the onset of anaphase I
