* **Key message**  
    + Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
    + Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response
    + Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice
    + Bph14 is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles, the site of BPH feeding
    + In this study, we cloned Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to BPH at seedling and maturity stages of the rice plant, using a map-base cloning approach
    + Additionally, the resistance domains and FL BPH14 protein formed homo-complexes that interacted with transcription factors WRKY46 and WRKY72
    + Here, we analyzed the functions of the domains of BPH14 to identify molecular mechanisms underpinning BPH14-mediated planthopper resistance
    + The CC or NB domains alone or in combination (CC-NB [CN]) conferred a similar level of brown planthopper resistance to that of full-length (FL) BPH14
    + In this study,  Luoyou9348 (containing Bph14 and highly resistance to BPH) and Yangliangyou6 (without Bph14 and susceptible to BPH) were planted under varying nitrogen regimes (0 kg ha-1 , 90 kg ha-1 , 180 kg ha-1 ) to determine their effects on the resistance levels of the rice to BPH feeding
    + The control of the brown planthopper by the rice Bph14 gene is affected by nitrogen.
