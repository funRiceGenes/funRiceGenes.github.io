* **Key message**  
    + Monosaccharide analysis of total and fractioned wall residues revealed that bc10 showed impaired cellulose biosynthesis
    + BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties
    + We report here the isolation and in-depth characterization of a brittle rice mutant, brittle culm 10 (bc10)
    + bc10 plants show pleiotropic phenotypes, including brittleness of the plant body and retarded growth
