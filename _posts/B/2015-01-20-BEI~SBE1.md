* **Key message**  
    + Rice starch branching enzyme 1 (SBE1) and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) catalyzed the biosynthesis of amylopectin and amylose in rice developing endosperm respectively, and the genes encoding these two enzymes, sbe1 and waxy, are mainly expressed in the endosperm
    + The cDNA of two SBE(starch-branching enzyme) genes Sbe1 and Sbe3 encoding SBE I and SBE III (two major isoforms in rice) were cloned by an improved RT-PCR technique, from a template cDNA library derived from the total mRNAs extracted from the immature seeds of a japonica rice Wuyunjing 7
    + The cloned Sbe1 and Sbe3 cDNAs make it possible to improve rice starch quality through genetic engineering
    + We determined the crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in complex with maltopentaose at a resolution of 2
    + Crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in complex with maltopentaose
    + We overproduced rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in Escherichia coli cells, and the resulting enzyme (rBEI) was characterized with respect to biochemical and crystallographic properties
    + Biochemical and Crystallographic Characterization of the Starch Branching Enzyme I (BEI) fromOryza sativaL
    + The rice branching enzyme I (BEI) overproduced in Escherichia coli cells was investigated with respect to action on starches
    + The Action of Rice Branching Enzyme I (BEI) on Starches
    + Within the 5'-upstream region of rice sbe1 gene, we identified a 53 bp fragment C53 which could interact with the nuclear proteins extracted from rice endosperm
    + These results suggested that the expression of sbe1 and waxy gene in rice developing endosperm may be coordinately regulated by REB-like bZIP transcriptional factors
    + Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression
    + BEI treatment decreased the turbidity of starch suspensions with distinct pasting behaviors from a native starch
