* **Key message**  
    + When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity
    + In addition, the suppression of the function of OsASGR-BBML1 and its homologues in zygotes resulted in the developmental arrest, suggesting that OsASGR-BBML1 possesses an important role in initiating zygotic development
    + Interestingly, ectopic expression of OsASGR-BBML1 in egg cells induced nuclear and cell divisions, indicating that exogenously expressed OsASGR-BBML1 converts the proliferation status of the egg cell from quiescent to active
