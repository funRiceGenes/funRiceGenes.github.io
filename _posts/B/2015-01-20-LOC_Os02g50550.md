* **Key message**  
    + Mutation of OsDRP2B disturbs the membrane trafficking that is essential for normal cellulose biosynthesis of the secondary cell wall, thereby leading to inferior mechanical properties in rice plants
    + The bc3 mutation resulted in reductions of 28-36% in cellulose contents in culms, leaves, and roots, while other cell wall components remained unaffected
    + From promoter-GUS analyses, it was suggested that BC3 expression is directly correlated with active secondary cell wall synthesis
    + These results suggest that BC3 is tightly involved in the synthesis of cellulose and is essential for proper secondary cell wall construction
    + Rice BRITTLE CULM 3 (BC3) encodes a classical dynamin OsDRP2B essential for proper secondary cell wall synthesis
    + Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm3 (BC3), a gene encoding OsDRP2B
    + Consistent with the expression of BC3 in mechanical tissues, the bc3 mutation reduces mechanical strength, which results from decreased cellulose content and altered secondary wall structure
    + BC3 mutation and overexpression altered the abundance of cellulose synthase catalytic subunit 4 (OsCESA4) in the PM and in the endomembrane systems
    + Through positional cloning, we have identified a gene responsible for the brittle culm phenotype in rice, brittle culm 3 (bc3)
