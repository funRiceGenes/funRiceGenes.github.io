* **Key message**  
    + The brd2 locus contains a single base deletion in the coding region of Dim/dwf1, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana DIMINUTO/DWARF1 (DIM/DWF1)
    + Overproduction and repression of Dim/dwf1 resulted in contrasting phenotypes, with repressors mimicking the brd2 phenotype and overproducers having large stature with increased numbers of flowers and seeds
    + The Rice brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf2 mutant, defective in the rice homolog of Arabidopsis DIMINUTO/DWARF1, is rescued by the endogenously accumulated alternative bioactive brassinosteroid, dolichosterone
    + Based on these observations, we discuss an alternative BR biosynthetic pathway that produces DS when Dim/dwf1 is defective
    + LHDD10 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, but more so in shoot apices and panicles
    + We isolated lhdd10 by map-based cloning; it encoded a putative FAD-linked oxidoreductase protein (a brassinosteroid biosynthetic gene) that localized to the nucleus
    + In this study, we characterized a late heading, dwarf mutant known as lhdd10 selected following ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treatment of ssp
    + Brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic gene lhdd10 controls late heading and plant height in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Our data showed that lhdd10 influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions
