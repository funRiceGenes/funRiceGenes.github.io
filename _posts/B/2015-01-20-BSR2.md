* **Key message**  
    + The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.
    + Both Arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing BSR2 had slower growth and produced longer seeds than wild-type control plants
    + These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis
    + When overexpressed in rice, BSR2 also conferred resistance to two R
