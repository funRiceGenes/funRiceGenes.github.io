* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism
    + Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
    + In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains
    + Moreover, BG1 is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport

* **Connection**  
    + __BG1__, __OsMADS34~PAP2__, [Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
    + __BG1__, __sh4~SHA1~SG5__, [Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Short grain 5 controls grain length in rice by regulating cell expansion.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, the expression levels of BG1, GS2, and DEP1 were reduced in sg5 plants, and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that SG5 can bind to the BG1 gene promoter
