* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism
    + Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
    + In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains
    + Moreover, BG1 is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport
