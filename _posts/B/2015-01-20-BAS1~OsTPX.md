* **Key message**  
    + Heterologous OsTPX expression increased the ability of the transgenic yeast cells to adapt and recover from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stresses, such as a reduction of cellular hydroperoxide levels in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and menadione, by improving redox homeostasis
    + These results suggest that heterologous OsTPX expression increases acquired tolerance to ROS-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves fermentation capacity due to improved cell survival during fermentation, especially at a high temperature
    + Furthermore, high OsTPX expression improved the fermentation capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a high temperature (40 degrees C) and at the general cultivation temperature (30 degrees C)
    + In this study, a putative chloroplastic 2-Cys thioredoxin peroxidase (OsTPX) was identified by proteome analysis from leaf tissue samples of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings exposed to 0
    + The alcohol yield in OsTPX-expressing transgenic yeast increased by approximately 29 % (0
