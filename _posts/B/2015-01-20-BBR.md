    + [The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3%5BTitle%5D), 2003, The Plant Journal.

    + [AAK52535](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AAK52535)

* **Key message**  
    + In co-transfection experiments, BBR activates (GA/TC)8-containing promoters, and its overexpression in tobacco leads to a pronounced leaf shape modification
    + The data presented suggest that expression of the barley BKn3 is regulated, at least in part, by the binding of the transcription factor BBR to GA/TC repeats
    + The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3
