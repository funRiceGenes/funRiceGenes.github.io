* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that a rice SWI/SNF2 ATPase gene BRHIS1 is downregulated in response to the rice blast fungal pathogen or to the defense-priming-inducing compound BIT (1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2h)-one,1, 1-dioxide)
    + Our results show that rice disease defense genes are initially organized in an expression-ready state by specific monoubiquitination of H2A and H2B variants deposited on their promoter regions, but are kept suppressed by the BRHIS1 complex, facilitating the prompt initiation of innate immune responses in response to infection through the stringent regulation of BRHIS1
    + BRHIS1 suppresses rice innate immunity through binding to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B variants.
