* **Key message**  
    + GRA78 encoding a putative S-sulfocysteine synthase is involved in chloroplast development at the early seedling stage of rice.
    + GRA78 is constitutively expressed in all tissues and its encoded protein is targeted to the chloroplast
    + Map-based cloning revealed that candidate gene LOC_Os01g59920 of GRA78 encodes a putative S-sulfocysteine synthase showing significant similarity with Arabidopsis CS26
