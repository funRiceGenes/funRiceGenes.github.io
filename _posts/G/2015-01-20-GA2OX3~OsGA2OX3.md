* **Key message**  
    + When excessive active BR is applied, the hormone mostly induces GA inactivation through upregulation of the GA inactivation gene GA2ox-3 and also represses BR biosynthesis, resulting in decreased hormone levels and growth inhibition.

    + __GA2OX3~OsGA2OX3__, __OsGA2ox1__, [OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D), Additional GA(1) and real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2 and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3

    + __GA2OX3~OsGA2OX3__, __OsMADS57__, [Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.%5BTitle%5D),  More importantly, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsMADS57 directly regulates the transcription of OsGA2ox3 as well as EUI1 through binding to the CArG-box motifs in their promoter regions
