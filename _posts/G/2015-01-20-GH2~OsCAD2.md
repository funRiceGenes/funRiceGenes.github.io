## Expression information

## Key message
1. __sheath__, [OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm%5BTitle%5D),  Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 pCAD::GUS in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin
2. __panicle__, [GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity
3. __root__, [OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm%5BTitle%5D),  Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 pCAD::GUS in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin
4. __root__, [GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity
5. __culm__, [OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm%5BTitle%5D), OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm
