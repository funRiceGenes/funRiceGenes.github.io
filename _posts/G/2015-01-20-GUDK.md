* **Key message**  
    + The gudk mutants interestingly showed a significant reduction in grain yield, both under normal well-watered conditions and under drought stress at the reproductive stage
    + Loss-of-function gudk mutant lines exhibit sensitivity to salinity, osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment at the seedling stage, and a reduction in photosynthesis and plant biomass under controlled drought stress at the vegetative stage
    + Phosphoproteome profiling of the mutant followed by in vitro assays identified the transcription factor APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR OsAP37 as a phosphorylation target of GUDK
    + We propose that GUDK mediates drought stress signaling through phosphorylation and activation of OsAP37, resulting in transcriptional activation of stress-regulated genes, which impart tolerance and improve yield under drought
    + Our transactivation assays confirmed that GUDK is required for activation of stress genes by OsAP37
    + GUDK is induced under several stresses and its loss-of-function increased the sensitivity of rice seedlings to salinity, osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment
    + In addition to reduced tolerance of gudk mutant plants to drought stress at vegetative stage, a significant reduction in grain yield was observed under well-watered and drought stress conditions at reproductive stage
    + Thus, our results suggest that GUDK has the potential to regulate grain yield both under favorable and unfavorable conditions
    + Gene co-expression analysis supports the role of GUDK in regulating important biological processes both under control and stress conditions
