* **Key message**  
    + We showed that GSE5 regulates grain size predominantly by influencing cell proliferation in spikelet hulls
    + Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.
    + Taken together, our results indicate that the previously unrecognized GSE5 gene in the qSW5/GW5 locus that is widely utilized by rice breeders controls grain size and reveal that natural variation in the promoter region of GSE5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice
    + Further analyses indicate that wild rice accessions contain all the three haplotypes of GSE5, suggesting that the GSE5 haplotypes present in cultivated rice are likely to have originated from different wild rice accessions during rice domestication
    + GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains (IQD), which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1

* **Connection**  
    + __GSE5__, __OsCam1-1__, [Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains (IQD), which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1
    + __GSE5__, __OsPUB3__, [Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice Oryza sativa L. by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice Oryza sativa L. by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.%5BTitle%5D),  Their differences on grain weight and size were significant in the background of non-functional gse5, but non-significant in the background of functional GSE5, indicating a genetic interaction between OsPUB3 and GSE5
