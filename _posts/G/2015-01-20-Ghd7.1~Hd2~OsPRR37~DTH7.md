* **Key message**  
    + Validation and characterization of Ghd7.1, a major quantitative trait locus with pleiotropic effects on spikelets per panicle, plant height, and heading date in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Natural variation in Ghd7.1 plays an important role in grain yield and adaptation in rice
    + Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions
    + Switching genetic effects of the flowering time gene Hd1 in LD conditions by Ghd7 and OsPRR37 in rice.
    + Genetic analyses, including segregation analyses, evaluations of near isogenic lines, and transformation for flowering time demonstrated that Hd1 promoted flowering time in inductive SD and non-inductive LD conditions in genetic condition of loss-of-function Ghd7 and OsPRR37 (ghd7osprr37) in rice
    + Functional Ghd7 or OsPRR37 may switch the genetic effects of Hd1 from the promotion to the delay of flowering times in LD conditions
    + Genetic Interactions Among Ghd7, Ghd8, OsPRR37 and Hd1 Contribute to Large Variation in Heading Date in Rice.
    + Genetic analysis indicated that the promotion of heading date and reduction in grain yield by OsPRR37 were partially dependent on Ghd7
    + Map-based cloning facilitated by the MutMap strategy revealed that LHD7 was on the same locus as OsPRR37 but exhibited a novel function as a promoter of heading date
    + OsPRR37 Alternatively Promotes Heading Date Through Suppressing the Expression of Ghd7 in the Japonica Variety Zhonghua 11 under Natural Long-Day Conditions
    + Our study revealed the distinct role of OsPRR37 in the ZH11 background, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of OsPRR37 function and enriches the theoretical bases for improvement of rice heading date in the future
