## Expression information

## Key message
1. __disease resistance__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene
2. __fertility__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
3. __disease__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene
4. __disease__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene
5. __blast disease__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene
6. __growth__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
7. __root__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
8. __blast__, [Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene
