* **Key message**  
    + To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene
    + Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
    + RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene
