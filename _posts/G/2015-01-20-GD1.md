* **Key message**  
    + In addition, expression of GD1 was induced under sugar treatment, and the contents of starch and soluble sugar are altered in the gd1 mutant
    + In addition to the severe germination defect, the gd1 mutant also shows a dwarf phenotype and abnormal flower development
    + These data indicate that GD1 participates directly or indirectly in regulating GA and carbohydrate homeostasis, and further regulates rice seed germination and seedling development
    + To understand seed development and seed germination in cereals, a large-scale screen was performed using our T-DNA mutant population, and a mutant germination-defective1 (gd1) was identified
    + Furthermore, GD1 binds to the promoter of OsLFL1, a LEC2/FUS3-like gene of rice, via an RY element, leading to significant up-regulation of OsLFL1 and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the gd1 mutant
    + Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
    + Exogenous application of GA not only induced GD1 expression, but also partially rescued the dwarf phenotype of gd1
    + Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that GD1 encodes a B3 domain-containing transcription factor with repression activity
