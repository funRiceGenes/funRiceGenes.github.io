    + CONCLUSION: GLR1 plays an important role in rice trichome development and will contribute to breeding of glabrous elite rice varieties
    + Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.
    + A loss-of-function mutant of LSY1 exhibited an asymmetrical defect from early leaf development, which is different from a symmetric defect in a double loss-of-function mutant of NAL2/3, whereas the expression of both genes was observed in a similar domain in the margins of leaf primordia
    + Expression domains and the level of adaxial/abaxial marker genes were affected in the LSY1 overexpressing plants, indicating that LSY1 is involved in regulation of adaxial/abaxial patterning at the margins of the leaf primordia
    + Additive phenotypes in some leaf traits of lsy1 nal2/3 triple mutants and the unchanged level of NAL2/3 expression in the lsy1 background suggested that LSY1 regulates lateral leaf development independently of NAL2/3
    + Our results indicated that all of the rice WOX3 genes are involved in leaf lateral outgrowth, but the functions of LSY1 and NAL2/3 have diverged
    + Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
