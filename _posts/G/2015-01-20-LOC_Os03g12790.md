* **Key message**  
    + A rice QTL GS3.1 regulates grain size through metabolic-flux distribution between flavonoid and lignin metabolons without affecting stress tolerance.
    + Our demonstration that leaf-derived ABA activates starch synthesis genes explains the incompletely filled and floury seed phenotypes in dg1 Both the DG1-mediated long-distance ABA transport efficiency and grain-filling phenotypes are temperature sensitive
    + Specifically, ABA is biosynthesized in both WT and dg1 leaves, but only WT caryopses accumulate leaf-derived ABA
    + Moreover, we extended these mechanistic insights to other cereals by observing similar grain-filling defects in a maize DG1 ortholog mutant
    + Map-based cloning and molecular biological analyses revealed that GFD1 encoded a MATE transporter and expressed high in vascular tissues of the stem, spikelet hulls and rachilla, but low in the leaf, controlling carbohydrate partitioning in the stem and grain but not in the leaf
    + MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.
    + Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
    + GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2
