* **Key message**  
    + Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis
    + The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GW2, a new QTL that controls rice grain width and weight
    + Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield
    + The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops
    + These findings provide more insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seed size development in rice and are likely to be useful for improving rice grain yield
    + Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
    + Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
    + It was indicated that mutual interactions exist between the two genes, in which, qSW5 affecting seed length is masked by GS3 alleles, and GS3 affecting seed width is masked by qSW5 alleles
    + However, the relationship among these four genes is still unclear, which will impede the process of gene pyramiding breeding program to some extent
    + Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
    + Histochemical ¦Â-glucuronidase staining showed strong expression of GW2 in leaf and root tissues but weak expression in leaf sheaths and internodes
    + Proteomic analysis showed that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitinase 14 (CHT14), and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) accumulated to high levels in the seeds of the natural japonica rice mutant Oochikara, which carries a loss-of-function mutation in the grain width 2 (GW2) gene; GW2 encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase
    + Collectively, these results suggest that GW2 regulates seed size through direct interactions with proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism by modulating their activity or stability and controlling disulfide bond formation in various proteins during seed development
    + Additionally, GW2 participates in vegetative as well as reproductive growth, and protects the seed from pathogen attack
    + Identification of Rice Large Grain Gene GW2 by Whole-Genome Sequencing of a Large Grain-Isogenic Line Integrated with Japonica Native Gene and Its Linkage Relationship with the Co-integrated Semidwarf Gene d60 on Chromosome 2.
    + Whole-genome sequencing on a large grain isogenic Koshihikari (BC4F2) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a single nucleotide deletion in GW2 gene, which is located 8
    + These results suggested that transcriptional regulation was associated with delayed senescence in CR2002, and RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase GW2 was a positive regulator of leaf senescence in rice
    + To determine if GW2 is allelic to qCC2, a gw2-knockout mutant (gw2-ko) was examined using a dark-induced senescence assay
    + The association of the GW2 genotype with the delayed senescence phenotype was confirmed in an F2 population
    + GW2 encoding E3 ubiquitin ligase in the qCC2 region was selected as a candidate for qCC2
    + A RING-Type E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, OsGW2, Controls Chlorophyll Content and Dark-Induced Senescence in Rice.
    + On the basis of these results, we conclude that gw2 mutation has the potential to be an important genetic resource with the ability to achieve a well-balanced and high-yielding effect that simultaneously improves grain productivity and lodging resistance
    + gw2 mutation increases grain width and culm thickness in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)
    + Previously, studies on RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases in cereals were preferentially focused on GW2 genes primarily controlling seed parameters in rice and wheat
    + In summary we conclude that in contrast to inhibition of GW2 genes in rice and wheat plants, down-regulation of the barely HvYrg genes caused substantial changes in vegetative organs in addition to alteration of seed parameters
    + OsGW2 shows high expression in seed development stages and the protein localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + Microscopic observation of grain morphology suggests that OsGW2 determines grain size by influencing both cell expansion and cell proliferation in spikelet hull
    + These results reveal that OsGW2 is a negative regulator of grain size in indica rice and affects both cell number and cell size in spikelet hull
    + A natural variation (single-nucleotide polymorphism at the 346th position) in the functional domain-coding region of OsGW2 in japonica rice genotypes has been shown to cause an increase in grain width/weight in rice
    + In this study, we report that reduced expression of OsGW2 can alter grain size, even though natural sequence variation is not responsible for increased grain size in indica rice genotypes
