* **Key message**  
    + The GH5BG mRNA is highly expressed in the shoot during germination and in leaf sheaths of mature plants
    + The GH5BG was up-regulated in response to salt stress, submergence stress, methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid in rice seedlings
    + " The GH5BG was up-regulated in response to salt stress, submergence stress, methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid in rice seedlings"
