* **Key message**  
    + GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.
    + Genetic interaction analysis reveals that GS9 functions independently from other previously identified grain size genes
    + Introducing the gs9 allele into elite rice cultivars significantly improves grain shape and appearance quality
    + Here, we identify GS9 (Grain Shape Gene on Chromosome 9) gene by map-based cloning
