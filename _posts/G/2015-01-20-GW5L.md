* **Key message**  
    + We also show that GW5L could confer salt stress resistance through an association with calmodulin protein OsCaM1-1
    + These findings identify GW5L as a negative regulator of both grain size and salt stress tolerance, and provide a potential target for breeders to improve grain yield and salt stress resistance in rice
    + GW5L is evenly expressed in various tissues, and its protein product is localized to the plasma membrane
