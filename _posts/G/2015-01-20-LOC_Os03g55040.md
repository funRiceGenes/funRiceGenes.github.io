* **Key message**  
    + GSA1 regulates grain size by modulating cell proliferation and expansion, which are regulated by flavonoid-mediated auxin levels and related gene expression
    + GSA1 overexpression results in larger grains and enhanced abiotic stress tolerance
    + GSA1 is required for the redirection of metabolic flux from lignin biosynthesis to flavonoid biosynthesis under abiotic stress and the accumulation of flavonoid glycosides, which protect rice against abiotic stress
    + GSA1 encodes a UDP-glucosyltransferase, which exhibits glucosyltransferase activity toward flavonoids and monolignols
