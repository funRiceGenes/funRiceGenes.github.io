* **Key message**  
    + OsGF14b Positively Regulates Panicle Blast Resistance, but Negatively Regulates Leaf Blast Resistance in Rice.
    + Previous research demonstrated that OsGF14b plays different roles in panicle and leaf blast resistance
    + Furthermore, mutation and overexpression of OsGF14b affected the expression of stress-related genes under normal growth conditions and/or drought stress conditions
    + Involvement of OsGF14b Adaptation in the Drought Resistance of Rice Plants.
    + In this study, we researched the function of OsGF14b in drought resistance in rice
    + In comparison with wild type (WT), the osgf14b mutant exhibited improved resistance to drought and osmotic stress by changing the content of stress-relevant parameters, complementation of the osgf14b mutant restored the drought sensitivity to WT levels, whereas the OsGF14b-overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drought and osmotic stress
    + We have demonstrated that OsGF14b is involved in the drought resistance of rice plants, partially in an ABA-dependent manner
    + Here, we report that OsGF14b was strongly induced by soil drought stress
    + The osgf14b mutant plants were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), while the OsGF14b-overexpression plants showed reduced sensitivity to ABA
    + Rice G protein ¦Ã subunit qPE9-1 modulates root elongation for phosphorus uptake by involving 14-3-3 protein OsGF14b and plasma membrane H + -ATPase
    + Moreover, the overexpression of OsGF14b in WYJ8 (carrying the qpe9-1 allele) partially increased primary root length under LP conditions
    + These results suggest that the G protein <a6><c3> subunit qPE9-1 in rice plants modulates root elongation for phosphorus uptake by involving the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14b and PM H+ -ATPase, which is required for rice P use
    + The serine acids (Ser258Ser259) residues of OsGF14b play an essential role in BR-mediated responses and plant development
    + qGL3/OsPPKL1 Induces Phosphorylation of 14-3-3 OsGF14b to Inhibit OsBZR1 Function in Brassinosteroid Signaling
    + Genetic and molecular analyses indicated that OsGF14b functions as a negative regulator in BR signaling and represses the transcriptional activation activity of OsBZR1
    + OsGF14b is involved in regulating coarse root and fine root biomass partitioning in response to elevated [CO(2)] in rice.
    + Our results indicate that knockout of OsGF14b may improve the response to elevated [CO(2)] in rice by enhancing carbon allocation to coarse roots and to fine lateral roots
