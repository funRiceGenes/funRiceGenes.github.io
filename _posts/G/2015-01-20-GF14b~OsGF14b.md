* **Key message**  
    + OsGF14b Positively Regulates Panicle Blast Resistance, but Negatively Regulates Leaf Blast Resistance in Rice.
    + Previous research demonstrated that OsGF14b plays different roles in panicle and leaf blast resistance
    + Furthermore, mutation and overexpression of OsGF14b affected the expression of stress-related genes under normal growth conditions and/or drought stress conditions
    + Involvement of OsGF14b Adaptation in the Drought Resistance of Rice Plants.
    + In this study, we researched the function of OsGF14b in drought resistance in rice
    + In comparison with wild type (WT), the osgf14b mutant exhibited improved resistance to drought and osmotic stress by changing the content of stress-relevant parameters, complementation of the osgf14b mutant restored the drought sensitivity to WT levels, whereas the OsGF14b-overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drought and osmotic stress
    + We have demonstrated that OsGF14b is involved in the drought resistance of rice plants, partially in an ABA-dependent manner
    + Here, we report that OsGF14b was strongly induced by soil drought stress
    + The osgf14b mutant plants were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), while the OsGF14b-overexpression plants showed reduced sensitivity to ABA
