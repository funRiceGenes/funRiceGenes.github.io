## Key message
1. __cell cycle__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  FSM/FAS1 and GTE4 are known in rice and Arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively
2. __transcription factor__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
3. __shoot__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
4. __auxin__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
5. __auxin__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
6. __root__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  FSM/FAS1 and GTE4 are known in rice and Arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively
