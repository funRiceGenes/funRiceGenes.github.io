## Key message
1. __fertility__, [The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, we found that RF5 and GRP162 are both components of a restoration of fertility complex (RFC) that is 400 to 500 kD in size and can cleave CMS-associated transcripts in vitro

3. __sterile__, [The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162%5BTitle%5D), The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162

## Connection
1. __GRP162__, __Rf1a~Rf5__, [The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162%5BTitle%5D),  RF5, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, was unable to bind to this CMS-associated transcript; however, a partner protein of RF5 (GRP162, a Gly-rich protein encoding 162 amino acids) was identified to bind to atp6-orfH79
2. __GRP162__, __Rf1a~Rf5__, [The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162%5BTitle%5D),  GRP162 was found to physically interact with RF5 and to bind to atp6-orfH79 via an RNA recognition motif

5. __GRP162__, __RFC3__, [The rice DUF1620-containing and WD40-like repeat protein is required for the assembly of the restoration of fertility complex.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice DUF1620-containing and WD40-like repeat protein is required for the assembly of the restoration of fertility complex.%5BTitle%5D),  We established that RFC3 interacts with both RF5 and GRP162 in vitro and in vivo, and is transported into the mitochondria as a membrane protein
