* **Key message**  
    + Here, we have examined a long sterile lemma1 (g1) mutant, in which the sterile lemma is enlarged like the lemma
    + Detailed phenotypic analysis reveals that the large sterile lemma in the g1 mutant appears to be caused by homeotic transformation of the sterile lemma into a lemma, suggesting that G1 is involved in the repression of lemma identity to specify the sterile lemma
    + G1 mRNA is expressed in sterile lemma primordia throughout their development, and G1 protein is localized in the nucleus
    + We also show that a wild rice species, Oryza grandiglumis, that forms large sterile lemmas has serious mutations in the G1 gene
    + The homeotic gene long sterile lemma (G1) specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet
    + Repression of lemma identity by G1 is consistent with a hypothesis proposed to explain the morphological evolution of rice spikelets
    + Generally, our findings provided valuable information for better understanding functions of G1 and OsLHS1 in flower development and identities of empty glumes

    + __BLS1~BSG1~OsG1L6~TH1~AFD1__, __G1__, [A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We then examined the effect of th1 mutation on the lemma-like structure formed in the long sterile lemma/glume1 (g1) and extra glume1 (eg1) mutants
    + __BLS1~BSG1~OsG1L6~TH1~AFD1__, __G1__, [A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The result showed that the th1 mutation strongly affected the morphology of the extra lemma of eg1, but had no significant effect on the transformed lemma of g1
