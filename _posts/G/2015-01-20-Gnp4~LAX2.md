* **Key message**  
    + In addition, the Gnp4 and Lax1-1 double mutant showed dramatically reduced secondary branches and spikelets in panicle at reproductive stage, and tillers at vegetative stage
    + Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch in the panicle
    + The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage
    + The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching
    + In this study, we identified a natural mutant, gnp4, lack of lateral spikelet on the secondary branches in the field condition
    + Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation
