* **Key message**  
    + GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.
    + The green - revertible yellow79 mutant resulting from a single-base mutation suggested that the GRY79 gene encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice
    + Therefore, we have confirmed that the gry79 mutant phenotype resulted from a single-base mutation in GRY79 (Os02g33610) gene, suggesting that the gene encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice
