* **Key message**  
    + A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator.
    + GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator.
    + The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield.
    + We demonstrate that a 2â€…bp substitution mutation in GS2 perturbs OsmiR396-directed regulation of GS2, resulting in large and heavy grains and increased grain yield
    + Further results reveal that GS2 interacts with the transcription coactivitors OsGIF1/2/3, and overexpression of OsGIF1 increases grain size and weight
    + Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development
    + OsGRF4 controls grain shape, panicle length and seed shattering in rice.
    + Higher expression of OsGRF4 is correlated with larger grain, longer panicle and lower seed shattering
    + Further research showed that OsGRF4 regulated two cytokinin dehydrogenase precursor genes (CKX5 and CKX1) resulting in increased cytokinin levels, which might affect the panicle traits
    + High storage capacity and moderate seed shattering of OsGRF4 may be useful in high-yield breeding and mechanized harvesting of rice
    + The mutation in OsGRF4 perturbs the OsmiR396 target regulation of OsGRF4, generating a larger grain size and enhanced grain yield
    + LGS1 encodes the OsGRF4 transcription factor and contains a 2-basepair missense mutation in the coding region that coincides with the putative pairing site of microRNA396
    + In addition to producing larger grains, LGS1 also enhanced cold tolerance at the seedling stage and increased the survival rate of seedlings after cold stress treatment
    + A Missense Mutation in LGS1 Increases Grain Size and Enhances Cold Tolerance in Rice.
    + Here, a semi-dominant QTL, designated Large Grain Size 1 (LGS1), was cloned and the potential molecular mechanism of LGS1 function was studied
    + These findings indicate that the mutation in LGS1 appears to disturb the GRF4-miR396-stress response network and results in the development of enlarged grains and enhancement of cold tolerance in rice
    + Accumulation of OsGRF4 enhances nitrogen usage and metabolism, and increases grain size and grain yield
    + Taken together, our results suggest that variation in OsGRF4 affects proper transcriptional and splicing regulation of genes under HS, and that this can be mediated by, and also feed back to, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in a reduction in the heat tolerance of rice anthers
    + The rice variety grain size on chromosome 2 (GS2) contains sequence variations of OsGRF4 (Oryza sativa growth-regulating factor 4; OsGRF4(AA) ), escaping the microRNA miR396-mediated degradation of this gene at the mRNA level
