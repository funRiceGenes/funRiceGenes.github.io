## Key message
1. __seed__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
2. __seed__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress
3. __reproductive__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The developmental defects of gnt1 ultimately resulted in early lethality without transition to the reproductive stage
4. __salt__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), " However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress"
5. __cell wall__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
6. __cytokinin__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  sativa response regulators that are rapidly induced by cytokinins in gnt1 confirmed that cytokinin signaling is impaired in the mutant
7. __cellulose__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
8. __seedling__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
9. __tiller__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
10. __salt stress__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), " However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress"
