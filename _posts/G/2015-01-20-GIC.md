## Key message
1. __growth__, [A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Characterization of gic phenotypes in a rice field showed that gic exhibited defective growth in seed setting, suggesting that the gic mutant negatively affects the reproductive stage
2. __seed__, [A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Characterization of gic phenotypes in a rice field showed that gic exhibited defective growth in seed setting, suggesting that the gic mutant negatively affects the reproductive stage
