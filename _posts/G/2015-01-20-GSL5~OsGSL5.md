## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
2. __fertility__, [GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
3. __microspore__, [GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
4. __development__, [GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 GSL5 plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
