* **Key message**  
    + These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
    + In Osgsl5 mutant anthers mostly lacking callose deposition, aberrant PMCs accompanied by aggregated, unpaired, or multivalent chromosomes were frequently observed and, furthermore, a considerable number of mutant PMCs had untimely progress into meiosis compared to that of wild-type PMCs
    + Immunostaining of meiosis-specific protein HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS2 in premeiotic PMCs revealed precocious meiosis entry in Osgsl5 anthers
