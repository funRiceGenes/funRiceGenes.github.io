* **Key message**  
    + The 14-3-3 protein GF14f negatively affects grain filling of inferior spikelets of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Using GF14f-RNAi plants, we observed that a reduction in GF14f expression in the endosperm resulted in a significant increase in both grain length and weight, which in turn improved grain yield
    + These results suggest that GF14f negatively affects grain development and filling, and the observed higher abundance of the GF14f protein in IS compared to SS may be responsible for poor IS grain filling
    + The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying poor grain filling of IS and suggests that GF14f could serve as a potential tool for improving rice grain filling
    + Furthermore, pull-down assays indicated that GF14f interacts with enzymes that are involved in sucrose breakdown, starch synthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis
    + Overexpression of OsGF14f Enhances Quantitative Leaf Blast and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.
    + Here, we showed that the transcription of OsGF14f was significantly induced by leaf blast infection, and the overexpression of OsGF14f quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast and bacterial blight in rice
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsGF14f positively regulates leaf blast and bacterial blight resistance in rice via the SA-dependent signaling pathway
    + Although it is known that rice 14-3-3 family genes are involved in various defense responses, the functions of OsGF14f in response to diseases have not been reported
    + In addition, the expression level of OsGF14f was significantly induced after SA treatment, and higher endogenous SA levels were observed in the OsGF14f-overexpressing plants compared with that in wild-type plants, especially after blast challenge
    + GF14f gene is negatively associated with yield and grain chalkiness under rice ratooning.
    + CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that this genetic regulation by GF14f gene was the main cause leading to changes in rice yield and grain chalkiness improvement of ratoon rice, irrespective of seasonal or environmental effects
    + A further significance was to see how yield performance and grain quality of ratoon rice were able to be achieved at higher levels via suppression of GF14f
    + Furthermore, these variations were shown to be associated with a protein-coding gene: GF14f (encoding GF14f isoform of 14-3-3 proteins) and such gene negatively impacts oxidative and environmental resistance in ratoon rice
