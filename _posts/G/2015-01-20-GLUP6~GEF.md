## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  Overall, our results indicate that GLUP6/GEF is the activator of Rab5 GTPase and that the cycling of GTP- and GDP-bound forms of this regulatory protein is essential for the intracellular transport of proglutelin and alpha-globulin from the Golgi to PSVs and in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in rice seeds
2. __endosperm__, [A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  Immunofluorescence studies showed that the transport of proglutelins and alpha-globulins to PSV was disrupted in glup6 endosperm
3. __endosperm__, [A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  Secreted granules of glutelin and alpha-globulin were readily observed in young glup6 endosperm, followed by the formation of large dilated paramural bodies PMBs containing both proteins as the endosperm matures
