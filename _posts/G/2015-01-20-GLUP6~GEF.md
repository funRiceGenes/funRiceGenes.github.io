* **Key message**  
    + Overall, our results indicate that GLUP6/GEF is the activator of Rab5 GTPase and that the cycling of GTP- and GDP-bound forms of this regulatory protein is essential for the intracellular transport of proglutelin and alpha-globulin from the Golgi to PSVs and in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in rice seeds
    + Immunofluorescence studies showed that the transport of proglutelins and alpha-globulins to PSV was disrupted in glup6 endosperm
    + Secreted granules of glutelin and alpha-globulin were readily observed in young glup6 endosperm, followed by the formation of large dilated paramural bodies (PMBs) containing both proteins as the endosperm matures
