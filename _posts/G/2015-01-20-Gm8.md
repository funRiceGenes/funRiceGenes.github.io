* **Key message**  
    + The indica rice variety Aganni, a landrace from the state of Kerala, is known to carry the gall midge resistance gene Gm8 with HR-type of resistance
    + Validation of this gene in five gall midge resistant rice varieties carrying different resistance genes revealed that the induction was unique to Aganni rice carrying Gm8 gene
