* **Key message**  
    + The 14-3-3 protein GF14f negatively affects grain filling of inferior spikelets of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Using GF14f-RNAi plants, we observed that a reduction in GF14f expression in the endosperm resulted in a significant increase in both grain length and weight, which in turn improved grain yield
    + These results suggest that GF14f negatively affects grain development and filling, and the observed higher abundance of the GF14f protein in IS compared to SS may be responsible for poor IS grain filling
    + The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying poor grain filling of IS and suggests that GF14f could serve as a potential tool for improving rice grain filling
    + Furthermore, pull-down assays indicated that GF14f interacts with enzymes that are involved in sucrose breakdown, starch synthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis
