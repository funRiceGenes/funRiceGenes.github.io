* **Key message**  
    + The results of this study will provide insight into the characteristics and evolution of NB-ARC family and suggest that GNP12 positively regulates panicle development
    + The GNP12 gene encodes RGH1A protein, which regulates rice yield according to panicle length, grain number of panicle, and grain length, with eight major haplotypes
