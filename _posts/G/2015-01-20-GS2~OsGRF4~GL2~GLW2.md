    + A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator.
    + GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator.
    + The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield.
    + We demonstrate that a 2 bp substitution mutation in GS2 perturbs OsmiR396-directed regulation of GS2, resulting in large and heavy grains and increased grain yield
    + Further results reveal that GS2 interacts with the transcription coactivitors OsGIF1/2/3, and overexpression of OsGIF1 increases grain size and weight
    + Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development
    + OsGRF4 controls grain shape, panicle length and seed shattering in rice.
    + Higher expression of OsGRF4 is correlated with larger grain, longer panicle and lower seed shattering
    + Further research showed that OsGRF4 regulated two cytokinin dehydrogenase precursor genes (CKX5 and CKX1) resulting in increased cytokinin levels, which might affect the panicle traits
    + High storage capacity and moderate seed shattering of OsGRF4 may be useful in high-yield breeding and mechanized harvesting of rice
    + The mutation in OsGRF4 perturbs the OsmiR396 target regulation of OsGRF4, generating a larger grain size and enhanced grain yield
