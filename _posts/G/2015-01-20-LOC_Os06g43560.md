* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPA5 physically interacts with a class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex and a seed plant-specific VAMP727-containing R-soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex
    + We show that GPA5 is a membrane-associated protein capable of forming homodimers and that it is specifically localized to DVs in developing endosperm
    + Collectively, our results suggest that GPA5 functions as a plant-specific effector of Rab5a required for mediating tethering and membrane fusion of DVs with PSVs in rice endosperm
