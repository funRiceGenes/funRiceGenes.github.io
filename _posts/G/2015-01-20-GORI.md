* **Key message**  
    + WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.
    + GORI encodes a seven-WD40-motif protein that interacts with an AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH)-domain protein, which modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and regulates Rac6 activity in the apical plasma membrane of elongating pollen tubes
    + Loss of function of GORI or Rac6 reduces pollen germination and tube growth, thereby resulting in male sterility in rice
    + In contrast, overexpression of Rac6 increases pollen tube elongation, with this effect being rescued by GORI overexpression
    + Our findings demonstrated that the GORI protein is a positive regulator of pollen germination and tube growth, serving as a link between Rac6 activity regulation and ANTH-mediated endocytosis
