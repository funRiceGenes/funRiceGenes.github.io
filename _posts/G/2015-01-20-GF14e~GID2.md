26. __GF14e~GID2__, __SLR1~OsGAI__, [Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant%5BTitle%5D),  Conversely, overproduction of GID1 or treatment with GA(3) increased the SLR1 level in gid2 and reduced dwarfism
27. __GF14e~GID2__, __SLR1~OsGAI__, [Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant%5BTitle%5D),  These results indicate that derepression of SLR1 repressive activity can be accomplished by GA and GID1 alone and does not require F-box (GID2) function
28. __GF14e~GID2__, __SLR1~OsGAI__, [Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant%5BTitle%5D),  Evidence for GA signaling without GID2 was also provided by the expression behavior of GA-regulated genes such as GA-20oxidase1, GID1, and SLR1 in the gid2 mutant
29. __GF14e~GID2__, __SLR1~OsGAI__, [Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant%5BTitle%5D), Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant
