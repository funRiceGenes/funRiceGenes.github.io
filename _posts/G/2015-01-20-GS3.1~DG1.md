* **Key message**  
    + A rice QTL GS3.1 regulates grain size through metabolic-flux distribution between flavonoid and lignin metabolons without affecting stress tolerance.
    + Our demonstration that leaf-derived ABA activates starch synthesis genes explains the incompletely filled and floury seed phenotypes in dg1 Both the DG1-mediated long-distance ABA transport efficiency and grain-filling phenotypes are temperature sensitive
    + Specifically, ABA is biosynthesized in both WT and dg1 leaves, but only WT caryopses accumulate leaf-derived ABA
    + Moreover, we extended these mechanistic insights to other cereals by observing similar grain-filling defects in a maize DG1 ortholog mutant
