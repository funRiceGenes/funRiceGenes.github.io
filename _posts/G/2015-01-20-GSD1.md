## Expression information

## Key message
1. __grain setting__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D)), Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance
2. __photoassimilate translocation__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D)), Together, our results suggest that GSD1 may play a role in regulating photoassimilate translocation through the symplastic pathway to impact grain setting in rice.
3. __plasma membrane__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D)), GSD1 was found to be specifically expressed in the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata (PD) of phloem companion cells.
4. __grain filling__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D)), Experimental evidence suggests the phenotype of the gsd1-D mutant is caused by defects in the grain filling process as a result of the impaired transport of carbohydrates from the photosynthetic site to the phloem.

## Connection
1. __GSD1__, __OsACT1__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D)), GSD1 functioned in affecting PD conductance by interacting with OsACT1 in association with the PD callose binding protein PDCB1.
2. __GSD1__, __OsACT1~OsActin-1__, [Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.%5BTitle%5D)), Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.
3. __GSD1__, __OsACT1~OsActin-1__, [Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain in GSD1 is necessary for sufficient interaction with OsACT1
4. __GSD1__, __OsACT1~OsActin-1__, [Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, these results reveal that GSD1 attaches to the PM through S-acylation and interacts with OsACT1 through its coiled-coil domain structure to regulate plasmodesmata conductance for photoassimilate transport in rice
