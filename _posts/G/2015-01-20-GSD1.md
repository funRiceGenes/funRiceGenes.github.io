* **Key message**  
    + Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance
    + Together, our results suggest that GSD1 may play a role in regulating photoassimilate translocation through the symplastic pathway to impact grain setting in rice.
    + GSD1 was found to be specifically expressed in the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata (PD) of phloem companion cells.
    + Experimental evidence suggests the phenotype of the gsd1-D mutant is caused by defects in the grain filling process as a result of the impaired transport of carbohydrates from the photosynthetic site to the phloem.
