* **Key message**  
    + The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants
    + ILA1 is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints
    + We report here the characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, increased leaf angle1 (ila1), resulting from a T-DNA insertion in a Group C MAPKKK gene
    + Microarray analyses of leaf lamina joints provided additional evidence for alterations in mechanical strength in ila1
    + ILA1 is thus a key factor regulating mechanical tissue formation at the leaf lamina joint
