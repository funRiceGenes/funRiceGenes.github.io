* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Real-time RT-PCR and GUS activity assays revealed that IBF1 specifically expressed in reproductive tissues
    + In the ibf1 mutant, brown pigments specifically accumulate in hull furrows during seed maturation and reach a maximum level in dry seeds
