* **Key message**  
    + RNA-seq results revealed that 84% of genes upregulated by IRP1 peptide were also induced by a microbe-associated molecular pattern(MAMP) chitin, including 13 OsWRKY transcription factors, indicating that IRP1 and chitin share a similar signaling pathway
    + Rice plants overexpressing IRP1 enhanced resistance to the virulent rice blast fungus
    + Application of IRP1 peptide to rice suspension cells triggered the expression of IRP1 itself and the defense gene PAL1
    + Here, we studied IRP1 functions in rice immunity
    + Collectively, our findings indicate that IRP1 functions as a phytocyokine in rice immunity regulating MAPKs and OsWRKYs that could amplify chitin and other signaling pathways, and provide new insights into how MAMPs and phytocyokines cooperatively regulate rice immunity
