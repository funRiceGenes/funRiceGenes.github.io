## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study we found that the rice Aux/IAA gene OsIAA6 is highly induced by drought stress and that its overexpression in transgenic rice improved drought tolerance, likely via the regulation of auxin biosynthesis genes  
__OverExpression__: In this study we found that the rice Aux/IAA gene OsIAA6 is highly induced by drought stress and that its overexpression in transgenic rice improved drought tolerance, likely via the regulation of auxin biosynthesis genes  
__RNAi__:
