* **Key message**  
    + A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1
    + Our results confirm that the OsIAA6 gene is involved in drought stress responses and the control of tiller outgrowth
    + In this study we found that the rice Aux/IAA gene OsIAA6 is highly induced by drought stress and that its overexpression in transgenic rice improved drought tolerance, likely via the regulation of auxin biosynthesis genes
    + We observed that OsIAA6 was specifically expressed in the axillary meristem of the basal stem, which is the tissue that gives rise to tillers
