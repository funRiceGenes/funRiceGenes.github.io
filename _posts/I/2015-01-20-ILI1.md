* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI1 increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a positive role of ILI1 in leaf bending
    + ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis
    + We identified a rice mutant (ili1-D) showing an increased lamina inclination phenotype similar to that caused by BR treatment
    + BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1
    + Thus, ILI1 and PRE1 may inactivate inhibitory bHLH transcription factors through heterodimerization
    + The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest
    + LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
    + Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis
