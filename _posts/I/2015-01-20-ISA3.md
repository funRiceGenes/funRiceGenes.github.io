## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
2. __endosperm__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm
3. __endosperm__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm
4. __endosperm__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules
5. __starch__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night
6. __starch__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm
7. __starch__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant
8. __starch__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules
9. __starch__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice
10. __leaf__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night
11. __leaf__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
12. __seedling__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
