* **Key message**  
    + Here we report a novel A20/AN1-type zinc finger protein ZFP185 involved in GA and ABA signaling in the regulation of growth and stress response
    + Our study suggests that ZFP185 regulates plant growth and stress responses by affecting GA and ABA biosynthesis in rice
    + Moreover, it was found that ZFP185, unlike previously known A20/AN1-type zinc finger genes, increases sensitivity to drought, cold, and salt stresses, implying the negative role of ZFP185 in stress tolerance
    + Besides GA, overexpression of ZFP185 decreased ABA content and expression of several ABA biosynthesis-related genes
    + The application of exogenous GA3 can fully rescue the semi-dwarfism phenotype of ZFP185 overexpressing plants, suggesting the negative role of ZFP185 in GA biosynthesis
    + ZFP185 was localized in the cytoplasm and lacked transcriptional activation potential
