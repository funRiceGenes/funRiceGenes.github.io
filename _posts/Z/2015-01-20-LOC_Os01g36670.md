    + The Rice DNA-Binding Protein ZBED Controls Stress Regulators and Maintains Disease Resistance After a Mild Drought
    + We have previously described the role of the rice ZBED protein containing three Zn-finger BED domains in disease resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
    + More importantly, the disease resistance response conferred by ZBED is not compromised by drought-induced stress
    + Conclusions: Together our data indicate that ZBED might represent a new type of transcriptional regulator playing simultaneously a positive role in both disease resistance and drought tolerance
    + Interestingly, ZBED overexpressor rice lines show increased drought tolerance
    + Results: Using Nicotiana benthamiana as a heterologous system, we show that ZBED localizes in the nucleus, binds DNA, and triggers basal immunity
