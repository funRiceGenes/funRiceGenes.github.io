    + __ZEP1~OsZEP__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D), Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants
