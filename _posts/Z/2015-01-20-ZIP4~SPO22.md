## Connection
1. __ZEP1__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1
2. __ZEP1__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants
3. __ZEP1__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1
4. __MER3~RCK__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1
5. __MER3~RCK__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes
