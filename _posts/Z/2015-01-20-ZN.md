    + [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D), 2010, Plant J.

    + [EU430513](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU430513)

* **Key message**  
    + Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development
    + Together, we propose that ZN is required for protecting developing chloroplasts, especially during the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes, from incidental light after darkness

    + __OsMTP11__, __ZN__, [Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.%5BTitle%5D),  Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
    + __OsMTP11__, __ZN__, [Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.%5BTitle%5D),  DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress
