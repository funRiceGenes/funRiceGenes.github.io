## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development
2. __chloroplast__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development
3. __chloroplast__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, we propose that ZN is required for protecting developing chloroplasts, especially during the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes, from incidental light after darkness
4. __leaf__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development
