* **Key message**  
    + ZL16 was ubiquitously expressed in various plant organs, with a pronounced level in the young leaf
    + The zl16 mutant showed chlorotic abnormalities in the transverse sectors of the young leaves of seedlings
    + The use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that dramatic defects occurred in variegated zl16 leaves during the early development of a chloroplast
    + A subcellular localization experiment indicated that ZL16 was targeted in the chloroplast
    + Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of some nuclear genes involved in chloroplast development, and found they were altered in the zl16 mutant
    + Map-based cloning revealed that ZL16 encodes a ¦Â-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HAD) involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis
