* **Key message**  
    + Overproduction of ZFP245 enhanced the activities of reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes under stress conditions and increased the tolerance of rice seedlings to oxidative stress
    + However, ZFP245 was not regulated by high salt or abscisic acid treatment
    + The semi-quantitative-RT-PCR assay revealed ZFP245 was strongly induced after 6 h exposure to cold and drought stresses, and then reduced to the baseline
    + Taken together, ZFP245, as the first identified C2H2-type zinc finger protein involved in stress response in monocots probably plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant cold and drought responses through an ABA-independent pathway
    + A C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP245 was cloned by RT-PCR approach from cold treated rice seedlings
    + Our data suggest that ZFP245 may contribute to the tolerance of rice plants to cold and drought stresses by regulating proline levels and reactive oxygen species-scavenging activities, and therefore may be useful for developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress
    + ZFP245 is a cold- and drought-responsive gene that encodes a zinc finger protein in rice
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ZFP245 were generated and found to display high tolerance to cold and drought stresses
    + Increased tolerance of rice to cold, drought and oxidative stresses mediated by the overexpression of a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein ZFP245
    + Tissue expression analysis showed that ZFP245 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues including roots, stems, leaves and spikes
