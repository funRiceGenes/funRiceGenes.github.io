* **Key message**  
    + The expression of Z15 is induced by moderate low temperature (18<U+2009>Â°C)
    + The mutation of Z15 influenced the expression of two downstream genes, OsWRKY71 and OsMYB4, that were responsive to moderate low temperature
    + The results show that Z15 plays a crucial role in the early stages of the response to moderate low temperature in rice
    + Further study indiceted that Z15 plays a crucial role in the early stages of the response to moderate low temperature in rice
    + Subcellular localization analysis indicates that Z15 and z15 are localized on the plasma membrane
