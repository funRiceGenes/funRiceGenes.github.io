* **Key message**  
    + Anatomical investigations revealed that the culms of nal1 also show a defective vascular system, in which the number and distribution pattern of vascular bundles are altered
    + These results indicate that Nal1 affects polar auxin transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf growth
    + To understand the molecular mechanism governing plant leaf shape, we characterized a classic rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant named narrow leaf1 (nal1), which exhibits a characteristic phenotype of narrow leaves
    + In accordance with reduced leaf blade width, leaves of nal1 contain a decreased number of longitudinal veins
    + NAL1 allele from a rice landrace greatly increases yield in modern indica cultivars
    + We provide evidence showing that Nal1 is richly expressed in vascular tissues and that mutation of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar auxin transport capacity
    + 8 kb interval between the SSR loci RM17483 and RM17486, a region which also contains the gene NAL1 (Narrow leaf 1)
    + The analysis of expression of other known genes involved in the determination of leaf width provided no evidence of their having any clear functional association with qFLW4/NAL1
    + Fine mapping of a major QTL for flag leaf width in rice, qFLW4, which might be caused by alternative splicing of NAL1
    + Map-based cloning revealed that SPIKE was identical to NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), which has been reported to control vein pattern in leaf
    + Previous studies have shown that NAL1 plays a role in regulating vein patterning and increasing grain yield in indica cultivars, but its role in leaf growth and development remains unknown
    + We demonstrated that NAL1 functions in the regulation of cell division as early as during leaf primordia initiation
    + These results suggest that NAL1 controls leaf width and plant height through its effects on cell division
    + Map-based cloning revealed that nal1-2 is a null allelic mutant of NAL1 since both the whole promoter and a 404-bp fragment in the first exon of NAL1 were deleted, and that a 6-bp fragment was deleted in the mutant nal1-3
    + Characterization of a Null Allelic Mutant of the Rice NAL1 Gene Reveals Its Role in Regulating Cell Division.
    + Heterogenous expression of NAL1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) further supported that NAL1 affects cell division
    + The altered transcript level of G1- and S-phase-specific genes suggested that NAL1 affects cell cycle regulation
    + This NAL1 allele also increases light capture and whole-leaf nitrogen content of the lower leaves and is associated with slower senescence in flag leaves
    + This NAL1 allele increases LNC and photosynthetic rate per leaf area in flag leaves but does not increase whole-leaf photosynthesis
    + Partial loss-of-function of NAL1 alters canopy photosynthesis by changing the contribution of upper and lower canopy leaves in rice.
    + These results suggest that this NAL1 allele does not increase whole-leaf photosynthesis but plays a role in regulating spatial and temporal trade-offs among traits at the whole-plant level
    + Previous studies have shown that NAL1 modulates leaf size by affecting vein patterning and cell division; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear
    + Here, we report that the nal1 mutant shows reduced size of the leaf abaxial epidermal cells and culm parenchyma cells compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that NAL1 also regulates cell expansion
    + These results indicate that, in addition to controlling cell division, NAL1 controls leaf width, at least partially, through its effect on cell expansion, probably via the acid growth mechanism
    + To understand the molecular mechanism of the reduced cell size phenotype, leaves of 40-day-old nal1 mutant and WT seedlings were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis, which has identified 4277 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and the nal1 mutant
    + A combination of RNA-Seq analysis and gene expression validation using RT-qPCR suggested that NAL1 is involved in the regulation of auxin-mediated acid growth in rice
    + Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed a large number of genes down-regulated in the nal1 mutant were involved in cell wall formation
    + Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.
    + Although the NAL1 and GNP1 genes regulating the rice GNP and grain yield have been cloned, their allelic diversity, functional differences in rice germplasms, and effects of their combination on GNP and grain yield remain unclear
    + Our results indicated that the GNP1 and NAL1 exhibited obvious differentiation and their combinations can significantly increase the grain yield in geng rice cultivars
    + These observations provide insights into the molecular basis of the GNP and may be useful for rice breeding of high yield potential by pyramiding GNP1 and NAL1
    + A comparative transcriptome analysis of the mutant and the wild-type rice revealed 263 differentially expressed genes involved in cell division, cell expansion, photosynthesis, reproduction, and gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroids (BR) signaling pathways, suggesting the important regulatory role of nal1
    + Our study indicated that nal1 controls plant architecture through the regulation of genes involved in the photosynthetic apparatus, cell cycle, and GA and BR signaling pathways
    + The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant
    + In this study, we systematically measured leaf photosynthetic parameters, leaf anatomical parameters, architectural parameters, and agronomic traits in indica cultivar 9311, in 9311 with the native NAL1 replaced by the Nipponbare NAL1 (9311-NIL), and in 9311 with the NAL1 fully mutated (9311-nal1)
    + RNA-seq analysis showed that NAL1 negatively regulates the expression of photosynthesis-related genes; NAL1 also influenced expression of many genes related to phytohormone signaling, as also shown by different leaf contents of 3-Indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, Gibberellin A3, and isopentenyladenine among these genotypes
    + This study shows both direct and indirect effects of NAL1 on leaf photosynthesis; furthermore, we show that a partially functional NAL1 allele helps maintain a balanced leaf photosynthesis and plant architecture for increased biomass and grain yield in the field
