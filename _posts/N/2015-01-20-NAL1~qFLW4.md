* **Key message**  
    + Anatomical investigations revealed that the culms of nal1 also show a defective vascular system, in which the number and distribution pattern of vascular bundles are altered
    + These results indicate that Nal1 affects polar auxin transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf growth
    + To understand the molecular mechanism governing plant leaf shape, we characterized a classic rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant named narrow leaf1 (nal1), which exhibits a characteristic phenotype of narrow leaves
    + In accordance with reduced leaf blade width, leaves of nal1 contain a decreased number of longitudinal veins
    + NAL1 allele from a rice landrace greatly increases yield in modern indica cultivars
    + We provide evidence showing that Nal1 is richly expressed in vascular tissues and that mutation of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar auxin transport capacity
    + 8 kb interval between the SSR loci RM17483 and RM17486, a region which also contains the gene NAL1 (Narrow leaf 1)
    + The analysis of expression of other known genes involved in the determination of leaf width provided no evidence of their having any clear functional association with qFLW4/NAL1
    + Fine mapping of a major QTL for flag leaf width in rice, qFLW4, which might be caused by alternative splicing of NAL1
    + Map-based cloning revealed that SPIKE was identical to NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), which has been reported to control vein pattern in leaf
    + Previous studies have shown that NAL1 plays a role in regulating vein patterning and increasing grain yield in indica cultivars, but its role in leaf growth and development remains unknown
    + We demonstrated that NAL1 functions in the regulation of cell division as early as during leaf primordia initiation
    + These results suggest that NAL1 controls leaf width and plant height through its effects on cell division
    + Map-based cloning revealed that nal1-2 is a null allelic mutant of NAL1 since both the whole promoter and a 404-bp fragment in the first exon of NAL1 were deleted, and that a 6-bp fragment was deleted in the mutant nal1-3
    + Characterization of a Null Allelic Mutant of the Rice NAL1 Gene Reveals Its Role in Regulating Cell Division.
    + Heterogenous expression of NAL1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) further supported that NAL1 affects cell division
    + The altered transcript level of G1- and S-phase-specific genes suggested that NAL1 affects cell cycle regulation
    + This NAL1 allele also increases light capture and whole-leaf nitrogen content of the lower leaves and is associated with slower senescence in flag leaves
    + This NAL1 allele increases LNC and photosynthetic rate per leaf area in flag leaves but does not increase whole-leaf photosynthesis
    + Partial loss-of-function of NAL1 alters canopy photosynthesis by changing the contribution of upper and lower canopy leaves in rice.
    + These results suggest that this NAL1 allele does not increase whole-leaf photosynthesis but plays a role in regulating spatial and temporal trade-offs among traits at the whole-plant level
