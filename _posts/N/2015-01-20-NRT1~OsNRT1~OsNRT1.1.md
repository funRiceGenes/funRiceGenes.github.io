## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root hair__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice%5BTitle%5D),  Northern-blot and in situ hybridization analysis indicated that OsNRT1 is constitutively expressed in the most external layer of the root, epidermis and root hair
2. __nitrate__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice%5BTitle%5D),  As a first step toward that goal, we have cloned a nitrate transporter gene from rice called OsNRT1
3. __nitrate__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsNRT1 is a new member of a growing transporter family called PTR, which consists not only of nitrate transporters from higher plants that are homologs of the Arabidopsis CHL1 (AtNRT1) protein, but also peptide transporters from a wide variety of genera including animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria
4. __nitrate__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, despite the fact that OsNRT1 shares a higher degree of sequence identity with the two peptide transporters from plants (approximately 50%) than with the nitrate transporters (approximately 40%) of the PTR family, no peptide transport activity was observed when OsNRT1 was expressed in either Xenopus oocytes or yeast
5. __nitrate__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, contrasting the dual-affinity nitrate transport activity of CHL1, OsNRT1 displayed only low-affinity nitrate transport activity in Xenopus oocytes, with a K(m) value of approximately 9 mM
6. __nitrate__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data strongly indicate that OsNRT1 encodes a constitutive component of a low-affinity nitrate uptake system for rice
