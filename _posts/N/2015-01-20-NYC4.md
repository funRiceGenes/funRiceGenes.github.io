* **Key message**  
    + From a rice mutant population generated by ionizing radiation, we isolated nyc4-1, a stay-green mutant with a defect in chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence
    + Western blot analysis revealed that, in nyc4-1, the PSII core subunits D1 and D2 were significantly retained during leaf senescence in comparison with wild-type and other non-functional stay-green mutants, including sgr-2, a mutant of the key regulator of chlorophyll degradation SGR
    + The role of NYC4 in degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll - protein complexes during leaf senescence is discussed
    + NYC4, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis THF1, is involved in the degradation of chlorophyll - protein complexes during leaf senescence
