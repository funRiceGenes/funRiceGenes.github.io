    + __NEF__, __OsBip1__, [OsFes1C, a potential nucleotide exchange factor for OsBiP1, is involved in the ER and salt stress responses ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFes1C, a potential nucleotide exchange factor for OsBiP1, is involved in the ER and salt stress responses %5BTitle%5D),  OsFes1C interacts directly with OsBiP1 and the interaction is inhibited by ATP but promoted by ADP, suggesting that OsFes1C acts as a potential NEF of OsBiP1 in vivo
