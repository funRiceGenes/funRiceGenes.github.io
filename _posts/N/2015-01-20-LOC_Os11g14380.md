* **Key message**  
    + In addition, because the morphology and constitutive defense responses of nls1-1D were not suppressed by blocking SA or NPR1 transcript accumulation, we suggest that NLS1 mediates both SA and NPR1-independent defense signaling pathways in rice
    + In this study, we characterized the semi-dominant mutant nls1-1D (necrotic leaf sheath 1) of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern
    + nls1-1D plants also exhibited constitutively activated defense responses, including extensive cell death, excess hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, up-regulated expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens
