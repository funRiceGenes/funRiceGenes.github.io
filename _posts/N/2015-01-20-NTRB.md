2. __chloroplast__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR
3. __shoot__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
4. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
