* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The NRP1 showed significantly negative correlation with the expression of many genes involved in photosynthesis
    + Knocking out NPR1 led to greater photosynthesis and increased biomass in the field, while overexpression of NRP1 decreased photosynthesis and biomass
    + Protein transactivation experiments show that NRP1 is a transcription activator, implying that NRP1 may indirectly regulate photosynthesis gene expression through an unknown regulator
