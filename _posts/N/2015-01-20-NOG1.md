    + NOG1 increases grain production in rice.
    + NOG1 can significantly increase the grain yield of commercial high-yield varieties: introduction of NOG1 increases the grain yield by 25
    + 8% in the NOG1-deficient rice cultivar Zhonghua 17, and overexpression of NOG1 can further increase the grain yield by 19
    + Interestingly, NOG1 plays a prominent role in increasing grain number, but does not change heading date or seed-setting rate
    + The grain yield regulator NOG1 plays a dual role in latitudinal adaptation and cold tolerance during rice domestication.
    + Previously we isolated the domestication-related gene NOG1 which affects rice grain number and yield
    + Additionally, we observed NOG1 influences the chilling tolerance of rice
    + Through genome-wide transcriptional analysis after cold treatment at 10Â°C, there were 717 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nog1 near-isogenic lines compared with the control Guichao 2, including 432 up-regulated DEGs and 284 down-regulated DEGs
