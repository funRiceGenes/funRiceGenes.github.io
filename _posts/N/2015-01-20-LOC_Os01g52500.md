* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited
    + These results indicate that rice NADP-ME2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses
    + These results suggest that NADP-ME2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress
    + Expression of NADP-ME2 mRNA in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3, NaCl, and environmental pH changes
