## Connection
1. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE NOL as the most closely related protein to NYC1
2. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i
3. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation
4. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro
5. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice
6. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D),  Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL for NYC1-like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro
7. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D),  We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions
