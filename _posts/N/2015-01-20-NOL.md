* **Information**  
    + Symbol: NOL  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g45194](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g45194)

* **Publication**  
    + [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2009, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AB255026](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB255026)

* **Key message**  
    + These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice.
