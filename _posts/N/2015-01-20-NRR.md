## Key message
1. __disease resistance__, [Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1%5BTitle%5D), Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1
2. __ xoo __, [Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1%5BTitle%5D),  This phenotype was correlated with elevated NRR mRNA and protein levels and increased Xoo growth
3. __disease__, [Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1%5BTitle%5D), Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1
4. __defense__, ["Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1"%5BTitle%5D), " Over-expression of NRR suppressed the induction of defense-related genes
5. __defense__, ["Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1"%5BTitle%5D),  NRR:GFP (green fluorescent protein) protein was localized to the nucleus, indicating that NRR may act directly to suppress the activation of defense genes"
6. __growth__, [Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1%5BTitle%5D),  This phenotype was correlated with elevated NRR mRNA and protein levels and increased Xoo growth
