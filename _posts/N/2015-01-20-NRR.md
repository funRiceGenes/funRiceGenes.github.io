* **Key message**  
    + Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1
    + This phenotype was correlated with elevated NRR mRNA and protein levels and increased Xoo growth
    + Over-expression of NRR suppressed the induction of defense-related genes
    + NRR:GFP (green fluorescent protein) protein was localized to the nucleus, indicating that NRR may act directly to suppress the activation of defense genes
