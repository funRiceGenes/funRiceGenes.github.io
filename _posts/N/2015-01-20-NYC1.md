## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  Ultrastructural analysis of nyc1 chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes
2. __chloroplast__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning of NYC1 revealed that it encodes a chloroplast-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) with three transmembrane domains
3. __leaf__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence
