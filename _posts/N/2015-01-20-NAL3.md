1. __spikelet__, [The rice narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3 loci encode WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (OsWOX3A) and function in leaf, spikelet, tiller and lateral root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3 loci encode WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (OsWOX3A) and function in leaf, spikelet, tiller and lateral root development%5BTitle%5D)),  In order to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice (Oryza sativa) organ development, we studied the narrow leaf2 narrow leaf3 (nal2 nal3; hereafter nal2/3) double mutant, which produces narrow-curly leaves, more tillers, fewer lateral roots, opened spikelets and narrow-thin grains
2. __leaf__, [Two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3, control leaf width in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3, control leaf width in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The narrow-leaf phenotype of FL90 shows a two-factor recessive inheritance and is caused by the loss of function of two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, NAL2 and NAL3 (NAL2/3), which are duplicate genes orthologous to maize NS1 and NS2 and to Arabidopsis PRS
