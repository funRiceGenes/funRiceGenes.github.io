* **Key message**  
    + Two mutants ny1 (LOC_Os07g32406) and ny2 (LOC_Os07g32040) were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in neo-tetraploid rice, and which exhibited low pollen fertility and abnormal chromosome behavior
    + An uncharacterized protein NY1 targets EAT1 to regulate anther tapetum development in polyploid rice.
    + RESULTS: Here, cytological observations of the NY1 mutant (ny1) indicated that ny1 exhibited abnormal tapetum and middle layer development
    + The mutant of EAT1 was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 that showed abnormal tapetum and pollen wall formation, which was similar to ny1
