## Key message
1. __nitrogen__, [A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the chlorophyll content that could be a marker of nitrogen utilization was found to be decreased in NIGT1 overexpressors of rice grown with nitrate medium but not with ammonium medium
2. __nitrogen__, [A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, we propose NIGT1 as a nitrate-inducible and autorepressible transcriptional repressor that may play a role in the nitrogen response in rice
3. __nitrate__, [A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the supply of nitrate but not ammonium immediately induces the expression of a transcriptional repressor gene in rice, designated NIGT1 Nitrate-Inducible, GARP-type Transcriptional Repressor 1)  
4. __nitrate__, [A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Consistently, nitrate-induced NIGT1 expression was found to be down-regulated after a transient peak during nitrate treatment, and the nitrate-induced expression of NIGT1 decreased in transgenic rice plants in which this gene was constitutively overexpressed
5. __nitrate__, [A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the chlorophyll content that could be a marker of nitrogen utilization was found to be decreased in NIGT1 overexpressors of rice grown with nitrate medium but not with ammonium medium
