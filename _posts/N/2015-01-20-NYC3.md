* **Key message**  
    + The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr
    + nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild-type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non-functional stay-green mutant
