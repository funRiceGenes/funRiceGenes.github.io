* **Key message**  
    + NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex directly activates Wx to regulate grain quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + NF-YC12 and bHLH144 maintain NF-YB1 stability from the degradation mediated by ubiquitin/26S proteasome, while NF-YB1 directly binds to the 'G-box' domain of Wx promoter and activates Wx transcription, hence to regulate rice grain quality.
    + Knockout of NF-YC12 significantly decreased grain weight as well as altering starch and protein accumulation and starch granule formation.
    + This study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving NF-YC12, which coordinates multiple pathways to regulate endosperm development and the accumulation of storage substances in rice seeds.
