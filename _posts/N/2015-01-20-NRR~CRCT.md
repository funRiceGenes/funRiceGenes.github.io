* **Key message**  
    + We report here the expression and biological functions of a previously uncharacterized rice gene that we have named NRR (nutrition response and root growth)
    + Expression of NRR in rice seedling roots was significantly influenced by deficiency of macronutrients
    + Knock-down of expression of NRRa or NRRb by RNA interference resulted in enhanced rice root growth
    + By contrast, overexpression of NRRa in rice exhibited significantly retarded root growth
    + These results revealed that both NRRa and NRRb played negative regulatory roles in rice root growth
    + Our findings suggest that NRRa and NRRb, acting as the key components, modulate the rice root architecture with the availability of macronutrients
    + A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth
    + Promoter GUS analysis showed that CRCT was highly expressed in the phloem of various tissues such as leaf blade and leaf sheath
    + Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression
    + CO2 Responsive CCT protein, CRCT Is a Positive Regulator of Starch Synthesis in Vegetative Organs of Rice.
    + The expressions of several genes related to starch synthesis such as ADP-glucose pyrophospholylase and α-glucan phospholylase were significantly changed in transgenic lines and positively correlated with the expression levels of CRCT
    + Given these observations, we suggest that CRCT is a positive regulator of starch accumulation in vegetative tissues, regulating coordinated expression of starch synthesis genes in response to the levels of photoassimilates
    + The expression of CRCT showed diurnal oscillation peaked at the end of light period and was also increased by sugars such as glucose and sucrose
    + In this study, we analyzed the effects of the starch level in the leaf sheath on the photosynthetic rate in leaf blade using CRCT overexpression and RNAi knockdown transgenic rice grown under ambient (38 Pa) or elevated (100 Pa) CO2 conditions
    + In leaf sheath, the starch content was markedly changed in relation to CRCT expression levels under both CO2 conditions
