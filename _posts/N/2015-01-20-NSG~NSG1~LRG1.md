* **Key message**  
    + nsg (nonstop glumes) mutant affecting spikelet development was identified from EMS-treated Jinhui10 (Oryza sativa L
    + The mutant phenotype suggests that NSG is involved in the whole rice spikelet development
    + The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
    + The mutation of NSG influenced the transcription level of some floral hometic genes
    + NSG1 encoded a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and was expressed mainly in the organ primordia of the spikelet
    + The results suggest that NSG1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of LHS1, DL, MFO1
    + LRG1 maintains sterile lemma identity by regulating OsMADS6 expression in rice
