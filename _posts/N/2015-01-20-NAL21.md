* **Key message**  
    + Microscopic observation revealed defects in the vascular system and reduced epidermal cell size and number in the nal21 leaf blade
    + Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs
    + The nal21 mutant showed aberrant auxin responses in which multiple auxin response factors (ARFs) harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) were repressed at the translational level
    + Ribosome-targeting antibiotics resistance assay and ribosome profiling showed a significant reduction in the free 40S ribosome subunit in the nal21 mutant
    + Map-based cloning revealed that NAL21 encodes a ribosomal small subunit protein RPS3A
