## Key message
1. __ sa __, [Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, because the morphology and constitutive defense responses of nls1-1D were not suppressed by blocking SA or NPR1 transcript accumulation, we suggest that NLS1 mediates both SA and NPR1-independent defense signaling pathways in rice
2. __sheath__, [Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we characterized the semi-dominant mutant nls1-1D necrotic leaf sheath 1 of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern
3. __leaf__, [Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we characterized the semi-dominant mutant nls1-1D necrotic leaf sheath 1 of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern
