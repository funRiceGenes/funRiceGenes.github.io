## Key message
1. __seed__, [Cloning and expression of a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The uxs gene was expressed in mature, harvested rice seeds as well as in immature seeds 14 d post-anthesis, suggesting that the uxs gene is necessary at the beginning of the germination period
