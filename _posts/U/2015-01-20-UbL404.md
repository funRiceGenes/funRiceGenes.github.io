* **Key message**  
    + Among the UbL40 family members, UbL404 may have a major role in the regulation of thermosensitive genic male sterility since the expression level of UbL404 was much higher than that of UbL401 and UbL402, consistent with the RNA-seq data in NIL5 and NIL8, and RT¨CPCR data in AnS-1 (Figs 4a,b and 5d; Supplementary Figs 10, 12, 13 and 15)
