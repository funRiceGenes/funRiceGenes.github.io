* **Key message**  
    + Our findings suggest that UGT85E1 plays an important role in mediating plant response to drought and oxidative stresses
    + Rice Glycosyltransferase Gene UGT85E1 Is Involved in Drought Stress Tolerance Through Enhancing Abscisic Acid Response.
    + UGT85E1 gene is significantly upregulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + The overexpression of UGT85E1 led to an enhanced tolerance in transgenic rice plants to drought stress, while the ugt85e1 mutants of rice showed a more sensitive phenotype to drought stress
    + Further studies indicated that UGT85E1 overexpression induced ABA accumulation, stomatal closure, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, increased proline and sugar contents, and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress conditions
    + Moreover, when UGT85E1 was ectopically overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the transgenic plants showed increased tolerance to drought as well as in rice
    + In this study, we reported the characterization of a putative glycosyltransferase gene UGT85E1 in rice
