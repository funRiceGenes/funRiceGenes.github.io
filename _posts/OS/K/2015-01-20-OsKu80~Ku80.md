## Expression information
__Expression__:  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: RNAi-mediated knock-down T3 transgenic rice plants Ubi:RNAi-OsKu80 displayed a retarded growth phenotype at the post-germination stage |  In addition, the Ubi:RNAi-OsKu80 knock-down progeny exhibited noticeably increased telomere length as compared to wild-type rice

## Connection
1. __OsKu80~Ku80__, __OsLig4~Lig4__, [Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Rice calli from OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 knockdown KD plants were infected with Agrobacterium harboring a sensitive emerald luciferase LUC reporter construct to evaluate stable expression and a green fluorescent protein GFP construct to monitor transient expression of T-DNA
2. __OsKu80~Ku80__, __OsLig4~Lig4__, [Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, suppression of OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 induced the expression of HR-related genes on treatment with DNA-damaging agents
3. __OsKu70__, __OsKu80~Ku80__, [Suppression of OsKu80 results in defects in developmental growth and increased telomere length in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Suppression of OsKu80 results in defects in developmental growth and increased telomere length in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  OsKu80 forms a heterodimer with OsKu70 in yeast and plant cells, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays
