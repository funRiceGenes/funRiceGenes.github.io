* **Key message**  
    + Here we report the characterization of two inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in guard cell of rice plants
    + While OsKAT2 showed typical potassium channel activity, like that of Arabidopsis KAT1, OsKAT3 did not despite high sequence similarity between the two channel proteins
    + Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells
