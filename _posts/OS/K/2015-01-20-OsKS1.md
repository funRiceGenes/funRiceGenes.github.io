* **Key message**  
    + The osks1 mutant seedlings were responsive to exogenous gibberellin (GA3)
    + 3 kb were detected in leaves and stem of wild-type plants, but not in germinating seeds or roots, suggesting that OsKS1 is not involved in germination or root growth
    + Expression of OsKS1, one of the genes encoding for GA biosynthetic enzymes, was suppressed in the antisense transgenic lines
    + The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant
    + As mutations in three recently reported rice GA-responsive dwarf mutant alleles and the dwarf mutation identified in this study mapped to the same locus, we designate the corresponding gene OsKS1
