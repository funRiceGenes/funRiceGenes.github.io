* **Key message**  
    + The downregulation of OsKEAP1 increased the levels of H2O2, malondialdehyde, and proline while significantly decreasing the expression of two catalase genes in seedlings grown under normal and salt-stressed conditions
    + The oskeap1 mutations greatly impaired plant growth and development, resulting in significant declines in a majority of agronomic and yield-related traits, i
    + In silico analysis showed that OsKEAP1 has a Kelch-repeat domain which is identical to those of animals and a plant-specific development and cell death (DCD) domain in place of the broad-complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac (BTB) domain found in animals
    + OsKEAP1 was proven to be localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, in contrast to the exclusive cytoplasm localization of animal KEAP1
