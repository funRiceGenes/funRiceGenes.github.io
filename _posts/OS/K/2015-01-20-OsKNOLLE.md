## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress%5BTitle%5D)), " The transformants with OsKNOLLE showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+
2. __abiotic stress__, [Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>OsKNOLLE</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress%5BTitle%5D)),  These data suggests that OsKNOLLE plays a crucial role in re-sponses to abiotic stresses
