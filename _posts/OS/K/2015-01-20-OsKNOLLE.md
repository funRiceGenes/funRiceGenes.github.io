* **Key message**  
    + The transformants with OsKNOLLE showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+
    + These data suggests that OsKNOLLE plays a crucial role in re-sponses to abiotic stresses
    + This experimental system sets up a method for studying functions of the OsKNOLLE gene in the future and clarifies the relationship between OsKNOLLE and abiotic stresses
