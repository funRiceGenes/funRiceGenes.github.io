    + __OsKOS1~OsKOL4~CYP701A8~qST-6.2__, __OsKOS2~OsKOL5__, [A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu D35, encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu D35, encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase%5BTitle%5D), OsKOL4 and OsKOL5 are likely to take part in phytoalexin biosynthesis, because their expression was promoted by UV irradiation and/or elicitor treatment
