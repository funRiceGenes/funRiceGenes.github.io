* **Publication**  
    + [Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), 2014, J Integr Plant Biol.

* **Key message**  
    + We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
    + Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa
    + Overexpression of OsKTN80a caused the retarded root growth of rice seedlings
