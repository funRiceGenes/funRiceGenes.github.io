## Key message
1. __potassium__, [Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the characterization of two inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in guard cell of rice plants
2. __potassium__, [Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells%5BTitle%5D)),  While OsKAT2 showed typical potassium channel activity, like that of Arabidopsis KAT1, OsKAT3 did not despite high sequence similarity between the two channel proteins
3. __potassium__, [Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, the two potassium channels physically interacted with each other and such interaction negatively regulated the OsKAT2 channel activity in CHO cell system
