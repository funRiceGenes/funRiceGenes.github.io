* **Key message**  
    + Introduction of OsKOL4 into d35Tan-Ginbozu did not rescue its dwarf phenotype, indicating that OsKOL4 is not involved in GA biosynthesis
    + In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids
    + Thus, it appears that OsKOL4 plays a role in the more specialized diterpenoid metabolism of rice, and our results provide evidence for divergence of a KO/CYP701 family member from GA biosynthesis
    + Gibberellin responsiveness study and quantitative real-time PCR showed a faulty gibberellin pathway and epistatic control between the genes such as OsKOL4 and OsBRD2 causing semi-dwarfism in a mutant

    + __OsKOS1~OsKOL4~CYP701A8__, __OsKOS2~OsKOL5__, [A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu D35, encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu D35, encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase%5BTitle%5D), Expression analysis revealed that OsKOL2 and OsKOL4 were actively transcribed in various organs, while OsKOL1 and OsKOL5 were expressed only at low levels; OsKOL3 may be a pseudogene
    + __OsKOS1~OsKOL4~CYP701A8__, __OsKOS2~OsKOL5__, [A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu D35, encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu D35, encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase%5BTitle%5D), OsKOL4 and OsKOL5 are likely to take part in phytoalexin biosynthesis, because their expression was promoted by UV irradiation and/or elicitor treatment
