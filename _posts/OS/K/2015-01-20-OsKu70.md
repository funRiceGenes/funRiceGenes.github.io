* **Key message**  
    + In contrast to what was observed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) atku70 mutants, homozygous G2 osku70 rice plants displayed severe developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive organs under normal growth conditions, resulting in sterile flowers
    + These results suggest that OsKu70 is required for the maintenance of chromosome stability and normal developmental growth in rice plants
    + OsKu70 is associated with developmental growth and genome stability in rice
