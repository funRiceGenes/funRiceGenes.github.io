## Key message
1. __potassium__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)), Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells
2. __growth__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  By the expression of OsKAT1, the K(+) contents of salt-stressed G19 cells increased during the exponential growth phase
3. __salt stress__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+)
4. __homeostasis__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+)
5. __salinity stress__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)), Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells
6. __salt__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)), " We found that expression of a cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Shaker family K(+) channel KAT1 (OsKAT1), suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19 (Deltaena1-4), which lacks a major component of Na(+) efflux

9. __salt__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These functions of OsKAT1 are likely to be common among Shaker K(+) channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as OsKAT1
10. __salt__, [Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+)"
