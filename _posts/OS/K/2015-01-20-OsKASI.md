* **Key message**  
    + The involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is found to play a critical role in root development of rice
    + Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice
    + Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative 3-oxoacyl-synthase, an ortholog of β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI) in Arabidopsis, thus designated as OsKASI
    + In addition, OsKASI deficiency resulted in reduced fertility and a remarkable change in fatty acid (FA) composition and contents in roots and seeds
