* **Key message**  
    + Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions
    + Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (OS-ERS1 and OS-ETR2)
    + Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice
    + Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species
    + Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice
    + Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and OsETR2 could have different roles during rice plant submergence
    + The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.
    + OsERS1 and OsETR2 are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions
    + Base on the results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas OsETR2 could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum
