* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Our GUS expression data from developing seeds and those that were germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone layer
