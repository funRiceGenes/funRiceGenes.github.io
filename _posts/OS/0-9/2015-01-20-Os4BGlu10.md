* **Key message**  
    + Morphological, physiological, and gene expression analyses showed that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 played specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance of rice, with various relations with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Î²-Glucosidases (BGlus) belong to glycoside hydrolase family 1 and have many functions in plants.
