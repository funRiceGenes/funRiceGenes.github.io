* **Key message**  
    + Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
    + A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
