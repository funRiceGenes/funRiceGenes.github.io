* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that xa13, a recessive allele conferring disease resistance against bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, plays a key role in both disease resistance and pollen development
    + The dominant allele, Xa13, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development
    + The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1
    + Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice
    + The recessive gene, xa13, confers resistance to Philippine race 6 (PXO99) of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae
    + Genetic and physical mapping of xa13 , a recessive bacterial blight resistance gene in rice
    + These markers will be useful tools for the marker-assisted selection of xa13 in breeding programs
    + The recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13, also involved in pollen development, has been cloned and its resistance mechanism has been recently characterized
    + This report describes the conversion of bacterial blight resistance mediated by the recessive xa13 gene into a dominant trait to facilitate its use in a breeding program
    + Gene silencing using the recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13 as a new paradigm in plant breeding
    + To clone and characterize the recessive R genes, we fine-mapped xa13, a fully recessive gene for Xoo resistance, to a DNA fragment of 14
    + Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3
    + Targeting xa13, a recessive gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice
    + Tissue-specific promoters were used to exclude most of the expression of artificial microRNA in the anther to ensure that Xa13 functioned normally during pollen development
    + Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, xa13, and Xa21) and gene pyramids
    + Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen
    + PXO99 causes rice disease by inducing Xa13
    + The recessive xa13 allele represents a new type of plant disease resistance
    + Essential Role of Sugar Transporter OsSWEET11 during the Early Stage of Rice Grain Filling.
    + The knockout of OsSWEET11 significantly decreased sucrose concentration in the mutant embryo-sacs and led to defective grain filling compared with that of the wild-type (WT) plant
    + This study investigated the role of sugar transporter OsSWEET11 during the early stage of rice caryopsis development using the ¦Â-glucoronidase (GUS)-represented expression, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, cross-fertilization, and RNA-seq analyses
    + These results strongly suggested that OsSWEET11 played an important role in sucrose release from maternal tissue to the maternal-filial interface during the early stage of caryopsis development
