* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that xa13, a recessive allele conferring disease resistance against bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, plays a key role in both disease resistance and pollen development
    + The dominant allele, Xa13, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development
    + The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1
    + Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice
    + The recessive gene, xa13, confers resistance to Philippine race 6 (PXO99) of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae
    + Genetic and physical mapping of xa13 , a recessive bacterial blight resistance gene in rice
    + These markers will be useful tools for the marker-assisted selection of xa13 in breeding programs
    + The recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13, also involved in pollen development, has been cloned and its resistance mechanism has been recently characterized
    + This report describes the conversion of bacterial blight resistance mediated by the recessive xa13 gene into a dominant trait to facilitate its use in a breeding program
    + Gene silencing using the recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13 as a new paradigm in plant breeding
    + To clone and characterize the recessive R genes, we fine-mapped xa13, a fully recessive gene for Xoo resistance, to a DNA fragment of 14
    + Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3
    + Targeting xa13, a recessive gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice
    + Tissue-specific promoters were used to exclude most of the expression of artificial microRNA in the anther to ensure that Xa13 functioned normally during pollen development
    + Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, xa13, and Xa21) and gene pyramids
    + Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen
    + PXO99 causes rice disease by inducing Xa13
    + The recessive xa13 allele represents a new type of plant disease resistance
    + Essential Role of Sugar Transporter OsSWEET11 during the Early Stage of Rice Grain Filling.
    + The knockout of OsSWEET11 significantly decreased sucrose concentration in the mutant embryo-sacs and led to defective grain filling compared with that of the wild-type (WT) plant
    + This study investigated the role of sugar transporter OsSWEET11 during the early stage of rice caryopsis development using the β-glucoronidase (GUS)-represented expression, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, cross-fertilization, and RNA-seq analyses
    + These results strongly suggested that OsSWEET11 played an important role in sucrose release from maternal tissue to the maternal-filial interface during the early stage of caryopsis development
    + Inhibition of OsSWEET11 function in mesophyll cells improves resistance of rice to sheath blight disease.
    + In this study, we found that the rice sugar transporter, OsSWEET11 is involved in the pathogenesis of sheath blight disease
    + The analyses of transgenic plants revealed that Ossweet11 mutants were less susceptible, whereas plants overexpressing OsSWEET11 were more susceptible to sheath blight compared to wild-type controls, but the yield of OsSWEET11 mutants and overexpressors was reduced
    + To analyze whether inhibition of OsSWEET11 function in mesophyll cells is related to defense against this disease, mutated- OsSWEET11 was expressed under the control of Rubisco promoter, which is specific for green tissues
    + The plants can be protected from infection by manipulating the expression of OsSWEET11 without affecting the crop yield
    + solani might acquire sugar from rice leaves by activating OsSWEET11 expression
    + CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of Os8N3 in rice to confer resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + It has previously been reported that, in rice plants, knockdown of the Os8N3 gene resulted in enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Analysis of the genotypes and edited Os8N3 in T0, T1, T2, and T3 transgenic rice plants showed that the mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations, and homozygous mutants displayed significantly enhanced resistance to Xoo
