* **Key message**  
    + A knowledge-based molecular screen uncovers a broad spectrum OsSWEET14 resistance allele to bacterial blight from wild rice.
    + We show that this allele, which we call xa41(t), confers resistance against half of the tested Xoo strains representative of various geographic origins and genetic lineages, highlighting the selective pressure for the pathogen to accommodate with OsSWEET14 polymorphism and reciprocally the apparent limited possibilities for the host to create variability at this particular S gene
    + In a proof-of-principle experiment, we screened a germplasm of 169 rice accessions for polymorphism in the promoter of the major bacterial blight susceptibility (S) gene OsSWEET14 which encodes a sugar transporter targeted by numerous strains of X
    + Surprisingly, although indels within TalC EBE prevented OsSWEET14 induction in response to BAI3 wild-type bacteria relying on TalC, loss of TalC-responsiveness failed to confer resistance to this strain
    + Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + Moreover, the expression of OsSWEET14 was detected in vascular tissues, including the stem, leaf sheath, leaf blade and root
    + CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation of OsSWEET14 in rice cv. Zhonghua11 confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae without yield penalty
    + Conclusions: Disruption of OsSWEET14 in the Zhonghua 11 background is able to confer strong resistance to African Xoo strain AXO1947 and Asian Xoo strain PXO86
    + The disruption of OsSWEET14 led to increased plant height without a reduction in yield
    + The genetic background and increased plant height need to be taken into consideration when utilizing OsSWEET14 for resistant rice breeding
    + However, the OsSWEET14 single knockout or promoter mutants in the Kitaake background are moderately resistant or even susceptible to African Xoo strains
