* **Key message**  
    + Suppression of Os4CL3 expression resulted in significant lignin reduction, shorter plant growth, and other morphological changes
    + Further, the loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 notably reduced cell-wall-bound ferulates, indicating their roles in cell wall feruloylation
    + A series of chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that loss-of-function of Os4CL3 and Os4CL4 differently altered the composition of lignin polymer units
    + Loss of function of Os4CL3 induced marked reductions in the major guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units derived from both the conserved non-γ-p-coumaroylated and the grass-specific γ-p-coumaroylated monolignols, with more prominent reductions in guaiacyl units than in syringyl units
    + DNA methylation variation of lignin synthesis-related OsSWN1, OsMYBX9, OsPAL1 and Os4CL3 mediated their expression level differnece and affected the ratio of cellulose to lignin content
