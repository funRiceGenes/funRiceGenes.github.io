## Connection
1. __Os-eIF6;1__, __Os-eIF6;2__, [Characterization of plant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) genes: The essential role in embryogenesis and their differential expression in Arabidopsis and rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of plant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) genes: The essential role in embryogenesis and their differential expression in Arabidopsis and rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Although a single gene encodes eIF6 in yeast and animals, two genes were found to encode proteins homologous to animal and yeast eIF6 in Arabidopsis and rice, denoted At-eIF6;1 and At-eIF6;2, and Os-eIF6;1 and Os-eIF6;2, respectively
2. __Os-eIF6;1__, __Os-eIF6;2__, [Characterization of plant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) genes: The essential role in embryogenesis and their differential expression in Arabidopsis and rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of plant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) genes: The essential role in embryogenesis and their differential expression in Arabidopsis and rice%5BTitle%5D)),  On the other hand, both Os-eIF6;1 and Os-eIF6;2 are probably active genes because they are expressed at significant expression levels
