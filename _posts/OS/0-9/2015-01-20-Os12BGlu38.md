    + Rice Î²-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.
    + Histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that mutant pollen lacked intine cell wall, which was rescued by introduction of WT Os12BGlu38 genomic DNA
    + Os12BGlu38 fused with green fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane (PM) in rice and tobacco
