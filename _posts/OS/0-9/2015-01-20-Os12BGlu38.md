* **Key message**  
    + Rice 尾-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.
    + Histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that mutant pollen lacked intine cell wall, which was rescued by introduction of WT Os12BGlu38 genomic DNA
    + Os12BGlu38 fused with green fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane (PM) in rice and tobacco
    + Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility

* **Connection**  
    + __AMD1~PWA1__, __Os12BGlu38__, [POLLEN WALL ABORTION 1 is essential for pollen wall development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POLLEN WALL ABORTION 1 is essential for pollen wall development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Further studies suggested that PWA1 has transcriptional activation activity and participates in pollen intine development through the 尾-glucosidase Os12BGlu38
