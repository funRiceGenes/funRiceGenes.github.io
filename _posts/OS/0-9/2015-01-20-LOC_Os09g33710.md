* **Key message**  
    + Specific roles of Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance in rice.
    + Morphological, physiological, and gene expression analyses showed that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 played specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance of rice, with various relations with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling
    + Taken together, we demonstrate that Os4BGlu10, Os6BGlu24, and Os9BGlu33 play specific roles in seed germination, root elongation, and drought tolerance with various relation with IAA and ABA signaling
    + 25<U+00A0>Î¼M IAA, and Os9BGlu33 was up-regulated by PEG, IAA, and ABA
