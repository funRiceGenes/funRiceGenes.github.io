* **Key message**  
    + Os3BGlu6 was responsive to drought and ABA treatments, and the protein was localized to the chloroplast
    + Transcriptomics revealed that disruption of Os3BGlu6 resulted in chloroplastic oxidative stress and lowered Rubisco activity even under normal condition
    + Chloroplastic Os3BGlu6 contributes significantly to cellular ABA pools and impacts drought tolerance and photosynthesis in rice.
    + Drought induced Os3BGlu6 to form dimmers, and the degree of polymerization correlated well with the increase in cellular ABA levels and drought tolerance in rice
    + Taken together, these results suggest that chloroplastically localized Os3BGlu6 significantly affects cellular ABA pools, thereby affecting drought tolerance and photosynthesis in rice
    + Disruption of Os3BGlu6 in rice r esulted in dwarfism, lower ABA content in leaves, drought-sensitivity, lower photosynthesis rate, and higher intercellular CO2 concentration
    + Os3BGlu6 could hydrolyze ABA-GE to ABA in vitro
    + Disruption of Os3BGlu6 resulted in the increased stomatal density and impaired stomatal movement

* **Connection**  
    + __Os3BGlu6__, __STK__, [Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase STK Confers Salt Tolerance in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase STK Confers Salt Tolerance in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) suggested that four stress-related genes may be regulated by STK including OsABAR1, Os3BGlu6, OSBZ8 and OsSIK1
