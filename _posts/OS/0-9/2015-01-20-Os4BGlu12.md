* **Key message**  
    + Os4BGlu12 expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli hydrolyzed β-(1,3;1,4)-glucooligosaccharides generated by the wounding-induced rice endo-(1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase OsEGL1, suggesting that both enzymes may act in concert in remodeling of damaged cell wall
    + The amino acid residues predicted to line the active site of Os4BGlu12 are more similar to those of cyanogenic and flavonoid β-glucosidases than oligosaccharide hydrolases, and it may function in defense, as well as in cell wall-derived oligosaccharide break-down
    + Rice Os4BGlu12 is a wound-induced β-glucosidase that hydrolyzes cell wall-β-glucan-derived oligosaccharides and glycosides
    + Rice Os4BGlu12 β-glucosidase is a family 1 glycoside hydrolase, the transcript levels of which have previously been found to be induced in response to herbivore attack and salinity stress
    + Here, high levels of Os4bglu12 transcripts were also detected in the shoot during germination, in the leaf sheath and stem of mature rice plants under normal growth conditions
    + The cDNA of the Os4bglu12 gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the N-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by RT-PCR from rice seedlings
    + To begin this analysis, Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism
    + Native Os4BGlu12 and its complex with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DNP2FG) were crystallized using 19% polyethylene glycol (3350 or 2000, respectively) in 0
