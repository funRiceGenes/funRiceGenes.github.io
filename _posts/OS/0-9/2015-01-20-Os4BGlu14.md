* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Compared to the wild type, rice lines overexpressing Os4BGlu14 had significantly greater grain length, but smaller grain width and thickness
    + Our study provides a basis for understanding the function of Os4BGlu14 in seed longevity in rice
