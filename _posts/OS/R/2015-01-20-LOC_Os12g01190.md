    + __OsRINGC2-1__, __OsRINGC2-2__, [Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D), We isolated two rice genes harboring the RING-C2 domain on the distal parts of rice chromosomes 11 and 12, termed OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2, respectively
    + __OsRINGC2-1__, __OsRINGC2-2__, [Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D), A comparison of sequence divergences between 10 duplicate pairs on the distal parts of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and randomly selected duplicate pairs suggested that OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2 have evolved in concert via gene conversion
