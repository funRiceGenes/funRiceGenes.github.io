* **Key message**  
    + The rice RING E3 ligase, OsCTR1, inhibits trafficking to the chloroplasts of OsCP12 and OsRP1, and its overexpression confers drought tolerance in Arabidopsis
    + Interestingly, two chloroplast-localized proteins (OsCP12 and OsRP1) interacted with OsCTR1 in the cytosol, and ubiquitination by OsCTR1 led to protein degradation via the Ub 26S proteasome
