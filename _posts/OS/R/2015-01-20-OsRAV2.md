* **Key message**  
    + Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.
    + Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment
    + Serial 5' deletions and site-specific mutations in P OsRAV2 revealed that a GT-1 element located at position -664 relative to the putative translation start site is essential for the salt induction of P OsRAV2
    + The regulatory function of the GT-1 element in the salt induction of OsRAV2 was verified in situ in plants with targeted mutations generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system
    + Taken together, our results indicate that the GT-1 element directly controls the salt response of OsRAV2
    + Further expression profile analyses indicated that OsRAV2 is transcriptionally regulated by salt, but not KCl, osmotic stress, cold or ABA (abscisic acid) treatment
    + To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the stress response at the transcriptional level, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of OsRAV2 (P OsRAV2 )
