## Key message
1. __flower__, [OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsRRMh dsRNAi lines exhibited late-flowering and a larger panicle phenotype
2. __flower__, [OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Also, overexpression of OsRRMh in the Arabidopsis fpa mutant did not restore the normal flowering time, and it delayed flowering in Col plants
3. __seed__, [OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The gene has been found to be constitutively expressed in the root, stem, leaf, spikelet, and immature seed, and alternative splicing patterns were confirmed in different tissues, which may indicate diverse functions for OsRRMh
4. __vegetative__, [OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, we propose that OsRRMh may confer one of its functions in the vegetative-to-reproductive transition in rice (Oryza sativa L
5. __vegetative__, [OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice
