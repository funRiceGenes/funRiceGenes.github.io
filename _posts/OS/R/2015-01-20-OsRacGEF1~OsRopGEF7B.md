* **Key message**  
    + Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection
    + Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    + OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER
    + In chitin signaling in rice, two direct substrates of OsCERK1, Rac/ROP GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsRacGEF1 and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185, have been identified as components of the OsCERK1 complex and are rapidly phosphorylated by OsCERK1 in response to chitin
    + Knock-out and -down of OsRopGEF7B by T-DNA insertion and RNA interference, respectively, predominantly caused an increase in the number of floral organs in the inner whorls (stamen and ovary), as well as abnormal paleae/lemmas and ectopic growth of lodicules, resulting in decline of rice seed setting
    + OsRopGEF7B plays roles in floral organ development in rice, affecting rice seed setting rate
    + OsRopGEF7Bpro:GUS analysis indicates that OsRopGEF7B is expressed in various tissues, especially in the floral meristem and floral organ primordia
