* **Key message**  
    + OsRLR4 binds to the OsAUX1 promoter to negatively regulate primary root development in rice.
    + Here, the two loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants of root length regulator 4 (OsRLR4), osrlr4-1 and osrlr4-2 with longer PR, and three OsRLR4 overexpression lines, OE-OsRLR4-1/-2/-3 with shorter PR compared to the wild type, Hwayoung (WT/HY), were identified
    + OsRLR4 controls PR development by regulating auxin accumulation in the PR tip and thus the root apical meristem activity
    + A series of biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that OsRLR4 functions directly upstream of the auxin transporter OsAUX1
    + Phylogenetic analysis of OsRLR4 from wild and cultivated rice indicated that it is under selective sweeps, suggesting its potential role in domestication
