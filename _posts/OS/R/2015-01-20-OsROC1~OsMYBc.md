* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsHKT1;1 has a role in controlling Na(+) concentration and preventing sodium toxicity in leaf blades and is regulated by the OsMYBc transcription factor
    + Knockout of OsMYBc resulted in a reduction in NaCl-induced expression of OsHKT1;1 and salt sensitivity
