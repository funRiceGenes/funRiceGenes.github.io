* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, a number of genes involved in plant development, stress response, transcriptional regulation, and particularly ABA signaling are differentially expressed in osrbohB plants under both normal growth and drought conditions
    + The osrbohB mutant also exhibits lower seed germination rate, organ size and thousand seed weight, but higher stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought
    + We found that a rice NADPH oxidase gene OsRbohB contributes drought tolerance and its functions are involved in the interaction of the OsRbohB-mediated ROS production and ABA signaling
    + All these results suggest the roles of OsRbohB in drought tolerance of rice, which probably performed through the interaction of the OsRbohB-mediated ROS production and ABA signaling
    + The transcriptional expression of OsRbohB is also strongly stimulated by dehydration, salt and several phytohormonal treatments
    + Overproduction of OsRACK1A restores the OsRACK1A-OsRBOHB association and promotes OsRBOHB phosphorylation to enhance ROS production, conferring rice floral resistance to U
