    + Rice lectin protein Osr40c1 imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins
    + In this study, it has been depicted that expression of Osr40c1 gene correlates with the drought tolerance potential of various rice cultivars
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing Osr40c1 were significantly more tolerant to drought stress over the wild-type plants
    + Silencing of each of these protein partners led to drought sensitivity in the otherwise tolerant Osr40c1 expressing transgenic tobacco lines indicating that these partners were crucial for the Osr40c1-mediated drought tolerance in planta
    + Moreover, the association of Osr40c1 with these partners occurred specifically under drought stress forming a multi-protein complex
    + Together, the present investigation delineated the novel role of Osr40c1 protein in imparting drought tolerance by regulating OsMNB1B, OsSAM2, and OsH4 proteins, which presumably enables OsSAP8 to induce downstream gene expression
