## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells%5BTitle%5D)),  We conclude that OsRab5a plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice

7. __seed__, [OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance
