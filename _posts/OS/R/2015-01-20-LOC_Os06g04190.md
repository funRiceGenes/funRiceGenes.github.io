    + [The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.%5BTitle%5D), 2016, Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis
    + The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.
    + Here, we characterized a RAD1 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa) and obtained evidence that OsRAD1 is important for meiotic DSB repair

* **Connection**  
    + __OsHUS1__, __OsRAD1__, [The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.%5BTitle%5D), In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis
    + __OsRAD1__, __OsRAD17__, [OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.%5BTitle%5D),  OsRAD17 interacts with OsRAD1 and the meiotic phenotype of Osrad1 Osrad17 is indistinguishable from the two single mutants which have similar phenotypes, manifesting they could act in the same pathway
    + __OsRAD1__, __OsRAD17__, [OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.%5BTitle%5D),  Similar phenotypes were observed in the Osmsh5 Osrad17 and Osmer3 Osrad1 double mutants, suggesting the cooperation between the checkpoint proteins and ZMM proteins in assuring accurate HR in rice
