## Connection
1. __OsrbcL1__, __OsRBCS1__, [Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.%5BTitle%5D), In this study, our findings regarding the regulation of GA irradiation-induced OsGIRP1 in relation to the levels of photosynthesis-related proteins such as OsrbcL1 and OsrbcS1 and hypersensitive responses of overexpressing plants to GR irradiation provide insight into the molecular functions of OsGIRP1 as a negative regulator in response to the stress of radiation
2. __OsrbcL1__, __OsRBCS1__, [Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.%5BTitle%5D),  Protein degradation in cell extracts showed that OsGIRP1 mediates proteolysis of 2 substrates, OsrbcS1 and OsrbcL1, via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway
