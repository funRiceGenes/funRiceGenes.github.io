* **Key message**  
    + Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
    + BML is a candidate gene associated with leaf senescence, ROS regulation, and disease response, also involved in hormone signaling in rice
    + The bml mutant showed excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and malondialdehyde, upregulation of senescence-induced STAY-GREEN genes and senescence-related transcription factors, and down regulation of photosynthesis-related genes
    + The bml mutants had brown midribs in their leaves and initiated senescence prematurely, at the onset of heading
    + In pathogen response, bml demonstrated higher resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + A map-based cloning using insertion/deletion markers confirmed that BML was located in the 57
    + The levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) were increased in bml with the upregulation of some ABA and JA biosynthetic genes
