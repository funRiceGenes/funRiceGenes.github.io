    + Overexpression of OsRRK1 Changes Leaf Morphology and Defense to Insect in Rice.
    + These results indicated that OsRRK1 may play multiple roles in the development and defense of rice, which may facilitate the breeding of novel rice varieties
    + Overexpression of OsRRK1 (OE-OsRRK1) caused adaxial rolling and erect morphology of rice leaves
