    + OsRap2.6 transcription factor contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with Receptor for Activated Kinase-C 1 (RACK1)
    + An ERF transcription factor OsERF101 is predominantly expressed in rice reproductive tissues and plays an important role in improving rice seed setting rate under drought stress
    + OsERF101 was predominantly expressed in flowers, particularly in the tapetum and microspores under normal growth conditions
    + In this study, we identified a gene named OsERF101 as an important positive regulator in the adaptive responses to dehydration stress during the reproductive and vegetative stages
    + Taken together, our results indicate that OsERF101 is a gene that regulates dehydration responses during the vegetative and reproductive stages
    + Compared with wild type, the oserf101 T-DNA knockout mutant showed delayed leaf yellowing and higher chlorophyll contents during DIS and natural senescence
    + After methyl jasmonate treatment to induce rapid leaf de-greening, the oserf101 leaves retained more chlorophyll compared with wild type, indicating that OsERF101 is involved in promoting jasmonic acid (JA)-induced leaf senescence
    + Transient transactivation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsERF101 directly binds to the promoter regions of OsNAP and OsMYC2, which activate genes involved in chlorophyll degradation and JA signaling-mediated leaf senescence
    + These results demonstrate that OsERF101 promotes the onset and progression of leaf senescence through a JA-mediated signaling pathway
    + OsERF101 encodes a predicted transcription factor and OsERF101 transcript levels rapidly increased in rice leaves during dark-induced senescence (DIS), indicating that OsERF101 is a senescence-associated transcription factor
    + Consistent with the involvement of JA, the expression of the JA signaling genes OsMYC2/JA INSENSITIVE 1 (OsJAI1) and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1a (OsCOI1a), was downregulated in the oserf101 leaves during DIS
    + The rice OsERF101 transcription factor regulates the NLR Xa1-mediated immunity induced by perception of TAL effectors.
    + Unexpectedly, both the overexpression and the knockout lines of OsERF101 displayed Xa1-dependent, enhanced resistance to an incompatible Xoo strain
    + Xa1 interacts in the nucleus with the TAL effectors and OsERF101 via the BED domain
    + Our results indicate that OsERF101 regulates the recognition of TAL effectors by Xa1, and functions as a positive regulator of Xa1-mediated immunity
