## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice%5BTitle%5D),  In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions
2. __leaf__, [Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice%5BTitle%5D),  Hence it is suggested that OsRab7B3 act as a stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in the leaf senescence process
3. __leaf__, [Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice
4. __ ABA __, [Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of sGFP under the control of the OsRab7B3 promoter increased in leaves when ABA and NaCl were applied or when kept in dark
5. __senescence__, [Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice%5BTitle%5D),  One of the OsRab genes, OsRab7B3, closely associated with senescence in expression pattern, was chosen for functional analysis
6. __senescence__, [Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice%5BTitle%5D),  In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions
