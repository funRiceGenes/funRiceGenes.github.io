* **Key message**  
    + In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions
    + Hence it is suggested that OsRab7B3 act as a stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in the leaf senescence process
    + Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice
    + Expression of sGFP under the control of the OsRab7B3 promoter increased in leaves when ABA and NaCl were applied or when kept in dark
    + One of the OsRab genes, OsRab7B3, closely associated with senescence in expression pattern, was chosen for functional analysis
    + OsRab7 overexpression also increased grain yield in rice
    + Taken together, the current study indicates that the OsRab7 gene improves grain yield and enhances drought and heat tolerance in transgenic rice by modulating osmolytes, antioxidants and abiotic stress-responsive genes expression
    + Therefore, OsRab7 gene could be exploited as a promising candidate for improving rice grain yield and stress tolerance
