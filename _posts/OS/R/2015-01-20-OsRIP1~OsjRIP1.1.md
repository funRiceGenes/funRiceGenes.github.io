* **Key message**  
    + The data obtained in this research indicate that OsRIP1 can play a role in plant defense against herbivorous insects
    + OsRIP1 inactivated insect ribosomes in vitro, suggesting that its toxicity relates to the enzymatic activity of OsRIP1
    + Furthermore, recombinant OsRIP1 was toxic for brown planthoppers when administered through liquid artificial diet
    + Over-expression of OsRIP1 in transgenic rice plants did not affect the performance of insects reared on these plants, most likely due to insufficient concentrations of OsRIP1 in the phloem
    + OsRIP1 provoked HeLa cells to undergo caspase-independent cell death, associated with a significant transcriptional upregulation of the apoptotic gene PUMA, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the autophagy-related marker LC3
    + Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of OsRIP1 for 24-72â€¯h OsRIP1 treatment yielded an anti-proliferation response of the HeLa cells and resulted in apoptotic-like blebbing of the plasma membrane without causing DNA fragmentation
