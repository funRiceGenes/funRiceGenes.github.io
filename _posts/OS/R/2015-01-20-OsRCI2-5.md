## Key message
1. __resistance__, [Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare
2. __flower__, [Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  Gene expression profiling showed that the OsRCI2-5 gene was expressed in the rice leaves, stems, and flower organs
3. __drought__, [Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare
4. __drought resistance__, [Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare
