* **Key message**  
    + These observations suggest that OsRad21-4 is essential for efficient meiosis
    + The rice OsRad21-4, an orthologue of yeast Rec8 protein, is required for efficient meiosis
    + Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments on Osrec8 meiocytes demonstrated that the mutation eliminated meiotic centromeric cohesion completely during prophase I and also led to the bipolar orientation of the kinetochores during the first meiotic division and accordingly resulted in premature separation of sister chromatid during meiosis I
    + OsREC8 is essential for chromatid cohesion and metaphase I monopolar orientation in rice meiosis
    + We showed that OsREC8 encodes a protein that localized to meiotic chromosomes from approximately meiotic interphase to metaphase I
    + These results suggest that OsREC8 has several essential roles in the meiotic processes
    + Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
    + Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8
    + Meiotic chromosome behaviors were monitored from male meiocytes of OsRAD21-4-deficient lines mediated by RNAi
    + Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
    + Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
