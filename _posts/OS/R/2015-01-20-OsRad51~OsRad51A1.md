* **Key message**  
    + cDNA corresponding to OsRad51 protein was isolated from cDNA library of rice flowers (Oryza sativa, Indica cultivar group) and cloned in to pET28a expression vector

* **Connection**  
    + __OsNAPL6__, __OsRad51~OsRad51A1__, [A NAP-family histone chaperone acts in abiotic stress response and adaptation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A NAP-family histone chaperone acts in abiotic stress response and adaptation.%5BTitle%5D), For instance, we show that OsNAPL6 is recruited to OsRad51 promoter activating its expression, leading to a more efficient DNA repair and abrogation of programmed cell death under salinity and genotoxic stress conditions
