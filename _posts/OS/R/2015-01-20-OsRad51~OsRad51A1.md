* **Key message**  
    + cDNA corresponding to OsRad51 protein was isolated from cDNA library of rice flowers (Oryza sativa, Indica cultivar group) and cloned in to pET28a expression vector
    + These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination
    + In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1
