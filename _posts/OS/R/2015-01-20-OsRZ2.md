* **Key message**  
    + OsRZ2 complemented the cold sensitivity of BX04 Escherichia coli cells under low temperatures, and had DNA-melting activity and transcription anti-termination activity, thereby indicating that OsRZ2 possesses an RNA chaperone activity
    + Ectopic expression of OsRZ2, but not OsRZ3, in cold-sensitive Arabidopsis grp7 knockout plants rescued the grp7 plants from cold and freezing damage, and OsRZ2 complemented the defect in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in grp7 mutant during cold stress
