* **Key message**  
    + We characterized the functions of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 in plant growth and development in rice using both for-ward and reverse genetics methods
    + OsRBR2 was preferentially expressed in stamens and promoted pollen formation
    + Mutation of OsRBR2 led to deformed anthers without pollen
    + These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
    + Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2
