    + OsRAM2 function in lipid biosynthesis is required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice
    + Examining their expression patterns during symbiosis revealed that only OsRAM2 was strongly upregulated upon AMF inoculation
    + truncatula RAM2, and found that plants defective in OsRAM2 were unable to be colonized by AM fungi and showed impaired colonization by Magnaporthe oryzae
    + Collectively, our data show that the function and regulation of OsRAM2 is conserved in monocot and dicot plants and reveals that, similar to mutualistic fungi, pathogenic fungi have recruited RAM2-mediated fatty acid biosynthesis to facilitate invasion
