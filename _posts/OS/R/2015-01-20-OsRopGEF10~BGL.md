## Key message
1. __leaf__, [The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D),  In the paddy field, the bright green leaf bgl mutants of rice Oryza sativa exhibit a luminous green color that is clearly distinguishable from the normal green of wild-type plants
2. __leaf__, [The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D),  Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that small cuticular papillae or small papillae; SP), nipple-like structures, are absent on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of bgl mutants, leading to more direct reflection and less diffusion of green light

4. __sheath__, [The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D),  In agreement with the timing of SP initiation on the leaf epidermis, OsRopGEF10 is most strongly expressed in newly developing leaves before emergence from the leaf sheath

## Connection
1. __OsRac1__, __OsRopGEF10~BGL__, [The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D),  In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsRopGEF10 interacts with OsRac1, one of seven OsRac proteins; consistent with this, both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane
2. __OsRac1__, __OsRopGEF10~BGL__, [The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice bright green leaf bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsRopGEF10 activates OsRac1 to turn on the molecular signaling pathway for SP development
