* **Key message**  
    + In our work, OsRHP1 was expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, but its transcript is accumulated more in mature leaf
    + Compared with wild-type (WT) rice plants, transgenic plants overexpressing OsRHP1 exhibited more tolerance to drought and salt stress
    + These results demonstrate that overexpression of OsRHP1 substantially enhances drought and salt tolerance through increased ABA level and enhanced ABA-mediated stress response
