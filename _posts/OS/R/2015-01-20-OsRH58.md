* **Key message**  
    + Chloroplast localization of OsRH58 was confirmed by analyzing the expression of OsRH58-GFP fusion proteins in tobacco leaves
    + These findings suggest that the chloroplast-transported OsRH58 possessing RNA chaperone activity confers stress tolerance by increasing translation of chloroplast mRNAs
    + In this study, rice OsRH58 (LOC_Os01g73900), a chloroplast-localized DEAD-box RH, was characterized for its expression patterns upon stress treatment and its functional roles using transgenic Arabidopsis plants under normal and abiotic stress conditions
    + Expression of OsRH58 in rice was up-regulated by salt, drought, or heat stress, whereas its expression was decreased by cold, UV, or ABA treatment
