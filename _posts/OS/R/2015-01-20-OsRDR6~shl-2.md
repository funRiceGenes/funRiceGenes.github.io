* **Key message**  
    + We isolated a rice osrdr6-1 mutant, which was temperature sensitive and showed spikelet defects
    + In three independent transgenic lines (OsRDR6AS line A, B and C) in which OsRDR6 transcription levels were reduced by 70-80% through antisense silencing, the infection and disease symptoms of RSV were shown to be significantly enhanced
    + The hypersusceptibilities of the OsRDR6AS plants were attributed not to enhanced insect infestation but to enhanced virus infection
    + We propose that ABA modulates PTGS through the transcriptional control of the OsRDR6 gene
    + OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.

* **Connection**  
    + __OsRDR6~shl-2__, __OsSGS3__, [p2 of rice stripe virus RSV interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=p2 of rice stripe virus RSV interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor%5BTitle%5D), SGS3 has been shown to be involved in sense transgene-induced RNA silencing and in the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), possibly functioning as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)
