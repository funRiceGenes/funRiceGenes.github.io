* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + In our current study, we characterized the response of a rice osrar1 T-DNA insertion mutant to infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease
    + OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races
    + These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance
    + OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance
