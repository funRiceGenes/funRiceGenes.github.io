## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Characterization of four RecQ homologues from rice Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of four RecQ homologues from rice Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare%5BTitle%5D),  OsRecQ1, OsRecQ886, and OsRecQsim expressions were strongly detected in meristematic tissues

## Connection
1. __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, these RNAs were completely abolished in OsRecQ1 RecQ DNA helicase homologue and OsRDR1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue mutant lines where either gene was disrupted by the insertion of rice retrotransposon Tos17 after the same treatment
2. __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results strongly suggest that both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 play a pivotal role in the aRNA and qiRNA biogenesis required for the DDR and repair pathway in rice, and it may be a novel mechanism of regulation to the DDR through the production of qiRNA in plants
3. __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D), Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice
