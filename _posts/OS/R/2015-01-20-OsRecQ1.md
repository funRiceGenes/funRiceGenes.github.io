* **Key message**  
    + OsRecQ1, OsRecQ886, and OsRecQsim expressions were strongly detected in meristematic tissues

    + __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D), Together, these results strongly suggest that both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 play a pivotal role in the aRNA and qiRNA biogenesis required for the DDR and repair pathway in rice, and it may be a novel mechanism of regulation to the DDR through the production of qiRNA in plants
