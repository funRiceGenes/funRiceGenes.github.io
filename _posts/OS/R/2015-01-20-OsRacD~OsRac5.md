## Key message
1. __sterility__, [Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D),  Evidence from RT-PCR study indicates that osRACD gene is related to photoperiod fertility conversion of photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) rice
2. __fertility__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D), OsRac5 belongs to the rice Rho of plants family, and acts as the molecular switch in the signal pathway which is pivotally involved in the rice fertility control
3. __growth__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development
4. __panicle__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D),  Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
5. __fertility__, [Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene%5BTitle%5D), The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L
6. __sterile__, [Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structural analysis and identification of cis-elements of rice osRACD gene%5BTitle%5D), The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L
7. __panicle__, [Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D),  By screening cDNA library of the rice Nongken 58N panicle using the newly obtained fragment RDP-8 as probe, we further found the full-length cDNA of osRACD gene that encodes a rice small GTP-binding protein
8. __fertility__, [Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of osRACD gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice%5BTitle%5D),  Evidence from RT-PCR study indicates that osRACD gene is related to photoperiod fertility conversion of photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) rice

## Connection
1. __OsMY1__, __OsRacD~OsRac5__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D),  By yeast two-hybrid assay, it is confirmed that OsMY1 binds both the wild type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) OsRac5, but does not interact with dominantly negative OsRac5
2. __OsMY1__, __OsRacD~OsRac5__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, the interactions between OsMY1 and WT-OsRac5 or CA-OsRac5 in vivo are demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay
3. __OsMY1__, __OsRacD~OsRac5__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D),  Using PCR-mediated sequence deletion and point mutation of OsMY1, the interaction between OsMY1 and OsRac5 was identified to be mediated by the coiled-coil domain in OsMY1, and their binding was quantified by O-nitro-phenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside assay
4. __OsMY1__, __OsRacD~OsRac5__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D),  Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
