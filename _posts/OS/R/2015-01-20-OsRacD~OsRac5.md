* **Key message**  
    + Evidence from RT-PCR study indicates that osRACD gene is related to photoperiod fertility conversion of photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) rice
    + OsRac5 belongs to the rice Rho of plants family, and acts as the molecular switch in the signal pathway which is pivotally involved in the rice fertility control
    + Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development
    + Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
    + The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L
    + By screening cDNA library of the rice Nongken 58N panicle using the newly obtained fragment RDP-8 as probe, we further found the full-length cDNA of osRACD gene that encodes a rice small GTP-binding protein

    + __OsMY1__, __OsRacD~OsRac5__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D), By yeast two-hybrid assay, it is confirmed that OsMY1 binds both the wild type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) OsRac5, but does not interact with dominantly negative OsRac5
