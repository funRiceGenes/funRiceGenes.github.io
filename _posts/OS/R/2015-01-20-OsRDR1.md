* **Key message**  
    + Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression
    + We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection

    + __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D), However, these RNAs were completely abolished in OsRecQ1 (RecQ DNA helicase homologue) and OsRDR1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue) mutant lines where either gene was disrupted by the insertion of rice retrotransposon Tos17 after the same treatment
    + __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D), Together, these results strongly suggest that both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 play a pivotal role in the aRNA and qiRNA biogenesis required for the DDR and repair pathway in rice, and it may be a novel mechanism of regulation to the DDR through the production of qiRNA in plants

    + __OsMADS57__, __OsRDR1__, [A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.%5BTitle%5D), Consequently, increased level of miR444 diminishes the repressive roles of OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57 on OsRDR1 transcription thus to activate OsRDR1-dependent antiviral RNA silencing pathway
    + __OsMADS57__, __OsRDR1__, [A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.%5BTitle%5D), We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
