## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Here, we show that a monocot-specific miRNA, miR444, is a key factor to relay the antiviral signaling from virus infection to OsRDR1 expression |  Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression |  We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKCC-type MADS-box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter |  We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection  
__OverExpression__: Expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) and overexpression of miR444 improves rice resistance against RSV infection accompanied by upregulation of OsRDR1 expression |  We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection

## Connection
1. __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, these RNAs were completely abolished in OsRecQ1 (RecQ DNA helicase homologue) and OsRDR1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue) mutant lines where either gene was disrupted by the insertion of rice retrotransposon Tos17 after the same treatment
2. __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results strongly suggest that both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 play a pivotal role in the aRNA and qiRNA biogenesis required for the DDR and repair pathway in rice, and it may be a novel mechanism of regulation to the DDR through the production of qiRNA in plants
3. __OsRDR1__, __OsRecQ1__, [Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice%5BTitle%5D), Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 Are Required for the Production of Small RNA in Response to DNA-Damage in Rice
4. __OsMADS57__, __OsRDR1__, [A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.%5BTitle%5D),  We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKCC-type MADS-box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter

6. __OsMADS57__, __OsRDR1__, [A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A signaling cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in rice antiviral RNA silencing pathway.%5BTitle%5D),  We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection
