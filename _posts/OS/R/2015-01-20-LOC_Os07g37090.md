* **Key message**  
    + Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants
    + Our data suggested that the increased tolerance to these abiotic stresses in transgenic plants might be due to up-regulation of some stress-dependent/independent genes and OSRIP18 may be potentially useful in further improving plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses by over-expression
