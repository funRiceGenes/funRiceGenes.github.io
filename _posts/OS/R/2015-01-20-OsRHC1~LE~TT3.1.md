* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + tomato DC3000, suggesting that OsRHC1 may confer broad-spectrum disease resistance
    + Using map-based cloning, we mapped the LE gene to the short arm of chromosome 3
    + The LE encodes a C3HC4-type RING finger protein and was expressed to relatively high levels in seeds at a late developmental stage
    + A genetic module at one locus in rice protects chloroplasts to enhance thermotolerance
