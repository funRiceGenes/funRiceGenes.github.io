    + RESULTS: The OsRPK1 gene, which encodes a Ca(2+)-independent Ser/Thr kinase, was predominantly expressed in root tips, leaf blades, and undifferentiated suspension cells, and was markedly induced by treatment with auxin or ABA
    + OsRPK1 over-expression also inhibited the expression of most auxin efflux carrier OsPIN genes, which was accompanied by changes in PAT and endogenous free IAA distribution in the leaves and roots
    + CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase, affects the root system architecture by negatively regulating polar auxin transport in rice
    + OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, negatively regulates polar auxin transport and root development in rice
    + Overexpression of the receptor-like protein kinase genes AtRPK1 and OsRPK1 reduces the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana
    + Using immuno-histochemical techniques, we determined that the expression of OsRPK1 was localized in the plasma membrane of cortex cells in roots
    + Knockdown of OsRPK1 promoted the growth of transgenic rice plants, and increased plant height and tiller numbers
    + Immuno-blots indicated that OsRPK1 is also induced by cold, drought, and abscisic acid
    + We previously identified a novel LRR-RLK in rice roots, and named it OsRPK1
    + In addition, a new leucine-rich-repeat type receptor-like protein kinase, OsRPK1, was identified as a salt-responding protein
    + METHODS: In this study, we first detected OsRPK1 kinase activity in vitro, and assessed its expression profile
