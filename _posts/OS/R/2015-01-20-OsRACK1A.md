## Connection
1. __OsRac1__, __OsRACK1A__, [Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment
2. __OsRACK1A__, __OsRAR1__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance
3. __OsRac1__, __OsRACK1A__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1
4. __OsRac1__, __OsRACK1A__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels
5. __OsRac1__, __OsRACK1A__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex
6. __OsRACK1A__, __RACK1B~OsWD40-122__, [RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1
