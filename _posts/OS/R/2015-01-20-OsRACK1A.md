* **Key message**  
    + OsRACK1A was found to follow a rhythmic expression profile under circadian conditions at both the transcription and the translation levels, although the expression was arrhythmic under salt stress
    + Analysis of plant survival rates, fresh weight, proline content, malondialdehyde, and chlorophyll showed that suppression of OsRACK1A enhanced tolerance to salt stress
    + We identified putative interactors of OsRACK1A, and found that OsRACK1A interacted with many salt stress-responsive proteins directly
    + These results suggest that OsRACK1A is regulated by circadian rhythm, and involved in the regulation of salt stress responses
    + Although the analysis of natural variation revealed no OsRACK1A variants that could avoid being targeted by UvCBP1, expression levels of OsRACK1A are correlated with field resistance against U
    + Overproduction of OsRACK1A restores the OsRACK1A-OsRBOHB association and promotes OsRBOHB phosphorylation to enhance ROS production, conferring rice floral resistance to U
    + Mechanistically, UvCBP1 interacts with the rice scaffold protein OsRACK1A and competes its interaction with the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase OsRBOHB, leading to inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
