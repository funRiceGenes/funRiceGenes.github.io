* **Key message**  
    + A novel blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger protein gene OsRING-1 was cloned from rice by cDNA library screening
    + Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
    + The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region
    + Taken together, OsRING-1, as a novel C3H2C3-type zinc finger protein involved in many stress responses in rice might plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant stress response signal transduction pathways
    + Northern analysis showed that OsRING-1 was induced in different degree by pathogen infections, SA, ABA, JA and ethephon (ET) treatments
    + In contrast, RNAi-mediated OsATL38 knockdown transgenic progeny exhibited markedly increased tolerance to cold stress relative to that of wild-type plants, which indicated a negative role of OsATL38 in response to cold stress
    + OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice
    + These results suggested that the RING E3 Ub ligase OsATL38 negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice via mono-ubiquitination of OsGF14d 14-3-3 protein
    + In this study, OsATL38 was identified as a low temperature-induced gene that encodes a rice homolog of Arabidopsis T¨®xicos en Levadura RING-type E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, which was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane
