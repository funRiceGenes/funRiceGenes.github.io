* **Key message**  
    + The MSI1 member OsRBAP1 gene, identiﬁed by a modiﬁed MutMap method, is required for rice height and spikelet fertility.
    + Altogether, our results suggest that OsRBAP1 plays an important role in the regulation of rice height and spikelet fertility
    + The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to switch off OsRBAP1 in PTWT to obtain the knockout mutant osrbap1, which exhibited a severe reduction in height and fertility
    + MutMap-based cloning revealed the occurrence of a single amino acid substitution in the LOC_Os01g51300 gene, belonging to the MSI1 (multicopy suppressor of IRA1) member OsRBAP1
