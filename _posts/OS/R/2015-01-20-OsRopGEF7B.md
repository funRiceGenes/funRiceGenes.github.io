* **Key message**  
    + Knock-out and -down of OsRopGEF7B by T-DNA insertion and RNA interference, respectively, predominantly caused an increase in the number of floral organs in the inner whorls (stamen and ovary), as well as abnormal paleae/lemmas and ectopic growth of lodicules, resulting in decline of rice seed setting
    + OsRopGEF7B plays roles in floral organ development in rice, affecting rice seed setting rate
    + OsRopGEF7Bpro:GUS analysis indicates that OsRopGEF7B is expressed in various tissues, especially in the floral meristem and floral organ primordia
