* **Key message**  
    + Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent
