## Key message
1. __cell cycle__, [Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice Oryza sativa L. and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice Oryza sativa L. and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex%5BTitle%5D),  Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent
2. __shoot apical meristem__, [Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice Oryza sativa L. and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice Oryza sativa L. and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex%5BTitle%5D),  Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent
