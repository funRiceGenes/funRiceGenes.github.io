* **Key message**  
    + Here, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical rice type-A response regulators, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are both induced by cytokinin and repressed by salinity stress in rice
    + Together, these results suggest that OsRR9 and OsRR10 function as negative regulators in rice salinity tolerance
    + In addition, disruption of OsRR9 and OsRR10 also affects the expression of multiple genes related to photosynthesis, transcription activity, and phytohormone signaling
