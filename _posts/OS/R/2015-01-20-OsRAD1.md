* **Key message**  
    + In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis
    + The endonuclease homolog OsRAD1 promotes accurate meiotic double-strand break repair by suppressing non-homologous end joining.
    + Here, we characterized a RAD1 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa) and obtained evidence that OsRAD1 is important for meiotic DSB repair
