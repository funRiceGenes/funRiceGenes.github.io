* **Key message**  
    + OsRAF is an ethylene responsive and root abundant factor gene of rice
    + Here, we report OsRAF (a Root Abundant Factor gene in Oryza sativa), a new member of the rice ERF group, expressed more abundantly in roots than in other organs of rice at the transcriptional level
    + OsLG3 contributing to rice grain length and yield was mined by Ho-LAMap.
    + Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsLG3 might have much potential value for improvement of grain length in japonica breeding
    + The results demonstrated that Ho-LAMap is a potential approach for gene discovery and OsLG3 is a promising gene to be utilized in genomic assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement
