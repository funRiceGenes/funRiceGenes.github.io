* **Key message**  
    + OsRAF is an ethylene responsive and root abundant factor gene of rice
    + Here, we report OsRAF (a Root Abundant Factor gene in Oryza sativa), a new member of the rice ERF group, expressed more abundantly in roots than in other organs of rice at the transcriptional level
    + OsLG3 contributing to rice grain length and yield was mined by Ho-LAMap.
    + Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsLG3 might have much potential value for improvement of grain length in japonica breeding
    + The results demonstrated that Ho-LAMap is a potential approach for gene discovery and OsLG3 is a promising gene to be utilized in genomic assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement
    + Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates drought tolerance in rice
    + In our previous work, we found that OsLG3 has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality
    + Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in OsLG3 contributes to rice drought tolerance and that the elite allele of OsLG3 is a promising genetic resource for the development of drought-tolerant rice varieties
    + Natural Variation in OsLG3 Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging.
    + Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of OsLG3 may improve drought tolerance in cultivated japonica rice
    + Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of OsLG3IRAT109 showed increased drought tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in OsLG3 contributes to drought tolerance in rice
    + By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of OsLG3 is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds
    + Overexpression of OsLG3 significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated drought, whereas suppression of OsLG3 resulted in greater susceptibility
    + Further investigation suggested that OsLG3 plays a positive role in drought-stress tolerance in rice by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging
