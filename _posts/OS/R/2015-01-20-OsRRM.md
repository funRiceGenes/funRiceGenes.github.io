## Key message
1. __growth__, [OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic expression of OsRRM in transgenic plants led to abnormalities, such as short stature, retarded growth and low fructification rates
2. __endosperm__, [OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsRRM promoter directed GUS expression specifically in rice endosperm, analogous to the GUS expression pattern observed in 107#
3. __endosperm__, [OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Western blot analysis confirmed that the OsRRM protein was specifically expressed in rice endosperm
4. __endosperm__, [OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Our data, in conjunction with the reported function of Spen genes, implicated OsRRM in the regulation of cell development in rice endosperm
5. __endosperm__, [OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm%5BTitle%5D)), OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm
