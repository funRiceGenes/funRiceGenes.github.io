* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic expression of OsRRM in transgenic plants led to abnormalities, such as short stature, retarded growth and low fructification rates
    + The OsRRM promoter directed GUS expression specifically in rice endosperm, analogous to the GUS expression pattern observed in 107#
    + Western blot analysis confirmed that the OsRRM protein was specifically expressed in rice endosperm
    + Our data, in conjunction with the reported function of Spen genes, implicated OsRRM in the regulation of cell development in rice endosperm
    + OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm
