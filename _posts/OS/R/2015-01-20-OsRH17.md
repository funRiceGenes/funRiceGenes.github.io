* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsRH17 was specifically expressed in pollen and differentiated callus and upregulated by application of the plant hormones naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) and abscisic acid (ABA)
    + No visible phenotype was observed in transgenic yeast and rice (overexpressing OsRH17, N-427, and C-167, as well as OsRH17 knockdown), and even in some abiotic and biotic stresses, which could be due to the redundancy in rice under normal conditions
