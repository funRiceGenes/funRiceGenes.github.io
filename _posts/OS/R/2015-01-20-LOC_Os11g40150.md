* **Key message**  
    + cDNA corresponding to OsRad51 protein was isolated from cDNA library of rice flowers (Oryza sativa, Indica cultivar group) and cloned in to pET28a expression vector
    + These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination
    + In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1
    + Osrad51 (Osrad51a1 Osrad51a2) mutant plants show normal vegetative growth but exhibit complete sterility, indicating that OsRAD51A1 and OsRAD51A2 are functionally redundant in rice fertility
    + Moreover, univalents and multivalent associations were observed at metaphase I, chromosome fragments presented at anaphase I, and crossover formation is basically suppressed in Osrad51 pollen mother cells (PMCs)
    + In the homologous recombination pathway, the detailed mechanisms of how OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 work in rice meiosis remain to be explored
    + In addition, both OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 can interact with OsFIGL1 and OsBRCA2, two important components in rice meiosis
    + OsRAD51 Plays a Vital Role in Promoting Homologous Recombination in Rice Meiosis.
    + Genome evolution analysis of representative rice germplasms suggested that numbers of GCG sequence repeats in the first exon of COLD11 were subjected to strong domestication selection during the northern expansion of rice planting
    + Rice loss-of-function mutations of COLD11 caused reduced chilling tolerance
    + Natural variation of codon repeats in COLD11 endows rice with chilling resilience.
