* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We found by immunoprecipitation that OsPP2A B, OsPP2A catalytic subunit subtype II, PSTAIRE-type CDK and OsRBR1 were in the same protein complex, indicating a physical association between the phosphatase, the kinase and their common substrate
