* **Key message**  
    + Silencing of OsRLCK102 compromised receptor kinase XA21-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Plants with silenced OsRLCK102 exhibit architecture alterations, including reduced plant height, enlarged angle of the lamina joint, decreased rates of seed setting and enhanced sensitivity to hormone brassinolide (BR)
    + The Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase OsRLCK102 Regulates XA21-Mediated Immunity and Plant Development in Rice
    + Collectively, our study reveals that OsRLCK102 positively regulates XA21-mediated immunity and negatively regulates rice development through BR signaling in rice
