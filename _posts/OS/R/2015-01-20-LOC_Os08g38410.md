* **Key message**  
    + OsRBGD3 overexpression also attributed to significant root development and early flowering in transgenics
    + Hence, OsRBGD3 could be an important target for developing cold tolerant early flowering rice and other crops' genotypes for increasing production in low temperature affected areas
    + OsRBGD3 exhibited cold, drought and salt stress inductive expression in a drought tolerant N22 rice cultivar as compared with susceptible variety IR64
    + Constitutive overexpression of the OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold stress
    + Heterologous expression of rice RNA-binding glycine-rich (RBG) gene OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana confers cold stress tolerance.
