* **Key message**  
    + Analysis of water loss and leaf temperature under stress conditions revealed a higher evaporation rate and cooling effect in OsRZFP34-overexpressing Arabidopsis and rice than the wild type, atrzfp34 and osrzfp34
    + Thus, stomata opening, enhanced leaf cooling, and ABA insensitivity was conserved with OsRZFP34 expression
    + As compared with the wild type, rice and Arabidopsis with OsRZFP34 overexpression showed increased relative stomata opening even with ABA treatment
    + Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing OsRZFP34 revealed many genes involved in OsRZFP34-mediated stomatal movement
    + Furthermore, loss-of-function mutation of OsRZFP34 and AtRZFP34 (At5g22920), an OsRZFP34 homolog in Arabidopsis, decreased relative stomata aperture under nonstress control conditions
    + We suggest that OsRZFP34 may modulate these genes to control stomata opening

* **Connection**  
    + __OsPUB67__, __OsRZFP34__, [A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D), OsPUB67, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, may interact with two drought tolerance negative regulators (OsRZFP34 and OsDIS1) and improve drought tolerance by enhancing the reactive oxygen scavenging ability and stomatal closure
    + __OsPUB67__, __OsRZFP34__, [A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Further evidence showed that several E3 ubiquitin ligases interacted with OsPUB67, especially OsRZFP34 and OsDIS1, which are negative regulators of drought tolerance
