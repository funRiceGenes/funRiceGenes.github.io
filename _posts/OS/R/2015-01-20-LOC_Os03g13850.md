* **Key message**  
    + In Osrad17 pollen mother cells (PMCs), associations between non-homologous chromosomes and chromosome fragmentation were constantly observed
    + OsRAD17 Is Required for Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair and Plays a Redundant Role With OsZIP4 in Synaptonemal Complex Assembly.
    + OsRAD17 interacts with OsRAD1 and the meiotic phenotype of Osrad1 Osrad17 is indistinguishable from the two single mutants which have similar phenotypes, manifesting they could act in the same pathway
