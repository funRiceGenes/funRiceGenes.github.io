* **Key message**  
    + Further RNA in situ hybridization analysis and promoter::beta-glucuronidase staining indicated that OsRAD21-2 was mainly expressed in actively dividing tissues including premeiotic stamen, stem intercalary meristem, leaf meristem, and root pericycle
    + Ectopic expression of OsRAD21-2 in fission yeast resulted in cell growth delay and morphological abnormality
    + Our results suggest that OsRad21-2 functions in regulation of cell division and growth
    + Rice OsRAD21-2 is expressed in actively dividing tissues and its ectopic expression in yeast results in aberrant cell division and growth
    + Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed OsRAD21-2 preferentially expressed in premeiotic flowers
