* **Key message**  
    + Suppression of OsRAD51D results in defects in reproductive development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Overall, these results suggest that OsRAD51D plays a critical role in reproductive growth in rice.
    + The osrad51d and Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D plants contained longer telomeres compared with wild type plants, indicating that OsRAD51D is a negative factor for telomere lengthening.
    + Homozygous osrad51d mutant flowers exhibited impaired development of lemma and palea and contained unusual numbers of stamens and stigmas.
    + During early meiosis, osrad51d pollen mother cells (PMCs) failed to form normal homologous chromosome pairings
    + Here, through detailed analyses of Osrad51d single and double mutants, we pinpoint the specific function of OsRAD51D in coordinating homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions during meiosis
    + Moreover, the interplay between OsRAD51D and OsRAD51C indicates both conservation and divergence of their functions in meiosis
    + Altogether, this work reveals that OsRAD51D plays an essential role in the inhibition of non-homologous connections, thus guaranteeing faithful pairing and recombination during meiosis
    + OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing nonhomologous interactions in rice meiosis
    + Here, through detailed analyses of Osrad51d single and double mutants, we pinpoint the specific function of OsRAD51D in coordinating homologous pairing and recombination by preventing nonhomologous interactions during meiosis
    + Altogether, this work reveals that OsRAD51D plays an essential role in the inhibition of nonhomologous connections, thus guaranteeing faithful pairing and recombination during meiosis
    + The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of homologous recombination
