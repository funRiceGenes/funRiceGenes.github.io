* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress
    + Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
    + The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling
    + Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling

* **Connection**  
    + __OsRR3__, __OsRR6__, [Biochemical and molecular characterisation of exogenous cytokinin application on grain filling in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Biochemical and molecular characterisation of exogenous cytokinin application on grain filling in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Expression studies of type-A response regulator (RR) component of cytokinin signaling indicated possible role of OsRR3, OsRR4 and OsRR6 as repressors of CKX expression, much needed for an increased accumulation of CK in cells
