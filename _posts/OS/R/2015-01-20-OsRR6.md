* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress
    + Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles
    + The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling
    + Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling
    + The hypocotyl growth in OsRR6OX seedlings was significantly inhibited under red, far-red and blue-light conditions and also a decline in transcript levels of OsRR6 was observed in rice under the above monochromatic as well as white light treatments
    + Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the genes associated with phenylpropanoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis are enriched among differentially expressed genes in OsRR6OX seedlings of Arabidopsis, which is in conformity with reanalysis of the transcriptome data performed in rice transgenics for OsRR6
    + The Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing OsRR6 (OsRR6OX) exhibited reduced cytokinin sensitivity, adventitious root formation and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in seeds
    + The expression of OsRR6 is induced by exogenous cytokinin and various abiotic stress treatments, including drought, cold and salinity stress
