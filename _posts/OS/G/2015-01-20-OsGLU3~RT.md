* **Key message**  
    + Here, we further showed that OsGLU3 is also dispensable for nitrogen starvation induced root elongation in rice
    + Osglu3-1 displayed less crystalline cellulose content in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, and a slightly smaller root meristem as visualized by restricted expression of OsCYCB1,1:GUS
    + The fully functional OsGLU3-GFP was detected in plasma membrane, and FM4-64-labeled compartments in the root meristem and elongation zones
    + The molecular mechanism involved in cell wall dynamics has not been well clarified, although it is quite important for organ growth
    + We characterized a rice mutant, root growth inhibiting (rt), which is defective in root elongation
    + The enzymatic analysis of root extracts from the wild-type and rt mutant indicated that RT hydrolyzes noncrystalline amorphous cellulose
    + The cellulose content was slightly increased but the crystallinity of cellulose was decreased in the rt root
    + In addition, the hemicellulose composition was different between wild-type and rt roots
    + Based on these results, we concluded that RT is involved in the disassembly of the cell wall for cell elongation in roots as well as for root cap exfoliation from the epidermal cell layer by hydrolyzing the noncrystalline amorphous cellulose fibers of cellulose microfibrils resulting in loosening of the hemicellulose and cellulose interaction
    + Previously, we showed that OsGLU3, a beta-1,4-endoglucanase, can affect the cellulose synthesis for root elongation in rice
    + In order to identify new genes involved in root elongation in rice, we screened an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized rice library, and isolated a short root mutant, Osglu3-1
    + Exogenous application of glucose can suppress both the lower root cell wall cellulose content and short root phenotypes of Osglu3-1
    + Consistently, OsGLU3 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues with strong expression in root tip, lateral root, and crown root primodia
    + We also found that phosphate starvation, an environmental stress, altered cell wall cellulose content to modulate root elongation in a OsGLU3-dependant way
    + OsGLU3, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, is required for root cell elongation and division in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Modulating the root elongation by phosphate/nitrogen starvation in an OsGLU3 dependant way in rice
    + And the phosphate starvation induced root elongation in rice depends on the function of OsGLU3
    + The rt mutant showed a severe defect in cell elongation at the root-elongating zone with additional collapse of epidermal and cortex cells at the root tip caused by the defect in the smooth exfoliation of root cap cells
    + Consistent with these phenotypes, expression of the RT gene, which encodes a member of the membrane-anchored endo-1,4-β-d-glucanase, was specifically localized in the root-elongating zone and at the junction between epidermal and root cap cells
    + The total extensibility was significantly lower in the rt root explants
