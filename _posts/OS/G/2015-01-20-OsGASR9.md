* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, by measuring the GA-induced lengths of the second leaf sheaths and α-amylase activity levels of seeds, we concluded that OsGASR9 is a positive regulator of responses to GA in rice
    + OsGASR9 positively regulates grain size and yield in rice (Oryza sativa).
    + Conversely, the overexpression of OsGASR9 in the two backgrounds increased plant height and grain size
    + Thus, OsGASR9 may regulate plant height, grain size and yield through the GA pathway and could have an application value in breeding
    + OsGASR9 localized to the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus
