    + [AB054084](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB054084)

* **Key message**  
    + We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
    + Although both genes show transient expression, the highest level for OsGA3ox1 is from unopened flower
