* **Key message**  
    + We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
    + Although both genes show transient expression, the highest level for OsGA3ox1 is from unopened flower
    + In addition, we generate an osga3ox1 knockout mutant by genome editing and demonstrate the bioactive gibberellic acid synthesis by the OsGA3ox1 action during starch accumulation in pollen via invertase regulation
