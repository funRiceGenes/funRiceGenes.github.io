* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, our results indicate that OsGRDP1 is a critical feedback regulator, thus contributing to the elucidation of the mechanism underlying cell death and disease resistance
    + OsGRDP1 was expressed constitutively in all of the organs of the wild-type plants, but it was upregulated throughout plant development in the spl-D mutant
    + Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype
    + Moreover, the intact protein level of OsGRDP1 was reduced in the spotted leaves from both OE and RNAi plants, suggesting that the disruption of intact OsGRDP1 is responsible for lesion formation
    + LSL1 controls cell death and grain production by stabilizing chloroplast in rice.
    + RNA sequencing, gene expression, and protein activity analyses indicate that LSL1 is required for chloroplast function
    + Furthermore, LSL1 interacts with PsaD and PAP10 to form a regulatory module that functions in chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development to maintain redox balance
    + Our results reveal that LSL1 maintains chloroplast structure, redox homeostasis, and DNA stability, and plays important roles in the interaction between genetic factors and environmental signals and in regulating grain size and quality
    + The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and comet assays revealed that the lsl1 mutant contained severe DNA damage, resulting in reduced grain yield and quality
    + In addition, the lsl1 mutant exhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation and cell death
    + The lesion phenotype of the lsl1 mutant was sharply induced by shading, and its detached leaves incubated in 6-benzylamino purine similarly formed lesions in the dark
