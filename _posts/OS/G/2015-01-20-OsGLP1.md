* **Key message**  
    + " The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H(2)O(2) upon infection by fungal pathogen (Fusarium solani) and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent (ammonium persulfate), respectively"
    + Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
    + Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues
    + Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 (OsGLP1), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco
    + The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant
    + Our findings demonstrate that the OsGLP1 with its inherent SOD activity is responsible for hyper-accumulation of H(2)O(2) and reinforcement of the cell wall components
