1. __biotic stress__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D), " The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H2O2 upon infection by fungal pathogen Fusarium solani and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent ammonium persulfate), respectively"
2. __abiotic stress__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D), " The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H2O2 upon infection by fungal pathogen Fusarium solani and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent ammonium persulfate), respectively"
3. __height__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
4. __cell wall__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
5. __vegetative__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues
6. __disease resistance__, [Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components%5BTitle%5D), Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 OsGLP1), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase SOD activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco
7. __disease__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant
8. __disease__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant
9. __dwarf__, [Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant
