    + [BAD67543.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BAD67543.1)

* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles

* **Connection**  
    + __OsGASR1__, __OsGASR2__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D), Two different types of genes for rice GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) homologue genes, Oryza sativa GA-stimulated transcript-related gene 1 (OsGASR1) and gene 2 (OsGASR2), were found
