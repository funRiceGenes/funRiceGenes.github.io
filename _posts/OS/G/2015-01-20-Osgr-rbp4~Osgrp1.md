## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response%5BTitle%5D),  Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
2. __temperature__, [Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response%5BTitle%5D),  Ectopic over-expression of Osgr-rbp4 cDNA imparts high temperature stress tolerance to wild type yeast cells
3. __cell elongation__, [Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, the expression of the Osgrp1 gene is closely associated with cell elongation/expansion during the post-mitotic cell differentiation process
4. __cell elongation__, [Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation%5BTitle%5D), Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation
5. __root__, [Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation%5BTitle%5D),  The Osgrp1-Gus gene was also expressed in response to wounding and down-regulated by water-stress conditions in the elongation region of roots
6. __leaf__, [Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response%5BTitle%5D),  It is shown that OsGR-RBP4 in rice leaf cells and its immunologically homologous protein in tobacco BY2 protoplasts are nuclear proteins
7. __cell wall__, [Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation%5BTitle%5D), To study the expression and regulation of a rice glycine-rich cell wall protein gene, Osgrp1, transgenic rice plants were regenerated that contain the Osgrp1 promoter or its 5' deletions fused with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene
8. __seedling__, [Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response%5BTitle%5D),  Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
9. __abiotic stress__, [Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a novel isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycine rich-RNA binding protein and evidence for its involvement in high temperature stress response%5BTitle%5D),  Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
