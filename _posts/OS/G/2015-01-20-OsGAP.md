* **Key message**  
    + PHS9 or OsGAP overexpression plants showed reduced, while PHS9 or OsGAP knockout mutant plants showed increased ABA sensitivity in seed germination, suggesting that PHS9 and OsGAP acted as negative regulators in ABA signaling during seed germination
    + Interestingly, the germination of PHS9 and OsGAP overexpression or knockout plant seeds was weakly promoted by H2 O2 , implying that PHS9 and OsGAP could affect the ROS signaling during seed germination
