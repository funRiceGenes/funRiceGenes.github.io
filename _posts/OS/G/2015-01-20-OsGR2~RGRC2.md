* **Key message**  
    + The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with 150 mM NaCl
    + In fact, exogenous application of ABA enhanced the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots
    + On inhibiting ABA accumulation with sodium tungstate (Tu), an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 was still induced by NaCl; therefore, NaCl-triggered expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots is not mediated by accumulation of ABA
    + However, NaCl treatment could induce H2O2 production in rice roots, and H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction
    + Moreover, the increase in H2O2 level was prior to the induction of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in NaCl-treated rice roots
    + Thus, H2O2, but not ABA, is involved in regulation of OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression in NaCl-treated rice roots
    + mRNA and protein of RGRC2 were observed mainly in roots and calli but little in leaf tissues
    + From the presence of two ABA-responsive elements in the 5'-flanking region of RGRC2, we examined the expression in rice seedlings treated with ABA and the ABA-related environmental stresses, chilling, drought and salinity

    + Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome

    + NaCl-induced OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component
