* **Key message**  
    + OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.
    + Our findings reveal that OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and is required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm free nucleus positioning, suggesting a critical role in sexual reproduction of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants
    + Here, we report that OsGCD1 (GAMETE CELLS DEFECTIVE1) dysfunction influenced pollen development and disrupted pollen germination
    + Our findings also indicate that osgcd1 mutation resulted in rice male sterility in which pollen has full cell viability and generated normal gametes, but lacks the potential to germinate
