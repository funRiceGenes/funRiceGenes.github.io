* **Key message**  
    + OsGF14h acts as a signal switch to balance ABA signaling and GA biosynthesis by interacting with the transcription factors OsHOX3 and OsVP1, thereby boosting the seeding rate from 13
    + Here, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-coding gene OsGF14h in weedy rice that confers anaerobic germination and anaerobic seedling development tolerance
    + Meanwhile, OsGF14h co-inheritance with the Rc (red pericarp gene) promotes divergence between temperate japonica cultivated rice and temperate japonica weedy rice through artificial and natural selection
