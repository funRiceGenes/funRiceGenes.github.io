* **Key message**  
    + This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence
    + This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses
    + Expression of OsGH3-2 was induced by drought but was suppressed by cold
    + It was conclude that OsGH3-2 modulates both endogenous free IAA and ABA homeostasis and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice
    + A GH3 family member, OsGH3-2, modulates auxin and abscisic acid levels and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice
    + Here, it is reported that a GH3 family gene, OsGH3-2, encoding an enzyme catalysing IAA conjugation to amino acids, is involved in the modulation of ABA level and stress tolerance
    + Overexpression of OsGH3-2 in rice caused significant morphological aberrations related to IAA deficiency, such as dwarfism, smaller leaves, and fewer crown roots and root hairs
    + It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8
    + OsGH3-2 was dominantly expressed in the developing seeds and catalyzed IAA conjugation to amino acids, forming inactive auxin
    + OsGH3-2 was identified by performing a genome-wide association study in rice germplasms with linkage mapping in chromosome substitution segment lines, contributing to the wide variation of seed viability in the populations after long periods of storage and artificial ageing
    + Transgenic overexpression, knockout and knockdown experiments demonstrated that OsGH3-2 affected seed storability by regulating the accumulation level of abscisic acid
    + Overexpression of OsGH3-2 significantly decreased seed storability, while knockout or knockdown of the gene enhanced seed storability compared with the wild type
    + OsGH3-2 acted as a negative regulator of seed storability by modulating many genes related to the abscisic acid pathway and probably subsequently late embryogenesis-abundant proteins at the transcription level
