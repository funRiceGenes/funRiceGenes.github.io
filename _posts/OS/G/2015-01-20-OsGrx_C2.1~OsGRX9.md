    + Overexpression of Rice Glutaredoxin OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 Reduces Intracellular Arsenic Accumulation and Increases Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    + The basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP83 and the glutaredoxins OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 facilitate rice iron utilization under the control of OsHRZ ubiquitin ligases.
    + Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsGRX9 and OsbZIP83 showed improved tolerance to iron deficiency
    + OsbZIP83 overexpression lines showed enhanced expression of OsYSL2 and OsNAS3, which are involved in internal iron translocation, in addition to OsGRX9 and genes related to phytoalexin biosynthesis and the salicylic acid pathway
    + Expression of iron-related genes was affected in the OsGRX9 and OsGRX6 knockdown lines, suggesting disturbed iron utilization and signaling
    + The results suggest that OsbZIP83, OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 facilitate iron utilization downstream of the OsHRZ pathway
