## Key message
1. __root__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern analysis with a 3'-UTR gene-specific probe revealed that OsGLN2 is expressed exclusively in the paleae and lemmas during flowering, and no expression of OsGLN2 was detected in other tissues such as leaf blades, leaf sheaths, stems, nodes and roots in mature rice plants
2. __endosperm__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsGLN2 gene is also expressed in germinating seeds, where its expression is predominant in endosperms rather than embryos
3. __flower__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsGLN2, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds%5BTitle%5D)), We report here the isolation and characterization of a new endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (1,3-beta-GLU) cDNA, OsGLN2, that is expressed both in flowers and in germinating seeds of rice (Oryza sativa L
