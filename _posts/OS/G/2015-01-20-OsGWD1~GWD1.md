* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of a rice gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth
    + Analysis of the gwd1 plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of GWD1 caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination
    + Therefore, our study shows that GWD1 is not only involved in transitory starch degradation in source tissues, but also plays key roles in the seeds, which is a sink tissue
    + In conclusion, we find that GWD1 is an ideal biotechnological target with promising potential for the breeding of elite rice cultivars via genetic engineering
