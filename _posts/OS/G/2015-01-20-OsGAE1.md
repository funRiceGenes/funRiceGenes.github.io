## Key message
1. __meristem__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves
2. __root__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D),  OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root
3. __reproductive__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth
4. __gibberellin__, [The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth%5BTitle%5D), The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth
