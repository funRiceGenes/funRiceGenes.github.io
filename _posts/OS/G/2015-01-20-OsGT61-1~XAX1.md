* **Key message**  
    + OsGT61-1 transcript was noted to be ABA- and NaCl-responsive and its expression was more prominent in root than in shoot tissues
    + Ultimately, XAX1 plays a fundamental role in cross-linking, providing a potential target for the improvement of use of grass biomass
    + Moreover, structures resembling the direct cross-link between xylan and lignin (ferulated arabinosyl substitutions bound to lignin monomers and dimers), together with diferulates known to cross-link xylan, are strongly reduced in xax1
    + XAX1 (Xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1), a rice (Oryza sativa) member of the glycosyltransferase family GT61, has been described to add xylosyl residues to arabinosyl substitutions modified by ferulic acid
