* **Key message**  
    + Osgr-rbp4 transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress
    + Ectopic over-expression of Osgr-rbp4 cDNA imparts high temperature stress tolerance to wild type yeast cells
    + Thus, the expression of the Osgrp1 gene is closely associated with cell elongation/expansion during the post-mitotic cell differentiation process
    + Expression of the rice Osgrp1 promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation
    + The Osgrp1-Gus gene was also expressed in response to wounding and down-regulated by water-stress conditions in the elongation region of roots
    + It is shown that OsGR-RBP4 in rice leaf cells and its immunologically homologous protein in tobacco BY2 protoplasts are nuclear proteins
    + To study the expression and regulation of a rice glycine-rich cell wall protein gene, Osgrp1, transgenic rice plants were regenerated that contain the Osgrp1 promoter or its 5' deletions fused with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene
