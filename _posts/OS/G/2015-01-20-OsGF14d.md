* **Key message**  
    + OsATL38 mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice
    + The osgf14d knockout mutant plants were more sensitive to cold stress than wild-type rice plants, indicating that OsGF14d is a positive factor in the response to cold stress
    + These results suggested that the RING E3 Ub ligase OsATL38 negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice via mono-ubiquitination of OsGF14d 14-3-3 protein
