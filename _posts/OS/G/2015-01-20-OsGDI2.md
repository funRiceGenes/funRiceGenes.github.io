## Connection
1. __OsGDI1__, __OsGDI2__, [Characterization of two fungal-elicitor-induced rice cDNAs encoding functional homologues of the rab-specific GDP-dissociation inhibitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of two fungal-elicitor-induced rice cDNAs encoding functional homologues of the rab-specific GDP-dissociation inhibitor%5BTitle%5D),  Using polymerase-chain-reaction products as probes, two full-length cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library of fungal-elicitor-treated rice, and designated as OsGDI1 and OsGDI2
