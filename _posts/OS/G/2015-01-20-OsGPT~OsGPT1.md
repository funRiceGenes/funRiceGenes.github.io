* **Key message**  
    + A cDNA clone encoding glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) was isolated from a cDNA library of immature seeds of rice and named as OsGPT
    + The OsGPT gene maps on chromosome 8 of rice and is linked to the quantitative trait locus for 1000-grain weight
    + Here, we report the functional characterization of OsGPT1 in the rice anther development and pollen fertility
    + This report highlights a sporophytic role of OsGPT1 in the tapetum degeneration and pollen development
    + The divergent functions of OsGPT1 and AtGPT1 in pollen development might be a result of their independent evolution after monocots and dicots diverged
    + Pollen grains from homozygous osgpt1 mutant plants fail to accumulate starch granules, resulting in pollen sterility
    + Degeneration of the tapetum, an important process to provide cellular contents to support pollen development, is impeded in osgpt1 plants
    + In addition, defective intine and exine are observed in the pollen from osgpt1 plants
    + Expression levels of multiple genes that are important to tapetum degeneration or pollen wall formation are significantly decreased in osgpt1 anthers
    + OsGPT1 is highly expressed in the tapetal layer of rice anther
