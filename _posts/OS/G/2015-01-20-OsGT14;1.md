* **Key message**  
    + OsGT14;1 was broadly expressed in all organs throughout the entire growth period, with a relatively high expression in the roots, stems, nodeâ€‰I and husk
    + Taken together, OsGT14;1 located at the Golgi is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice through affecting cellulose synthesis
    + The knockout of OsGT14;1 did not affect the tolerance to toxic mineral elements, including Al, As, Cd and salt stress, but did increase the sensitivity to low pH
    + Mutation of OsGT14;1 resulted in decreased cellulose content and increased hemicellulose, but did not alter pectin in the cell wall of roots and shoots
    + A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, OsGT14;1, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice
