* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of a cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene OsGAPC3 confers salt tolerance in rice
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsGAPC3 showed enhanced tolerance to salt stress
    + Furthermore, we found that OsGAPC3 could alleviate the salt toxicity through the regulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels
    + Taken together, these results indicate that OsGAPC3 plays important roles in salt stress tolerance in rice
