* **Key message**  
    + Salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid triggered osgstu4 and osgstu3 expression
    + PEG and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM), Zn (30 microM), Co and Ni rapidly and markedly induced osgstu4 and osgstu3 in rice seedling roots
    + Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were also induced in roots by hypoxic stress but not by cold nor heat shock
    + Salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) rapidly induced osgstu3 in rice roots, whereas osgstu4 exhibited a late salt stress and no ABA response
    + Osgstu3 and osgtu4, encoding tau class glutathione S-transferases, are heavy metal- and hypoxic stress-induced and differentially salt stress-responsive in rice roots
