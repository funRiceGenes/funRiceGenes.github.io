* **Key message**  
    + The Saltol QTL-localized transcription factor OsGATA8 plays an important role in  stress tolerance and seed development in Arabidopsis and rice.
    + Using genetic, molecular, and physiological analyses, in this study we show that OsGATA8 increases seed size and tolerance to abiotic stresses in both Arabidopsis and rice
    + OsGATA8 produced these effects by regulating the expression of critical genes involved in stress tolerance, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and chlorophyll biosynthesis
