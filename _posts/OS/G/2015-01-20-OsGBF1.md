* **Key message**  
    + Identification of splice variant of OsGBF1 in Oryza sativa ssp. indica genotypes under salinity stress.
    + In this study, we analyzed the expression of OsGBF1 during salt stress in two contrasting Oryza sativa spp
    + This is the first report on OsGBF1 splice variant and the variant could have specific functions linked to stress tolerance in rice
