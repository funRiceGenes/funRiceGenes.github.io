* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In the root, OsGatB was predominantly expressed in the root tip and played an important role in cell division and elongation there
    + OsGatB was localized in the mitochondria, and mitochondrial structure and function were all affected in Osgatb root tip cells
