    + OsGRAS19 may be a novel component involved in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice
    + Novel OsGRAS19 mutant, D26, positively regulates grain shape in rice (Oryza sativa).
    + Gene D26 is a novel site mutation of OsGRAS19 and involved in the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway
    + We characterized the function of OsSCL7 in rice disease resistance
    + oryzae and pathogen-associated molecular pattern treatments, and knocking out OsSCL7 resulted in decreased disease resistance of rice to M
    + In contrast, overexpression of OsSCL7 could improve rice disease resistance to M
    + The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.
    + Taken together, these findings uncover the important roles of OsSCL7 and GF14c in plant immunity and a potential mechanism by which plants fine-tune immunity by regulating the protein stability of a GRAS protein via a 14-3-3 protein
    + OsSCL7 was mainly localized in the nucleus and showed transcriptional activity
    + Cytological analysis showed that WG3 regulates grain size by affecting cell proliferation
    + Moreover, we found that WG3 directly interacts with DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT), a previously reported GRAS protein, and a genetic experiment demonstrated that WG3 and DLT function in a common pathway to regulate grain size
    + CONCLUSION: WG3 functions directly in regulating grain size and BR signaling in rice
    + Additionally, a brassinosteroid (BR) sensitivity test suggested that WG3 has a positive role in BR signaling in rice
