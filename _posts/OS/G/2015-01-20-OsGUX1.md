* **Key message**  
    + The overexpression of OsGUX1 reduced chlorophyll content, and the suppression of this gene increased chlorophyll content of rice leaf
    + OsGUX1 is located in Golgi apparatus, and highly expressed in seedling leaf and the tissues in which primary cell wall synthesis occurring
    + Our experimental data indicate that OsGUX1 is responsible for addition of glucuronic acid residues onto xylan and participates in accumulation of cellulose and hemicellulose in the cell wall deposition, thus thickening the primary cell wall of mesophyll cells, which might lead to reduced chlorophyll content in rice leaf
