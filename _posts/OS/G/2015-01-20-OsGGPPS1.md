* **Key message**  
    + A functionally active homodimeric enzyme composed of two OsGGPPS1 subunits is located in the stroma
    + Taken together, genetic and biochemical analyses suggest OsGRP functions in recruiting OsGGPPS1 from the stroma toward thylakoid membranes, thus providing a mechanism to control GGPP flux toward chlorophyll biosynthesis
