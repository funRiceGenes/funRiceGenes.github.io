## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses%5BTitle%5D)), " Here, we report the role of a CC-type GRX gene from rice, OsGRX8, in abiotic stress tolerance

4. __auxin__, [Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGRX8 protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytosol and its gene expression is induced by various stress conditions and plant hormone auxin
5. __auxin__, [Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  The over-expression of OsGRX8 in Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to auxin and stress hormone, abscisic acid
