* **Key message**  
    + Constitutive expression of OsGH3.1 reduces auxin content and enhances defense response and resistance to a fungal pathogen in rice
    + LC1 is transcribed in various tissues and encodes OsGH3-1, an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) amido synthetase, whose homolog of Arabidopsis functions in maintaining the auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess IAA to various amino acids
    + Phenotypic analysis confirmed the exaggerated leaf angles of lc1-D due to the stimulated cell elongation at the lamina joint
    + The transcript abundance of nearly all OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4
    + Indeed, recombinant LC1 can catalyze the conjugation of IAA to Ala, Asp, and Asn in vitro, which is consistent with the decreased free IAA amount in lc1-D mutant
    + lc1-D is insensitive to IAA and hypersensitive to exogenous BR, in agreement with the microarray analysis that reveals the altered transcriptions of genes involved in auxin signaling and BR biosynthesis
    + Studies on the rice LEAF INCLINATION1 (LC1), an IAA-amido synthetase, reveal the effects of auxin in leaf inclination control
    + Through genetic screening, a rice gain-of-function mutant leaf inclination1, lc1-D, was identified from the Shanghai T-DNA Insertion Population (SHIP)
