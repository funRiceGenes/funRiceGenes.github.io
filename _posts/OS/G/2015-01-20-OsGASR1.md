* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
    + In the osgasr1 mutants, the second leaf blades were much longer than those of the segregating wild type due to an increase in cell length
    + These results suggest that OsGASR1 plays important roles in seedling growth and α-amylase gene expression
    + From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment

    + __OsGASR1__, __OsGASR2__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D), Two different types of genes for rice GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) homologue genes, Oryza sativa GA-stimulated transcript-related gene 1 (OsGASR1) and gene 2 (OsGASR2), were found
