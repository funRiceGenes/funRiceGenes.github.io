## Expression information

## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
2. __cell division__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles

## Connection
1. __OsGASR1__, __OsGASR2__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)), Two different types of genes for rice GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) homologue genes, Oryza sativa GA-stimulated transcript-related gene 1 (OsGASR1) and gene 2 (OsGASR2), were found
2. __OsGASR1__, __OsGASR2__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGASR1 was limitedly but strongly expressed in florets while OsGASR2 was expressed in both florets and branches
3. __OsGASR1__, __OsGASR2__, [Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles
