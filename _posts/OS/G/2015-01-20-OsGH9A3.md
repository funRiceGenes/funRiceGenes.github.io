## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [Global identification of multiple OsGH9 family members and their involvement in cellulose crystallinity modification in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Global identification of multiple OsGH9 family members and their involvement in cellulose crystallinity modification in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Our results showed that OsGH9A3 and B5 possessed an extremely high co-expression with OsCESA1, 3, and 8 typical for cellulose biosynthesis in rice
