    + Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight
    + The germin-like protein OsGLP2-1 enhances resistance to fungal blast and bacterial blight in rice.
    + In addition to its resistance to blast and bacterial blight, OsGLP2-1 has also been reported to co-localize with a QTLs for sheath blight resistance in rice
    + These suggest that the disease resistance provided by OsGLP2-1 is quantitative and broad spectrum
    + Together, these results suggest that OsGLP2-1 functions as a positive regulator to modulate disease resistance
    + Moreover, OsGLP2-1 was significantly induced by jasmonic acid (JA)
    + Higher endogenous level of JA was also identified in OsGLP2-1 overexpressing plants than in control plants both before and after pathogen inoculation
    + Compared with empty vector transformed (control) plants, the OsGLP2-1 overexpressing plants exhibited higher levels of H2O2 both before and after pathogen inoculation
    + Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 induced three well-characterized defense-related genes which are associated in JA-dependent pathway after pathogen infection
    + We provide evidence that OsGLP2-1 is antagonistically controlled at the transcriptional level by ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) and GAMYB transcription factors
    + We conclude that OsGLP2-1 acts as a buffer, maintaining appropriate equilibrium for the regulation of primary dormancy during seed development in rice
    + Conversely, overexpression of OsGLP2-1 driven by the OsGLP2-1 native promoter led to greater seed dormancy
    + Seed scutellum-specific expression of OsGLP2-1 was increased by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but decreased with gibberellic acid (GA) treatment
    + Using artificial microRNA (miRNA) and CRISPR/CAS9 approaches, suppression of OsGLP2-1 expression in rice resulted in the release of dormancy in immature seeds
