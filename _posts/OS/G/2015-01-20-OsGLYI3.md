* **Key message**  
    + Our previous study suggested that OsGLYI3 may be effective in seed natural aging
    + In this study, the rice OsGLYI3 gene was cloned and characterized as specifically expressed in the seed
    + The accelerated aging (AA) treatment results indicated significant roles of OsGLYI3 in seed longevity and vigor, as the seeds of the transgenic lines with overexpressed and knocked-out OsGLYI3 exhibited higher and lower germination, respectively
    + Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that OsGLYI3 is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance
    + Rice OsGLYI3 was markedly upregulated in response to NaCl induced stress conditions
