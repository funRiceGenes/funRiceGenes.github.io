## Key message

2. __gibberellin__, [OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Within this mapped region, we identified the gene OsGA20ox1, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis
3. __dwarf__, [The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
4. __seedling__, [OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that OsGA20ox1 is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice

## Connection
1. __OsGA20ox1__, __sd1~GA20ox2__, [A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature
2. __d18~OsGA3ox2__, __OsGA20ox1__, [The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
3. __GD1__, __OsGA20ox1__, [The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
