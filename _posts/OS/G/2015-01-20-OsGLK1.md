## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  Using rice expression-microarray and northern blot analyses, we found that a large number of nucleus-encoded genes involved in chloroplast functions were highly expressed and transcripts of plastid-encoded genes, psaA, psbA and rbcL, increased in the OsGLK1-FOX calli
2. __chloroplast__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  Transmission electron microscopy showed the existence of differentiated chloroplasts with grana stacks in OsGLK1-FOX calli cells
3. __chloroplast__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
4. __chloroplast__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  The OsGLK1-FOX calli exhibited high photosynthetic activity and were able to grow on sucrose-depleted media, indicating that developed chloroplasts in OsGLK1-FOX rice calli are functional and active
5. __chloroplast__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development

7. __transcription factor__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  In both lines, OsGLK1 cDNA encoding a GARP transcription factor was ectopically overexpressed
8. __transcription factor__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D), Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells
9. __seedling__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
10. __phytohormone__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development
11. __vascular bundle__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
12. __sheath__, [Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings
