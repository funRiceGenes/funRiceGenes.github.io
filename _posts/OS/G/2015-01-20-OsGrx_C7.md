    + Overexpression of Rice Glutaredoxin OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 Reduces Intracellular Arsenic Accumulation and Increases Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    + Gene expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 expression was induced under salt stress and ubiquitously expressed in rice including root and shoot
    + A gain-of-function approach showed that OsGrx_C7 may act as an important determinant in salt stress, compared with WT, and revealed higher biomass accumulation, improved root and plant growth under salt stress
    + CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGrx_C7 plays a crucial role in enhancing protection against salt stress in rice
    + Gene expression analysis, silencing, and overexpression of OsGrx_C7 gene were used to discover the role of OsGrx_C7 in response to salt stress
    + The silencing of osgrx_c7 gene leads to increased sensitivity to salt stress, indicating its importance in salt stress tolerance
    + Under salt stress condition, OsGrx_C7 overexpressing rice plants showed lower level of lipid peroxidation and Na+/K+ ratio, while proline accumulation, soluble sugar content and GSH/GSSG ratio was higher compared to WT
    + Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants
    + Overall our study revealed that OsGrx_C7 emerged as a key mediator in response to salt stress in rice and could be used for engineering tolerance against salt stress in rice and other crops
