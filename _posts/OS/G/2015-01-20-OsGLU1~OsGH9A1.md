* **Key message**  
    + Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
    + These results indicate that OsGLU1 plays important roles in plant cell growth
    + Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression
    + 3, OsGLU1 and OsGLU2, between NR and NRT, coupled with the NR activity pattern in the roots, would indicate the prevalence of nitrate (NO3Ë‰) transport over ammonium (NH4+) transport
