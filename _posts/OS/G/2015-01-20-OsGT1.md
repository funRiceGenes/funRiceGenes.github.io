## Expression information

## Key message
1. __mitosis__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
2. __grain__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
3. __pollen__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa)
4. __pollen__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
5. __pollen__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted
6. __pollen__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
7. __reproductive__, [Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
