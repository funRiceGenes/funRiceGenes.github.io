* **Key message**  
    + Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains
    + We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted
    + Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development
