* **Key message**  
    + The mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is essential for H2O2 homeostasis and root and shoot development in rice
    + Transgenic rice plants have been generated that lack mitochondrial OsGPX3
    + These GPX3s plants showed shorter roots and shoots compared to non-transformed (NT) plants, and higher amounts of H2O2 mitochondrial release were observed in the roots of these plants cultivated under normal conditions
    + These results suggest that silencing the mitochondrial OsGPX3 gene impairs normal plant development and leads to a stress-induced morphogenic response via H2O2 accumulation
    + This accumulation of H2O2 is positively associated with shorter root length in GPX3s plants compared to NT ones
    + Moreover, GPX3 promoter analysis indicated that it is mainly expressed in root tissue
