## Expression information

## Key message
1. __starch__, [Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm%5BTitle%5D),  OsGBSSII was mainly expressed in leaves and its protein was exclusively bound to starch granules in rice leaves, which suggests that the amylose in rice leaves is synthesized by OsGBSSII
2. __nitrate__, [Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm%5BTitle%5D),  N-starvation-induced expression of OsGBSSII could be repressed by supplying nitrate, ammonia or amino acid glutamic acid or glutamine), glucosamine an inhibitor of hexokinase or dark conditions
3. __nitrogen__, [Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of the granule-bound starch synthase II gene in rice: gene expression is regulated by the nitrogen level, sugar and circadian rhythm%5BTitle%5D), 21 was cloned and defined as OsGBSSII based on a Nitrogen N-starvation-induced cDNA library constructed using the rapid subtraction hybridization method
