* **Key message**  
    + OsGBSSII was mainly expressed in leaves and its protein was exclusively bound to starch granules in rice leaves, which suggests that the amylose in rice leaves is synthesized by OsGBSSII
    + N-starvation-induced expression of OsGBSSII could be repressed by supplying nitrate, ammonia or amino acid (glutamic acid or glutamine), glucosamine (an inhibitor of hexokinase) or dark conditions
    + 21) was cloned and defined as OsGBSSII based on a Nitrogen (N)-starvation-induced cDNA library constructed using the rapid subtraction hybridization method
