* **Key message**  
    + OsGIRL1 was induced on exposure to abiotic stresses such as salt, osmotic, and heat, salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA), but exhibited downregulation in response to jasmonic acid (JA) treatment
    + The biological function of OsGIRL1 was investigated via heterologous overexpression of this gene in Arabidopsis plants subjected to gamma-ray irradiation, salt stress, osmotic stress, and heat stress
    + The OsGIRL1 protein was clearly localized at the plasma membrane
