    + __OsGRF3__, __OSH71~Oskn2__, [Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D), These effects were associated with down-regulation of endogenous Oskn2 expression by OsGRF3
