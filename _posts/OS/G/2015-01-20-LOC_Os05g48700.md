* **Key message**  
    + The plants overexpressing OsGA2ox8 showed reduced lengths of shoots and roots at the seedling stage, but no difference in plant height at the heading stage was observed, which may be due to the interaction of OsGA2ox8 and OsGA20ox1, implying a complex feedback regulation between GA biosynthesis and metabolism in rice
    + Importantly, OsGA2ox8 was able to indirectly regulate several genes associated with the anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway, and overexpression of OsGA2ox8 activated JA signal transduction by inhibiting the expression of jasmonate ZIM domain-containing proteins
    + Molecular Dissection of the Gene OsGA2ox8 Conferring Osmotic Stress Tolerance in Rice
    + The overexpression of OsGA2ox8 significantly enhanced the osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic rice plants by increasing the number of osmotic regulators and antioxidants
    + The OsGA2ox8 protein was localized in the nucleus, cell membrane, and cytoplasm, and was induced in response to various abiotic stresses and phytohormones
    + OsGA2ox8 was differentially expressed in the shoots and roots to cope with osmotic stress
