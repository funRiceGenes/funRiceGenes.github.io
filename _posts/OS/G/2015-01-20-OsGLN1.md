* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsGLN1 is up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and the accumulation of OsGLN1 transcript is more in the roots of rice seedlings
    + These results clearly indicated that the endo-1,3-β-glucanase encoded by OsGLN1 plays an important role associated with plant defence against abiotic and biotic stresses particularly for drought and fungal pathogen in rice seedlings
    + The GST-OsGLN1 recombinant protein rapidly hydrolyzed the cell wall β-glucans of rice fungal pathogen, Pyricularia oryzae, other than typical substrates for endo-1,3-β-glucanase
