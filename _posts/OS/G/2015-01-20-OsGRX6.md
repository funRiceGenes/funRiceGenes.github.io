* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.
    + The OsGRX6 overexpressors contain a higher nitrogen content than the wild type, indicating that OsGRX6 plays a role in homeostatic regulation of nitrogen use
    + These data suggest that OsGRX6 affects hormone signaling and nitrogen status in rice plants
    + Consistent with this, OsGRX6 overexpressors displayed delayed chlorophyll degradation and senescence compared to the wild type plants
    + The rice CC-type proteins, OsGRX6 was identified during the screening for genes whose expression changes depending on the level of available nitrate
