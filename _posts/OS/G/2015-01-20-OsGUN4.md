## Expression information
__Expression__: The expression of OsGUN4, however, was significantly reduced in HYB compared with LTB in terms of both transcript abundance (0 |  In summary, we have identified an epi-allele of OsGUN4 as the causal gene of the xantha marker trait and revealed that enhanced methylation in its promoter down-regulated its expression in rice
