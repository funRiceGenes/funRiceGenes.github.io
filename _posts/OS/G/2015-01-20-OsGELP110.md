    + [GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, J Integr Plant Biol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsGELP34 is distant from OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 in sequence, and osgelp34 and osgelp110/osgelp115 mutants were different in anther morphology despite both were male sterile
    + Individual knockout of OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 did not affect the plant fertility, but double knockout of both genes altered the exine structure and rendered the plant male sterile
    + OsGELP110 was previously identified as a gene differentially expressed in meiotic anthers
