* **Key message**  
    + The osgasd knockout (Ko) mutation reduced GA3 content in shoots as well as plant growth and height
    + These observations suggest that OsGASD is involved in maintaining GA homeostasis to regulate plant development, thereby affecting rice growth and productivity
    + Transcriptome analysis of flag leaves of OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants revealed that OsGASD regulates cell development and the expression of elongation-related genes
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsGASD (Ox) showed increased plant height and grain yield compared to the WT
    + However, GA application restored the plant height of the osgasd Ko mutant to a height similar to that of the wild type (WT)
