## Key message
1. __ BR __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis
2. __ BR __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsGSR1 activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post-translational level
3. __ BR __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways
4. __root__, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
5. __brassinosteroid__, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice
6. __ ga __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we demonstrate that OsGSR1, a member of the GAST (GA-stimulated transcript) gene family, is induced by GA and repressed by BR
7. __ ga __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling
8. __ ga __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways
9. __fertility__, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
10. __ethylene__, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis

12. __primary root__, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility
