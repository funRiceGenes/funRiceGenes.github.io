* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrate that OsGRX20 functioned as a positive regulator in rice tolerance to multiple stresses, which may be of significant use in the genetic improvement of rice resistance
    + OsGRX20 protein was localized in nucleus and cytosol, and its transcripts were expressed predominantly in leaves
