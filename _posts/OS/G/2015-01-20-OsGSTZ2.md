## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Cold sensitivity in rice Oryza sativa L. is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cold sensitivity in rice Oryza sativa L. is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2%5BTitle%5D), ), a major QTL quantitative trait locus for seedling cold tolerance has been fine mapped to a region containing the genes OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2
2. __chilling__, [Cold sensitivity in rice Oryza sativa L. is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cold sensitivity in rice Oryza sativa L. is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2%5BTitle%5D), " The results of the present study show that naturally occurring OsGSTZ2 isoforms differ in their enzymatic properties, which may contribute to the differential response to chilling stress generally exhibited by the two major rice subspecies"
3. __cold tolerance__, [Cold sensitivity in rice Oryza sativa L. is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cold sensitivity in rice Oryza sativa L. is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2%5BTitle%5D), "), a major QTL quantitative trait locus for seedling cold tolerance has been fine mapped to a region containing the genes OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2"
