## Expression information

## Key message
1. __salt stress__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice
2. __salt stress__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice
3. __salt__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice
4. __salt__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice
5. __salt__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa)  
6. __transporter__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, reversed genetics was used to identify OsGMST1 as a member of the monosaccharide transporter family in rice
7. __transporter__, [Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter OsGMST1 confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The predicted 481 amino acid protein has the typical features of a sugar transporter in the plastid glucose transporter subfamily consistent with reduced monosaccharide accumulation in plants with reduced OsGMST1 expression
