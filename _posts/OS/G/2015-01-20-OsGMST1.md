* **Key message**  
    + OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice
    + OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice
    + Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + In this study, reversed genetics was used to identify OsGMST1 as a member of the monosaccharide transporter family in rice
    + The predicted 481 amino acid protein has the typical features of a sugar transporter in the plastid glucose transporter subfamily consistent with reduced monosaccharide accumulation in plants with reduced OsGMST1 expression
