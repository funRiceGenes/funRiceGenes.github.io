* **Key message**  
    + Compared to the wild-type, the osgl1-1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought
    + In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax-deficient mutant osgl1-1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax-deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype
    + Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane
