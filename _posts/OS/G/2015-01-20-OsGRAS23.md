* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrate that OsGRAS23 encodes a stress-responsive GRAS transcription factor and positively modulates rice drought tolerance via the induction of a number of stress-responsive genes
    + The expression of OsGRAS23 was induced by drought, NaCl, and jasmonic acid treatments
    + Only OsGRAS23 (here named as OsGRAS22) was reported to code for a TF that induced drought tolerance in rice
