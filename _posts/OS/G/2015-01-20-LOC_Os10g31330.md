* **Key message**  
    + OsGRP2 participated in establishment of the cellwall network during early tapetum development
    + The tapetal cell walls of an OsGRP2 mutant did not thicken at the pollen mothercell stage, as a result, pollen maturation and fertility rate decreased
    + High OsGRP2 expression was detected in male-floral organs, and OsGRP2 was distributed in the tapetum
    + In conclusion, our results indicate that OsGRP2 plays important roles in the differentiation and function of the tapetum
