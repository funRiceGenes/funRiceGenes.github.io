* **Key message**  
    + Conclusion: OsGATA16 is a GATA transcription factor, which improves cold tolerance at seedling stage in rice
    + Overexpression of OsGATA16 improves cold tolerance of rice at seedling stage
    + In addition, haplotype analysis showed that OsGATA16 polarized between the two major rice subspecies japonica and indica, and had a non-synonymous SNP8 (336G) associated with cold tolerance
    + Additionally, OsGATA16 has a non-synonymous SNP8 (336G) associated with cold tolerance on CDS region
