* **Key message**  
    + T-DNA tagged knockout mutation of rice OsGSK1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis BIN2, with enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses
    + Therefore, we propose that stress-responsive OsGSK1 may have physiological roles in stress signal-transduction pathways and floral developmental processes
    + Overexpression of the full-length OsGSK1 led to a stunted growth phenotype similar to the one observed with the gain-of-function BIN/AtSK21 mutant
    + The gene responsible for this GUS-positive phenotype was revealed by inverse PCR as OsGSK1 (Oryza sativa glycogen synthase kinase3-like gene 1), a member of the plant GSK3/SHAGGY-like protein kinase genes and an orthologue of the Arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2), AtSK21
    + This suggests that OsGSK1 might be a functional rice orthologue that serves as a negative regulator of brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling
    + Northern blot analysis showed that OsGSK1 was most highly detected in the developing panicles, suggesting that its expression is developmental stage specific
    + Knockout (KO) mutants of OsGSK1 showed enhanced tolerance to cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses when compared with non-transgenic segregants (NT)
