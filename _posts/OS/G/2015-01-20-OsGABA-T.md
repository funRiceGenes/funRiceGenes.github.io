## Expression information

## Key message
1. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice Oryza sativa leaves infected with blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice Oryza sativa leaves infected with blast fungus%5BTitle%5D),  OsGABA-T expression is induced by blast fungus infection, mechanical wounding and ultraviolet radiation in rice leaves and is not detected in normal rice organs

3. __cell death__, [Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice Oryza sativa leaves infected with blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice Oryza sativa leaves infected with blast fungus%5BTitle%5D),  Our data suggest that OsGABA-T GABA shunt may play a role in restricting the levels of cell death during the host-pathogen interaction
