* **Key message**  
    + Compared with wild-type plants, the osgpat3 mutant displays smaller, pale yellow anthers with defective anther cuticle, degenerated pollen with defective exine, and abnormal tapetum development and degeneration
    + OsGPAT3 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores of the anther
    + OsGPAT3 Plays a Critical Role in Anther Wall Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development in Rice.
    + Based on these genetic and cytological analyses, OsGPAT3 is proposed to coordinate the differentiation and degradation of the anther wall and pollen grains in addition to regulating lipid biosynthesis
    + Complementation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) experiments demonstrated that OsGPAT3 is responsible for the male sterility phenotype
