* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Compared with wild-type plants, the osgpat3 mutant displays smaller, pale yellow anthers with defective anther cuticle, degenerated pollen with defective exine, and abnormal tapetum development and degeneration
    + OsGPAT3 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores of the anther
