* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that OsGDPD2 is a Pi deficiency responsive gene which is transcriptionally regulated by OsPHR2
    + Conversely, silencing of OsGDPD2 led to decreased GDPD activity and Pi content
    + Thus, present study provides insights into novel physiological roles of OsGDPD2 in low Pi acclimation in rice
