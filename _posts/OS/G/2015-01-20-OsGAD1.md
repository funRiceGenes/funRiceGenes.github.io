## Key message
1. __root__, [Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D),  RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
2. __seed__, [Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D),  RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
3. __shoot__, [Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D), We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library

2. __OsGAD1__, __OsGAD2__, [Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D),  Open reading frames found in OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 cDNAs encode putative proteins of 501 56
3. __OsGAD1__, __OsGAD2__, [Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, in the regions in the putative gene products corresponding to the C-terminal 30-amino-acid peptide known as the calmodulin-binding domain of plant GADs, OsGAD1 possesses a typical motif, while OsGAD2 contains several substitutions of amino acids that contribute strongly to the binding of calmodulin CaM)
