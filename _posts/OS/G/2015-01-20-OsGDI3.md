* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsGDI3  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g16900](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g16900)

* **Publication**  
    + [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D), 2011, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AK100522](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK100522)

* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we show that OsGDI3 complement the yeast sec19-1 mutant, a temperature-sensitive allele of the yeast GDI gene, suggesting that OsGDI3 is a functional ortholog of yeast GDI
