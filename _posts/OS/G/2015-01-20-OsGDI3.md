## Expression information

## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D), " In this study, we show that OsGDI3 complement the yeast sec19-1 mutant, a temperature-sensitive allele of the yeast GDI gene, suggesting that OsGDI3 is a functional ortholog of yeast GDI"

## Connection
1. __OsGDI3__, __OsMSRMK2~OsMAP1~OsMPK5~OsMAPK2~OsMAPK5~OsBIMK1~OsMPK3__, [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D),  OsMAPK2 is one of OsGDI3 interacting proteins from yeast two-hybrid screens and subject to further analysis
2. __OsGDI3__, __OsMSRMK2~OsMAP1~OsMPK5~OsMAPK2~OsMAPK5~OsBIMK1~OsMPK3__, [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D),  A kinase assay showed that the autophosphorylation activity of OsMAPK2 is inhibited by OsGDI3 in vitro
3. __OsGDI3__, __OsMSRMK2~OsMAP1~OsMPK5~OsMAPK2~OsMAPK5~OsBIMK1~OsMPK3__, [Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, OsGDI3 functions as a negative regulator of OsMAPK2 through modulating its kinase activity
