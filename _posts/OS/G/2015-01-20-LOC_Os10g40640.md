* **Key message**  
    + The accumulation of OsGGT mRNA in FR13A also increased in response to ethylene, gibberellin, abscisic acid, drought and salt treatment, but methyl jasmonate treatment and cold stress had no effect on expression
    + A submergence-induced gene, OsGGT, was cloned from 7-day submerged rice (Oryza sativa L
    + A time-course study showed that OsGGT-gene expression increased in FR13A during submergence but decreased in IR42 (submergence-intolerant cultivar, Indica)
    + These results suggest that the OsGGT gene could be related to submergence stress and associated with a general defensive response to various environmental stresses
    + Identification and cloning of a submergence-induced gene OsGGT (glycogenin glucosyltransferase) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppression subtractive hybridization
    + The expression of the OsGGT gene in FR13A was induced by salicylic acid and benzyladenine
