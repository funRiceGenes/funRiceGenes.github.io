* **Key message**  
    + Plants exposed to drought, submergence and ABA treatment showed an increased accumulation of OsGAPDH transcripts
    + Tissue-specific expression of OsGAPDH indicated that the high level of mRNA was detected in the panicle
    + Cytosolic Oryza sativa glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OsGAPDH), the enzyme involved in the ubiquitous glycolysis, catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (BPG) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as an electron acceptor
    + NAD binds to each OsGAPDH subunits with some residues forming positively charged grooves that attract sulfate anions, as a simulation of phosphate groups in the product BPG
    + One of the clones, OsGAPDH, represented a gene that was expressed at high level during 12-h submergence
    + Molecular cloning, characterization, expression and chromosomal location of OsGAPDH, a submergence responsive gene in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)
