* **Key message**  
    + Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium
    + Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.
    + Stress response of OsETHE1 is altered in response to light and dark conditions.
    + To this end, we show that the stress response of OsETHE1 is dependent on light and that darkness largely suppresses the stress response of this gene
