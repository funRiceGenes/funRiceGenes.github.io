    + OsGRP3 Enhances Drought Resistance by Altering Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Pathway in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Then, the drought tolerance tests of transgenic plants confirmed that OsGRP3 enhanced drought resistance in rice
    + Herein, our findings suggested that OsGRP3 enhanced drought resistance in rice by altering the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and further increasing lignin accumulation
    + The expression of OsGRP3 was shown to be induced by several abiotic stress treatments and phytohormone treatments
    + Subsequently, the RNA-seq analysis, physiological experiments and histochemical staining showed that OsGRP3 influenced the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and further modulated lignin accumulation
