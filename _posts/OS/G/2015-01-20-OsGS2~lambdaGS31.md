## Expression information

## Key message
1. __drought tolerance__, [Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  Results suggest that OsGS2 and OsGS1;1 expression may contribute to drought tolerance of Khitish cultivar under WD conditions
2. __salt stress__, [Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves
3. __salt stress__, [Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  This might influence photorespiration process, reduce NH4+ production from photorespiration, and immediately down-regulate the expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves of salt stressed rice"
4. __drought__, [Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 were differentially regulated in IR-64 (drought-sensitive) and Khitish (drought-tolerant) cultivars of rice

6. __chloroplast__, [Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice plants possess one gene (OsGS2) for chloroplastic GS2 and three genes (OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2 and OsGS1;3) for cytosolic GS1
7. __salt__, [Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves
