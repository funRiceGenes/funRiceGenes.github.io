* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that osg1l1 and osg1l2 loss-of-function CRISPR mutants have similar phenotypes to the phenotype of the previously published taw1 mutant, suggesting that these genes might act on related pathways during inflorescence development
    + Transcriptome analysis of the osg1l2 mutant suggested interactions of OsG1L2 with other known inflorescence architecture regulators and the data sets were used for the construction of a gene regulatory network (GRN), proposing interactions among genes potentially involved in controlling inflorescence development in rice
