## Key message
1. __cell cycle__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, analysis of mil1 msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of MIL1, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to mil1
2. __pollen__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice Oryza sativa gene, MICROSPORELESS1 MIL1)  
3. __fertility__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility
4. __microspore__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice Oryza sativa gene, MICROSPORELESS1 MIL1)  
5. __microspore__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility
6. __microspore__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores
7. __meiotic__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores

10. __meiosis__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice Oryza sativa gene, MICROSPORELESS1 MIL1)  
11. __anther__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility

15. __transcription factor__, [Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin%5BTitle%5D),  MIL1 encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin, which could interact with TGA transcription factors
