* **Key message**  
    + While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
    + Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints
    + Here, we report that OsGRF7 shapes plant architecture via the regulation of auxin and gibberellin metabolism in rice
    + Further analysis indicated that OsGRF7 binds the ACRGDA motif in the promoters of Cytochrome P450 gene (OsCYP714B1) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12), which are involved in the gibberellin synthesis and auxin signaling pathways, respectively
    + Knock-out and knock-down lines of OsGRF7 exhibit contrasting phenotypes with severe degradation of parenchymal cells in the culm and lamina joints at maturity
    + These findings establish OsGRF7 as a crucial component in the OsmiR396-OsGRF-plant hormone regulatory network that controls rice plant architecture
    + OsGRF7 is mainly expressed in lamina joints, nodes, internodes, axillary buds, and young inflorescences
    + The OsGRF7 has recently been shown involving in modulating leaf angle through regulating GA and IAA metabolism
    + These findings unveil a novel function of OsGRF7 in rice tillering determination
    + Interestingly, we found that OsGRF7 negatively regulates the tiller number
    + However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of OsGRF7 underlying the tiller number determination are still not understood
    + Here, we report that OsGRF7 directly targets the promoter of the NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY2 (OsNSP2), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis
    + Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the expression level of OsNSP2 and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds
