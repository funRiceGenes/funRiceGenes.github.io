* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsSKIPa exhibited significantly improved growth performance in the medium containing stress agents (abscisic acid, salt, or mannitol) and drought resistance at both the seedling and reproductive stages
    + Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice
    + The expression OsSKIPa is induced by various abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments
    + Suppression of OsSKIPa in rice resulted in growth arrest and reduced cell viability
    + The OsSKIPa-overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress-related genes, including SNAC1 and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions
