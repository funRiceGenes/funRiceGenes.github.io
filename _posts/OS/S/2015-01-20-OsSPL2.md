* **Key message**  
    + The results suggested that H(2) O(2) accumulation in rice suppresses the expression of miR156, and induces the expression of its target genes, OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b, whose proteins interact in the nucleus to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which is involved in plant defense
