* **Key message**  
    + OsSIRH2-14 expression was induced in root and shoot tissues treated with NaCl
    + Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) RING H2-type E3 ligase, OsSIRH2-14 (previously named OsRFPH2-14), which plays a positive role in salinity tolerance by regulating salt-related proteins including an HKT-type Na+ transporter (OsHKT2;1)
    + These results suggest that the OsSIRH2-14 RING E3 ligase positively regulates the salinity stress response by modulating the stability of salt-related proteins
