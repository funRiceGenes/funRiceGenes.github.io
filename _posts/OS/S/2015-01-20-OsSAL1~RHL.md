## Connection
1. __OsCR4__, __OsSAL1~RHL__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
2. __ADL1~OsDEK1__, __OsSAL1~RHL__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
3. __OsSAL1~RHL__, __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
4. __OsSAL1~RHL__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
