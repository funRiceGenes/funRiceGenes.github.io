* **Key message**  
    + OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.
    + Overexpression of OsSYP121 in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to blast
    + The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast
    + Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice blast resistance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking
    + OsSYP121 is plasma membrane-localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-resistant rice landrace Hei (Heikezijing) and the blast-susceptible landrace Su (Suyunuo)
    + However, knockdown of OsSYP121 expression in the resistant cultivar Hei resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus
