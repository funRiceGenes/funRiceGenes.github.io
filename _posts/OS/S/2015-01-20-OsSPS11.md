    + __OsSPS11__, __sps1~SPS~OsSPS1__, [The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose%5BTitle%5D), To examine whether the promoters of OsSPSs can be controlled by sugars and circadian clock, we produced transgenic rice plants harboring a promoter-luciferase construct for OsSPS1 or OsSPS11 and analyzed the changes in the promoter activities by monitoring bioluminescence from intact transgenic plants in real-time
    + __OsSPS11__, __sps1~SPS~OsSPS1__, [The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose%5BTitle%5D), Under the light-dark cycle, both OsSPS1 and OsSPS11 promoter activities were low in the dark and increased rapidly after the beginning of the light period
    + __OsSPS11__, __sps1~SPS~OsSPS1__, [The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose%5BTitle%5D), When the transgenic rice plants were moved to the continuous light condition, both P OsSPS1 ::LUC and P OsSPS11 ::LUC reporter plants exhibited circadian bioluminescence rhythms; bioluminescence peaked during the subjective day with a 27-h period: in the early morning as for OsSPS1 promoter and midday for OsSPS11 promoter
    + __OsSPS11__, __sps1~SPS~OsSPS1__, [The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose%5BTitle%5D), The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose
    + __OsSPS11__, __sps1~SPS~OsSPS1__, [A reduction of sucrose phosphate synthase SPS activity affects sucrose/starch ratio in leaves but does not inhibit normal plant growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A reduction of sucrose phosphate synthase SPS activity affects sucrose/starch ratio in leaves but does not inhibit normal plant growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D), In a double knockout mutant of OsSPS1 and OsSPS11 (sps1/sps11), an 84% reduction in leaf SPS activity resulted in higher starch accumulation in the leaves than in the wild-type leaves
    + __OsSAC1__, __OsSPS11__, [Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.%5BTitle%5D),  Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
