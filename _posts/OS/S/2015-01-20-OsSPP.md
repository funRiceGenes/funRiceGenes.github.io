## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
2. __shoot__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D),  OsSPPs are located in both the undifferentiated cells, and the early differentiated cells at the shoot apex
3. __panicle__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
4. __vegetative__, [Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Signal peptide peptidases are expressed in the shoot apex of rice, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization showed that OsSPPs were strongly expressed in vegetative shoot apex, young panicle, developing panicle, and the early developing florets
