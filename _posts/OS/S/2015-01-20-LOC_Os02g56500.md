* **Key message**  
    + To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts
    + H(+) flux measurements using Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) indicated that the transgenic OsSEC24 tobacco and rice enhanced H(+) efflux under iron deficiency
    + Together, OsSEC24 vesicles, along with PM-H(+)-ATPases stimulate roots formation under iron deficiency by enhancing rhizosphere acidification
    + Conversely, the application of plasma membrane PM-H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate elucidated that H(+) secretion increased by OsSEC24 was mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase
