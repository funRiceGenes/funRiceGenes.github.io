* **Key message**  
    + * Transcript analyses revealed that members of the SPX-MFS family were mainly expressed in the shoots, with OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS3 being suppressed by Pi deficiency, while OsSPX-MFS2 was induced
    + We conclude that OsSPX-MFS3 is a low affinity Pi transporter that mediates Pi efflux from the vacuole into cytosol and is coupled to proton movement
    + In contrast to tonoplast localization in plants cells, OsSPX-MFS3 was localised to the plasma membrane when expressed in both yeast and oocytes
    + At high external Pi concentration, OsSPX-MFS3 could partially complement the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant strain EY917 under pH 5
    + In oocytes, OsSPX-MFS3 was shown to facilitate Pi influx or efflux depending on the external pH and Pi concentrations
    + Overexpression of OsSPX-MFS3 results in decreased Pi concentration in the vacuole of rice (Oryza sativa) tissues
