## Key message
1. __salt__, [A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the abl1 mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition"
2. __panicle__, [A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, OsSIPP2C1 expression was increased during the early panicle development
3. __panicle__, [A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice
4. __transcription factor__, [The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
5. __abiotic stress__, [A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice"

7. __drought__, [A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the abl1 mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition"
