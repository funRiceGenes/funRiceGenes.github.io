* **Key message**  
    + In this addendum, we proposed a possible hypothesis that OsSPR1 maintained the mitochondria function to restrict H2O2 production in root apex for normal root development
    + Is Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) the underlying factor for inhibited root growth in Osspr1?
    + The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content
    + * A rice mutant, Oryza sativa short postembryonic roots 1 (Osspr1), has been characterized
    + * Osspr1 mutants exhibited decreased root cell elongation
    + Complementation of the mutant confirmed that OsSPR1 is involved in post-embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in rice
