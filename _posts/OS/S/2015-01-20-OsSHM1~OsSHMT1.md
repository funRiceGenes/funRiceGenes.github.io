* **Key message**  
    + The osshm1 mutant had chlorotic lesions and a considerably smaller, lethal phenotype under natural ambient CO2 concentrations, but could be restored to wild type with normal growth under elevated CO2 levels (0
    + OsSHM1 protein is localized to the mitochondria
    + The data from antioxidant enzymes activity measurement suggested that osshm1 was subjected to significant oxidative stress
