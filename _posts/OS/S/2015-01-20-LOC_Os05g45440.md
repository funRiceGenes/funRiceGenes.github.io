* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsS40-1, OsS40-7, OsS40-12, OsS40-13, and OsS40-14 are senescence-associated genes, involved in the senescence and carbon allocation network by modulating other OsS40 members, SWEET member genes, and senescence-related gene expression
    + Moreover, increased grain size and grain weight occurred in the oss40-1, oss40-12, and oss40-14 lines, while declined grain weight appeared in the oss40-7 and oss40-13 mutants
