* **Key message**  
    + Although mutants of OsSCYL2 showed additional defects in the photosynthetic system, they exhibited enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens
    + Here, we show that mutation of OsSCYL2 in rice gave rise to a novel phenotype-hypersensitive response-like (HR) cell death in a light-dependent manner
    + OsSCYL2 interacted with OsSPL28, subunit of a clathrin-associated adaptor protein that is known to regulate HR-like cell death in rice
