* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic Expression of OsSta2 Enhances Salt Stress Tolerance in Rice.
    + Based on all of these results, we suggest that OsSta2 has important roles in determining yields as well as in conferring tolerance to salt stresses
    + To confirm its role in stress tolerance, we generated transgenic rice that over-expresses OsSta2 under a maize ubiquitin promoter
