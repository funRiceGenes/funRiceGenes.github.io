2. __ALK~SSIIa__, __OsSSIIIa~Flo5__, [Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice Oryza sativa L. uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice Oryza sativa L. uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch%5BTitle%5D),  Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes
