    + SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.
    + OsSWEET11 and 15 are essential for seed filling
    + The accumulation of starch in the pericarp of ossweet11 and ossweet11;15 double mutants supports the critical roles of OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET15 in sucrose translocation and mobilization towards the developing endosperm.
    + Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
    + Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
    + Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice
    + Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of <a6><c2>-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses
    + Notably, the ovaries in the blighted grains of the ossweet15 mutants expanded after flowering but terminated their development before the endosperm cellularization stage and subsequently glucuronidase (GUS) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter lines representing the OsSWEET15 expression showed that the gene was expressed in the endosperm tissues surrounding the embryo, which supposedly supplies nutrients to sustain embryo development
    + These results together with the protein&#x27;s demonstrated sucrose transport capacity and plasma membrane localization suggest that OsSWEET15 plays a prominent role during the caryopsis formation stage, probably by releasing sucrose from the endosperm to support embryo development
    + We show that the knockout of a sugar transporter gene OsSWEET15 led to a significant drop in rice fertility with around half of the knockout mutant&#x27;s spikelets bearing blighted or empty grains
    + By contrast, the empty grains were probably caused by the reduced pollen viability of the ossweet15 mutants
    + These results indicate that both OsSWEET15 and OsSWEET11 play important and similar roles in rice pollen development, caryopsis formation and seed-setting, in addition to their function in seed-filling that was demonstrated previously
