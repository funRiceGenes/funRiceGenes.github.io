    + SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.
    + OsSWEET11 and 15 are essential for seed filling
    + The accumulation of starch in the pericarp of ossweet11 and ossweet11;15 double mutants supports the critical roles of OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET15 in sucrose translocation and mobilization towards the developing endosperm.
    + Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
    + Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
    + Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice
    + Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of β-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses
