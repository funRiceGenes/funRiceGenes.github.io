* **Key message**  
    + We identified OsSWEET11b with roles in male fertility and potential bacterial blight (BB) susceptibility in rice
    + The identification of OsSWEET11b is relevant for fertility and for protecting rice against emerging Xoo strains that target OsSWEET11b
    + However, in contrast with the Arabidopsis homologues, OsSWEET11b did not mediate detectable GA transport
    + oryzae (Xoo) to cause disease, identifying OsSWEET11b as a potential BB susceptibility gene and demonstrating that the induction of host sucrose uniporter activity is key to virulence of Xoo
