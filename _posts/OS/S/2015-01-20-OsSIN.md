## Expression information

## Key message
1. __stem__, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development
2. __dwarf__, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
3. __spikelet__, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
4. __ ga __, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length

6. __sheath__, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
7. __leaf__, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length

## Connection
1. __OsSIN__, __SLR1~OsGAI__, [Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsGAI at protein level was increased in OsSIN-overexpressed rice compared with the wild type
