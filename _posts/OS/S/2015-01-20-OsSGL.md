* **Key message**  
    + Together, our results suggest that OsSGL may regulate stress-tolerance and cell growth by acting via a cytokinin signaling pathway
    + Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield
    + Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced OsSGL expression promoted cell division and grain filling
    + These results suggest that the mechanism by which OsSGL confers enhanced drought tolerance is due to the modulated expression of stress-responsive genes, higher accumulations of osmolytes, and enlarged root systems
    + We investigated OsSGL (Oryza sativa Stress tolerance and Grain Length), a novel DUF1645 domain-containing protein from rice
    + Transgenic plants over-expressing or hetero-expressing OsSGL conferred significantly improved drought tolerance in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively
    + OsSGL was up-regulated by multiple stresses and localized to the nucleus
