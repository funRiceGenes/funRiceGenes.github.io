* **Key message**  
    + Together, our results suggest that OsSGL may regulate stress-tolerance and cell growth by acting via a cytokinin signaling pathway
    + Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield
    + Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced OsSGL expression promoted cell division and grain filling
    + These results suggest that the mechanism by which OsSGL confers enhanced drought tolerance is due to the modulated expression of stress-responsive genes, higher accumulations of osmolytes, and enlarged root systems
    + We investigated OsSGL (Oryza sativa Stress tolerance and Grain Length), a novel DUF1645 domain-containing protein from rice
    + Transgenic plants over-expressing or hetero-expressing OsSGL conferred significantly improved drought tolerance in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively
    + OsSGL was up-regulated by multiple stresses and localized to the nucleus
    + Transcription factor OsSGL is a regulator of starch synthesis and grain quality in rice.
    + Therefore, our findings demonstrate that accurate control of OsSGL homeostasis is essential for starch synthesis and grain quality
    + In addition, we revealed the molecular mechanism of OsSGL in regulating starch biosynthesis-related genes, which are required for grain quality
    + Overexpression of OsSGL reduced total starch and amylose content in the endosperm compared with the wild type
    + Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq analyses indicated that OsSGL targets the transcriptional activity of several starch and sucrose metabolism genes
    + Unexpectedly, our results also show that knock down and mutation of OsSGL disrupts the starch biosynthetic pathway, causing lower starch and amylose content
    + In addition, ChIP-qPCR, yeast one-hybrid, EMSA and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that OsSGL directly inhibits the expression of SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 (OsSUS1) in the endosperm
