* **Key message**  
    + We previously showed that transcripts of OsSIG1, which encodes one such sigma factor in rice, accumulate relatively late during leaf development
    + Quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analyses of chloroplast gene expression revealed that the abundance of transcripts derived from the psaA operon was markedly reduced in OsSIG1-/- plants compared with that in wild-type homozygotes
    + Our results thus indicate that OsSIG1 plays an important role in the maintenance of photosynthetic activity in mature chloroplasts of rice by regulating expression of chloroplast genes for components of photosystem I
    + Gene expression analysis revealed that the OsSIG2A transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1
