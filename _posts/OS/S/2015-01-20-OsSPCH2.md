* **Key message**  
    + Another work indicated that OsSPCH2 controls the initiation of stomatal files in rice (Liu et al., 2009)
    + These results indicated that OsSPCH1 and OsSPCH2 redundantly controlled stomatal initiation and meristemoid fate and that OsSPCH2 plays a major role in this process.
