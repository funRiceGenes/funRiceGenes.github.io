* **Key message**  
    + OsSIK1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsSIK1 is expressed mainly in the stem and spikelet in rice
    + These results indicate that OsSIK1 plays important roles in salt and drought stress tolerance in rice, through the activation of the antioxidative system
    + We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice
    + The expression of OsSIK1 is mainly induced by salt, drought and H(2)O(2) treatments
    + Transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsSIK1 show higher tolerance to salt and drought stresses than control plants
    + Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants
