* **Key message**  
    + OsSNDP3 encodes Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein and localizes in the nucleus and the microdomains of the plasma membrane in tobacco leaf epidermis cells
    + OsSNDP3 Functions for the Polar Tip Growth in Rice Pollen Together with OsSNDP2, a Paralog of OsSNDP3.
    + Gene Ontology analysis using downregulated genes in ossndp3 indicated that the expression of genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol metabolic process and tip growth was significantly altered in ossndp3
    + OsSNDP3 aids pollen polar tip growth by binding with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
    + We can better understand the roles of phosphoinositides during pollen tube growth by studying the functions of OsSNDP3 and OsSNDP2
    + And downregulated genes in ossndp3 might be useful targets for future research on polar tip growth
    + We discovered that OsSNDP3 plays a significant role in pollen tube germination using CRISPR/Cas9 systems, whereas another pollen-preferential Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, OsSNDP2, additively functions with OsSNDP3 during pollen tube germination
