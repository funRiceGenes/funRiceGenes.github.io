* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSDG721 showed saline-alkaline stress-tolerant phenotypes, along with increased leaf angle, advanced heading and ripening dates
    + By contrast, ossdg721 loss-of-function mutants showed increased sensitivity to saline-alkaline stress characterized by decreased survival rates and reduction in plant height, grain size, grain weight and leaf angle
    + Furthermore, we showed that OsSDG721 binds to and deposits the H3K4me3 mark in the promoter and coding region of OsHKT1;5, thereby upregulating OsHKT1;5 expression under saline-alkaline stress
    + Overall, by generating Kitaake activation-tagging pools, we established that the H3K4 methyltransferase OsSDG721 enhances saline-alkaline stress tolerance in rice
    + RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of wild-type Kitaake and ossdg721 mutants indicated that OsSDG721 positively regulates the expression level of HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K+ ) TRANSPORTER1;5 (OsHKT1;5), which encodes a Na+ -selective transporter that maintains K+ /Na+ homeostasis under salt stress
    + Here, we report that SDG721 (SET-domain group protein 721) and SDG705 are involved in regulating rice development
    + Together, these results suggest that SDG721 and SDG705 regulate H3K4 methylation, which is crucial for plant development in rice
    + Loss of SDG721 and SDG705 function resulted in GA-deficient phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, reduced cell length, and reduced panicle branching
    + The transcripts levels and H3K4me3 levels of GA biosynthesis genes and GA signaling pathway genes were downregulated in the sdg721 sdg705 plants
