* **Key message**  
    + OsSTRL2 knockout mutant resulted to male sterility because of the defects in anther development and pollen wall formation
    + Therefore, OsSTRL2 is an atypical strictosidine synthase that plays crucial roles in regulating anther development and pollen wall formation in rice
    + Tissue-specific expression profile analysis, β-glucuronidase histochemical (GUS) staining and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed that OsSTRL2 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and microspores

    + __OsSTRL2__, __STR1__, [An atypical strictosidine synthase, OsSTRL2, plays key roles in anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical strictosidine synthase, OsSTRL2, plays key roles in anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Comparative protein sequence analysis indicated that OsSTRL2 lacked the key catalytic residue found in a typical STR (STR1), although it possessed conserved β-propellers and α-helices formed the basic structure of STR1
