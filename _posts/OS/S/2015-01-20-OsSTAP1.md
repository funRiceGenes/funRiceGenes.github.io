* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of the Transcription Factor Gene OsSTAP1 Increases Salt Tolerance in Rice
    + Compared with wild type, transgenic lines overexpressing OsSTAP1 exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress with higher SOD, POD, and CAT activities, and lower Na+/K+ ratios in the shoots
    + Conclusion: This study suggests that OsSTAP1 functions as an AP2/ERF transcriptional activator, and plays a positive role in salt tolerance by decreasing the Na+/K+ ratio and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis
    + OsSTAP1 is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator in plant cells
