* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsSLRL2  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os05g49930](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g49930)

* **Publication**  
    + [Overproduction of OsSLRL2 alters the development of transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overproduction of OsSLRL2 alters the development of transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D), 2007, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + So we could determine that OsSLRL2 specially expressed in the developing embryo

* **Connection**  
    + __OsSLRL2__, __SLR1~OsGAI__, [Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice%5BTitle%5D), SLRL1 and SLRL2 contain regions with high similarity to the C-terminal conserved domains in SLR1, but lack the N-terminal conserved region of the DELLA proteins
    + __OsJAZ9~OsTIFY11a__, __OsSLRL2__, [Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2.
