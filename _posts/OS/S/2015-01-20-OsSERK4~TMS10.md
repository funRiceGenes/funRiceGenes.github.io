* **Key message**  
    + Here we report the identification of two rice leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, Thermo-Sensitive Genic Male Sterile 10 (TMS10) and its close homolog TMS10-Like (TMS10L), which redundantly function in the maintenance of the tapetal cell layer and microspore/pollen viability under normal temperature conditions with TMS10 playing an essential role in higher temperatures (namely, 28 Â°C)
    + These findings demonstrate that TMS10 and TMS10L act as a key switch in postmeiotic tapetal development and pollen development by buffering environmental temperature changes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms by which plants develop phenotypic plasticity via genotype-environment temperature interaction
    + tms10 displays male sterility under high temperatures but male fertility under low temperatures, and the tms10 tms10l double mutant shows complete male sterility under both high and low temperatures
    + TMS10 may be used as a genetic resource for the development of hybrid seed production systems in crops
    + Biochemical and genetic assays indicate that the kinase activity conferred by the intracellular domain of TMS10 is essential for tapetal degeneration and male fertility under high temperatures
