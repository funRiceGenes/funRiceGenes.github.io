## Key message
1. __seed__, [Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.%5BTitle%5D),  Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem
2. __phloem__, [Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.%5BTitle%5D),  Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem
