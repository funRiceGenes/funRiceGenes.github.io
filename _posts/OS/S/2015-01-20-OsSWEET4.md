* **Key message**  
    + Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem
    + Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
    + GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2
