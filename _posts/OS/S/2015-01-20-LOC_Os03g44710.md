* **Key message**  
    + The function of the rice ortholog (OsSh1) was subsequently validated with a shattering-resistant mutant, and two maize orthologs (ZmSh1-1 and ZmSh1-5
    + Whole-genome mutation analysis of 'Minamiyutaka' newly identified a 13-bp deletion causing defective splicing in exon 3 of the OsSh1 gene which has previously been referred to as a candidate for controlling seed shattering
    + Nucleotide diversity analysis of OsSh1 in wild rice accessions and cultivars revealed that OsSh1 has been under strong selection during rice domestication, and a missense mutation might have contributed to the reduction of seed shattering from the wild progenitors to cultivated rice

* **Connection**  
    + __OsSh1__, __qSH1~RIL1__, [Direct identification of a mutation in OsSh1 causing non-shattering in a rice Oryza sativa L. mutant cultivar using whole-genome resequencing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Direct identification of a mutation in OsSh1 causing non-shattering in a rice Oryza sativa L. mutant cultivar using whole-genome resequencing%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, gene expression analysis suggests that OsSh1 may function downstream of qSH1, a known key gene involved in abscission zone differentiation
