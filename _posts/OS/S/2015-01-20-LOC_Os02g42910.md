* **Key message**  
    + Our results suggest that OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for rice fertilization and CO formation, possibly by stabilizing the recombinant intermediates during meiosis
    + Osshoc1 was sterile both in male and female gametophytes, and it showed a striking reduction in the number of meiotic COs, indicating that OsSHOC1 was required for normal CO formation
    + Further investigations showed that OsSHOC1 physically interacted with OsPTD1 and that the latter was also required for normal CO formation and plant fertility
    + OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.
