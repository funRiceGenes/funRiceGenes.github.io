* **Key message**  
    + Rice lines overexpressing OsSAUR45 displayed pleiotropic developmental defects including reduced plant height and primary root length, fewer adventitious roots, narrower leaves, and reduced seed setting
    + This research is the first to demonstrate that OsSAUR45 is involved in plant growth though affecting auxin synthesis and transport by repressing OsYUCCA and OsPIN gene expression in rice
    + These results demonstrate that OsSAUR45 is involved in plant growth by affecting auxin synthesis and transport through the repression of OsYUCCA and OsPIN gene expression in rice
    + The small auxin-up RNA OsSAUR45 affects auxin synthesis and transport in rice.
    + Auxin levels and transport were reduced in the OsSAUR45 overexpression lines, potentially because of decreased expression of Flavin-binding monooxygenase family proteins (OsYUCCAs) and PIN-FORMED family proteins (OsPINs)
    + Exogenous auxin application rapidly induced OsSAUR45 expression and partially restored the phenotype of rice lines overexpressing OsSAUR45
    + OsSAUR45 is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern and is localized to the cytoplasm
