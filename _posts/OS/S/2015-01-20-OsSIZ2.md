* **Key message**  
    + In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2
    + Although the relative expression of OsSIZ2 was spatiotemporally regulated, it showed constitutive expression in root and leaf blade irrespective of Pi regime
    + Further, attenuation in the expression levels of OsSIZ2 in the roots of ossiz1 and relatively similar trend of the effects of the mutation in OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 on growth and development and total P concentration in different tissues suggested a prevalence of partial functional redundancy between these paralogs
    + OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.
    + OsSIZ2 regulates nitrogen homeostasis and some of the reproductive traits in rice.
    + Under -N condition, total N concentration in the root of OsSIZ2-Ri plants and ossiz2 was significantly increased compared with wild type
    + In addition, ossiz2 indicated obvious defects in anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed set percentage
    + Overall, these results suggest pivotal roles of OsSIZ2 in regulating homeostasis of N and different agronomic traits including anther and seed development
    + Moreover, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that several genes involved in the maintenance of N homeostasis were altered in OsSIZ2 mutants
