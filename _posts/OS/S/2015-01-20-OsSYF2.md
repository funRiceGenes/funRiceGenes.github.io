* **Key message**  
    + A Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 Interacts with OsSYF2 to Regulate Grain Length by Pre-mRNA Splicing.
    + The phenotypes of transgenic lines indicated that OsSYF2 positively regulates grain length via its influence on cell expansion
    + Transcriptomic analysis showed that OsSYF2 controls the expression and pre-mRNA alternative splicing of genes involved in sugar metabolism
