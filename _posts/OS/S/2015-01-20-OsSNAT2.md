* **Key message**  
    + The Km and Vmax values of the purified recombinant OsSNAT2 were 371 μm and 4,700 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively; the enzyme's optimal activity temperature was 45°C
    + Confocal microscopy showed that the OsSNAT2 protein was localized to both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts
    + The OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 transcripts were similarly suppressed in rice leaves during the melatonin induction after cadmium treatment
