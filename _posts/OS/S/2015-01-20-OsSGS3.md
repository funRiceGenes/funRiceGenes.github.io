* **Connection**  
    + __OsRDR6~shl-2__, __OsSGS3__, [p2 of rice stripe virus RSV interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=p2 of rice stripe virus RSV interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor%5BTitle%5D), SGS3 has been shown to be involved in sense transgene-induced RNA silencing and in the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), possibly functioning as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)
