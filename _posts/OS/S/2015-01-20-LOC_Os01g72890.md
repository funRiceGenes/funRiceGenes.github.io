* **Publication**  
    + [OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that OsFKBP20-1b, belonging to the immunophilin family, interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 in both nuclear speckles and cytoplasmic foci and plays an essential role in post-transcriptional regulation of abiotic stress response
    + OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.

    + __OsFKBP20-1b__, __OsSR45__, [Nuclear OsFKBP20-1b maintains SR34 stability and promotes the splicing of retained introns upon ABA exposure in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Nuclear OsFKBP20-1b maintains SR34 stability and promotes the splicing of retained introns upon ABA exposure in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We also analyzed whether OsFKBP20-1b and the splicing factors OsSR34 and OsSR45 function together in AS using protoplast transfection assays
