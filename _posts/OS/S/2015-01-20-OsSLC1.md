    + OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.
    + Loss-of-function of OsSLC1 affected the intron splicing of multiple group II introns, and especially precluded the intron splicing of rps16, and resulted in significant increase in the transcript levels of 3 chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and 16 chloroplast development-related and photosynthesis-related genes, and in significant reduction in the transcript levels of 1 chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and 2 chloroplast development-related and photosynthesis-related genes
    + Map-based cloning of OsSLC1 revealed that a single base (G) deletion was detected in the first exon of Os06g0710800 in the slc1 mutant, which caused a premature stop codon
    + OsSLC1 was preferentially expressed in green leaves, and encoded a chloroplast-localized PPR protein harboring 12 PPR motifs
