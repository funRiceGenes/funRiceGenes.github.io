## Connection
1. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  An SGR homologue, SGR-like SGRL), has been detected in many plant species
2. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence
3. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases
4. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice
5. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation
6. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed
7. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D), The Stay-Green Rice like SGRL gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice
