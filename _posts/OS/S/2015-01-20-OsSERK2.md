1. __OsBISERK1~OsSERK1~OsBAK1__, __OsSERK2__, [Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family
2. __OsFLS2__, __OsSERK2__, [An XA21-associated kinase OsSERK2 regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An XA21-associated kinase OsSERK2 regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2 and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 OsFLS2)  
3. __OsFLS2__, __OsSERK2__, [An XA21-associated kinase OsSERK2 regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An XA21-associated kinase OsSERK2 regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR
