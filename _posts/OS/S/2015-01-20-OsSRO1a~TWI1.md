    + OsSRO1a Interacts with RNA Binding Domain-Containing Protein (OsRBD1) and Functions in Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Yeast.
    + Further, co-transformation of both OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 in yeast conferred enhanced tolerance toward salinity, osmotic, and methylglyoxal treatments
    + Our study suggests that the interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 confers enhanced stress tolerance in yeast and may play an important role under abiotic stress responses in plants
    + Transcript profiling under different stress conditions revealed co-regulation of OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 expression under some abiotic stress conditions
    + TWI1 regulates cell-to-cell movement of OSH15 to control leaf cell fate.
    + Knockout or knockdown of OSH15 in twi1 rescues the twisted leaf phenotype
    + TWI1 encodes a transcription factor binding protein that interacts with OSH15, a class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor
    + Mutant twi1 plants have twisted leaves which might be caused by the compromised development and disordered patterning of bundle sheath, sclerenchyma and interveinal mesophyll cells
    + OsSRO1a also interacted with OsMYC2, a positive transcription factor in JA signaling, in both plant and yeast cells
    + The expression of OsSRO1a was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment
    + These results suggest that OsSRO1a is a negative regulator of the OsMYC2-mediated JA signaling pathway in rice
