* **Key message**  
    + Heterogeneous overexpression of OsSIRP1 in Arabidopsis reduced tolerance for salinity stress during seed germination and root growth
    + Our findings indicate that OsSIRP1 acts as a negative regulator of salinity stress tolerance mediated by the ubiquitin 26S proteasome system
    + Transcript levels of OsSIRP1 in rice leaves after various stress treatments, including salt, heat, drought, and hormone (ABA), were observed
