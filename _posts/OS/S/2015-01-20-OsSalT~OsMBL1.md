* **Key message**  
    + Expression of various brassinosteroids (OsBRI1, OsDWF4) and salt (SalT) responsive genes, revealed the down regulation of OsDWF4 with application of EBL and upregulation of SalT in presence of salt stress thereby confirming the efficacy of the treatments
    + salT mRNA accumulates very rapidly in sheaths and roots from mature plants and seedlings upon treatment with Murashige and Skoog salts (1%), air drying, abscisic acid (20 microM), polyethylene glycol (5%), sodium chloride (1%), and potassium chloride (1%)
    + Interestingly, a significant down regulation of SalT gene was observed on application of EBL along with salt compared to salt treatment alone
    + On the other hand, the application of EBL alone and in combination with salt has resulted in upregulation of OsBRI1
    + 8% homology to the salT gene, and clones SI1 and SR3 show 88
    + The organ-specific response of salT is correlatable with the pattern of Na+ accumulation during salt stress
    + Using an oligonucleotide probe based on this information, a cDNA clone, salT, was selected and found to contain an open reading frame coding for a protein of 145 amino acid residues
    + Overexpression of OsMBL1 led to activation of rice defense responsive genes and a chitin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, thereby enhancing resistance to M
