* **Key message**  
    + OsSPL might form homodimers and interact with TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factor OsTCP5 via the SPL dimerization and TCP interaction domain
    + We showed that meiosis-specific callose deposition, chromatin organization, and centromere-specific histone H3 loading were altered in the cells corresponding to pollen mother cells in Osspl anthers
    + Global transcriptome analysis showed that the enriched differentially expressed genes in Osspl were mainly related to redox status, meiotic process, and parietal cell development
    + We performed a large-scale genetic screen of rice sterile mutants aimed to identify genes regulating meiotic entry and identified OsSPL using map-based cloning
    + OsSPL regulates meiotic fate acquisition in rice.
