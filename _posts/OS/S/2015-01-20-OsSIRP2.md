* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsSIRP2 conferred salinity and osmotic stress tolerance in plants
    + Heterogeneous overexpression of OsSIRP2 resulted in conferring tolerance against salinity and osmotic stress
    + Overall, our findings suggest that OsSIRP2 may be associated with plant responses to abiotic stresses and act as a positive regulator of salt and osmotic stress tolerance
    + The transcript levels of OsSIRP2 in rice leaves were induced in response to different abiotic stresses, such as salt, drought, heat, and abscisic acid (ABA) exposure
