* **Key message**  
    + Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed
    + Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
    + The over expression of OsTOP6A1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants driven by cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development
    + OsTOP6A1 was predominantly expressed in prepollinated flowers
    + Although AtSPO11-1, the homolog of OsTOP6A1 in Arabidopsis, has been implicated in meiotic recombination; the present study demonstrates possible additional role of OsTOP6A1 and provides an effective tool for engineering crop plants for tolerance to different environmental stresses
    + Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants
    + Thus, OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice

    + __OsATM__, __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, [OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Aberrant chromosome associations disappeared in Osspo11-1 Osatm-1 double mutants and more severe defects were observed in Osdmc1  Osatm, suggesting that OsATM functions downstream of OsSPO11-1-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB) formation and in parallel with OsDMC1-mediated homologous recombination
    + __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, __OsSUN1__, [The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 Ossun2 mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 Ossun2-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1
    + __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, __OsSUN2__, [The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 Ossun2 mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 Ossun2-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and OsSUN2 promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1

    + __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, __TOP6A2~OsTOP6A2~OsSPO11-2__, [Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Similar to Osspo11-1, biallelic mutations in OsSPO11-2 first exon led to complete panicle sterility, and consequently, none of these primary transformants produced seeds
    + __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, __TOP6A2~OsTOP6A2~OsSPO11-2__, [Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Similar to Osspo11-1, the pollen mother cells of Osspo11-2 T1 progeny plants, showed an absence of bivalent formation at metaphase I, aberrant segregation of homologous chromosomes and formation of nonviable tetrads
    + __OsSPO11-1~OsTOP6A1__, __TOP6A2~OsTOP6A2~OsSPO11-2__, [Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Assessment of the roles of OsSPO11-2 and OsSPO11-4 in rice meiosis using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Altogether, this study demonstrates that whereas OsSPO11-1 and OsSPO11-2 are the likely orthologs of Arabidopsis AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, the additional OsSPO11-4 gene has no major role in wild-type rice meiosis
