* **Key message**  
    + The rice OsSAG12-2 gene codes for a functional protease that negatively regulates stress-induced cell death.
    + Down-regulation of OsSAG12-2 in the transgenic artificial miRNA lines results in enhanced salt- and UV-induced cell death, even though it does not affect cell viability in the stress-free condition
    + Our results show that OsSAG12-2 codes for a functional protease that negatively regulates stress-induced cell death in rice
    + Dark-induced senescence activates OsSAG12-2 expression
