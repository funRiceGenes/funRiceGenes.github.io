* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we isolated a NAC family transcription factor (TF), OsSND2 through yeast one-hybrid screening using the secondary wall NAC-binding element (SNBE) on the promoter region of OsMYB61 which is known transcription factor for regulation of SCWs biosynthesis as bait
    + Overexpression of OsSND2 resulted in rolled leaf, increased cellulose content and up-regulated expression of SCWs related genes
    + The knockout of OsSND2 using CRISPR/Cas9 system decreased cellulose content and down-regulated the expression of SCWs related genes
    + OsSND2 was identified as a positive regulator of cellulose biosynthesis in rice
    + Therefore, the study of the function of OsSND2 can provide a strategy for manipulating plant biomass production
