    + OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.
    + Here, we demonstrate that the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase OsSLA1 plays an important role in leaf angle regulation in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + OsSLA1 mutant plants exhibited a small leaf angle phenotype due to changes of adaxial cells in the lamina joint
    + These results demonstrate that OsSLA1 regulates leaf angle formation via positive regulation of BR signaling by enhancing the interaction of OsBRI1 with OsBAK1
    + In addition, phosphorylation experiments revealed that OsSLA1 does not possess kinase activity, but that it can be phosphorylated by OsBRI1 in vitro
    + The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked
    + GUS staining revealed that OsSLA1 was highly expressed in adaxial cells of the lamina joint
    + Fluorescence microscopy showed that OsSLA1 was localized to the plasma membrane and nearby periplasmic vesicles
