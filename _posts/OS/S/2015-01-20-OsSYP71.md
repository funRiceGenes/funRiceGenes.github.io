* **Key message**  
    + OsSYP71 is an oxidative stress and rice blast response gene that encodes a Qc-SNARE protein in rice
    + Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild-type plants
    + These results indicate that Qc-SNAREs play an important role in rice response to environmental stresses, and OsSYP71 is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast
    + Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
