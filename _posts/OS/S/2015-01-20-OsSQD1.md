* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression analysis showed that OsSQD1 is located in the chloroplast
    + The inhibitory effects of the OsSQD1 mutation were also evident in the development of reproductive tissue
    + Furthermore, OsSQD1 differently affects lipid composition under different Pi regime affects sulfur (S) homeostasis
    + OsSQD1 at the crossroads of phosphate and sulfur metabolism affects plant morphology and lipid composition in response to phosphate deprivation.
    + Together, the study revealed that OsSQD1 affects Pi and S homeostasis, and lipid composition in response to Pi deprivation
