* **Key message**  
    + OsSAP was both highly and rapidly expressed in response to drought stress
    + Identification of a drought-induced rice gene, OsSAP, that suppresses Bax-induced cell death in yeast
    + Additionally, OsSAP was found to be localized to the mitochondria
    + sativa cDNA encoding R12H780 was a highly conserved putative senescence-associated-protein (OsSAP)
