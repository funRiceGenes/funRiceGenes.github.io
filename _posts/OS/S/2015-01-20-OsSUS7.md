## Key message
1. __root__, [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane%5BTitle%5D),  RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots

## Connection
1. __OsSUS5__, __OsSUS7__, [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane%5BTitle%5D), Systematic searches using the complete genome sequence of rice Oryza sativa identified OsSUS7, a new member of the rice sucrose synthase OsSUS gene family, which shows only nine single nucleotide substitutions in the OsSUS5 coding sequence
2. __OsSUS5__, __OsSUS7__, [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane%5BTitle%5D),  Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the synteny between OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 is conserved, and that significant numbers of transposable elements are scattered at both loci
3. __OsSUS5__, __OsSUS7__, [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane%5BTitle%5D),  GFP fusion experiments indicated that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 are largely associated with the plasma membrane and partly with the cytosol in maize mesophyll protoplasts

5. __OsSUS5__, __OsSUS7__, [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that two redundant genes, OsSUS5 and OsSUS7, evolved via duplication of a chromosome region and through the transposition of transposable elements
