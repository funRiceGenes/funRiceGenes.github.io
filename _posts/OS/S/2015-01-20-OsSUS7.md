    + [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane%5BTitle%5D), 2011, Mol Cells.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots
