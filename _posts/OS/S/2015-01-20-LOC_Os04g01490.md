* **Key message**  
    + OsSIRP4 is an E3 ligase that acts as a negative regulator in the plant response to salt stress via the 26S proteasomal system regulation of substrate proteins, OsPEX11-1, which it provides important information for adaptation and regulation in rice
    + OsSIRP4 transcripts were highly induced under salt stress in rice
    + Furthermore, qRT data on transgenic plants suggest that OsSIRP4 acted as a negative regulator of salt response by diminishing the expression of genes related to Na+/K+ homeostasis (AtSOS1, AtAKT1, AtNHX1, and AtHKT1;1) in transgenic plants under salt stress
    + These results suggest that OsSIRP4 plays a negative regulatory role in response to salt stress by modulating the target protein levels
