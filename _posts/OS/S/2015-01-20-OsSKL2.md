* **Key message**  
    + Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by OsSKL2 and OsASR1 in Rice.
    + OsSKL2 was localized in the chloroplast, and its transcripts were significantly induced by drought and salinity stress as well as H(2)O(2) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + Meanwhile, overexpression of OsSKL2 in rice increased tolerance to salinity, drought and oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, and reducing levels of H(2)O(2), malondialdehyde, and relative electrolyte leakage
    + Moreover, OsSKL2 was found to physically interact with OsASR1, a well-known chaperone-like protein, which also exhibited positive roles in salt and drought tolerance
    + Taken together, these findings suggest that OsSKL2 together with OsASR1 act as important regulatory factors that confer salt and drought tolerance in rice via ROS scavenging
    + In contrast, RNAi-induced suppression of OsSKL2 increased sensitivity to stress treatment
    + Interestingly, overexpression of OsSKL2 also increased sensitivity to exogenous ABA, with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation
