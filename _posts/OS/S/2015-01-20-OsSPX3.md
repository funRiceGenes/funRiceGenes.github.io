## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsSPX3 downregulates OsSPX5 in shoots under Pi-sufficiency

## Connection
1. __OsSPX3__, __OsSPX5__, [The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPX3 and OsSPX5 (SPX3/5) are paralogous SPX genes ( SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) in cereal crops
2. __OsSPX3__, __OsSPX5__, [The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Similar tissue expression patterns of the two genes and proteins were identified by in situ hybridization and the transgenic plants harbouring SPX3pro-SPX3-GUS or SPX5pro-SPX5-GUS fusions, respectively
3. __OsSPX3__, __OsSPX5__, [The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice
4. __OsSPX1__, __OsSPX3__, [Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein
5. __OsSPX1__, __OsSPX3__, [Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice
6. __LTN1~OsPHO2__, __OsSPX3__, [Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi-starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi-starvation
7. __LTN1~OsPHO2__, __OsSPX3__, [Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2
