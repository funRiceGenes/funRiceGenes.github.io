* **Key message**  
    + Analysis of the OsSUT2 promoter::beta-glucuronidase transgenic rice indicated that this gene is highly expressed in leaf mesophyll cells, emerging lateral roots, pedicels of fertilized spikelets, and cross cell layers of seed coats
    + In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated
    + To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
    + The ossut2 mutant exhibited a growth retardation phenotype with a significant reduction in tiller number, plant height, 1,000-grain weight, and root dry weight compared with the controls, the wild type, and complemented transgenic lines
    + Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination
    + Impaired function of the tonoplast-localized sucrose transporter in rice, OsSUT2, limits the transport of vacuolar reserve sucrose and affects plant growth
    + Two sucrose transporter (SUT) cDNAs, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L
    + The TopPred program suggested that both sucrose transporter proteins, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, consist of potentially 12 transmembrane domains
    + Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z
    + These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
    + In this paper we report the identification, cloning and expression analysis of four putative sucrose transporter (SUT) genes from rice, designated OsSUT2, 3, 4 and 5
    + In situ hybridization analysis showed thatOsSUT2transcript is specific to the developing pollen
    + Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4
    + GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2
