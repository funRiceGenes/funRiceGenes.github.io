## Key message
1. __leaf__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation
2. __root__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In the root tip, OsSCR expression was observed in the endodermal cell layer and downregulated in the daughter cortex cell after asymmetric division, just as with Arabidopsis SCR
3. __stomatal__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation
4. __stomatal__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs
5. __iaa__, [A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos%5BTitle%5D)),  In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation
6. __stomata__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation
7. __stomata__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs
8. __stomata__, [The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on these observations, we proposed that OsSCR is involved not only in the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell but also during stomata and ligule formation by establishing the polarization of cytoplasm
