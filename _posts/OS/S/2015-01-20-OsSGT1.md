* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of the OsSGT1 gene significantly reduced the probenazole-dependent development of resistance against blast disease, further supporting the suggestion that OsSGT1 is a key mediator of development of chemically induced disease resistance
    + Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants
    + Cloning and characterization of the most highly activated probenazole-responsive gene revealed that it encodes UDP-glucose:SA glucosyltransferase (OsSGT1), which catalyzes the conversion of free SA into SA O-beta-glucoside (SAG)
    + The OsSGT1 gene may contribute to the SA signaling mechanism by inducing up-regulation of SAG in rice plants
