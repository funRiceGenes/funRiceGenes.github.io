* **Key message**  
    + We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress
    + Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice.
    + Here, we report that protein kinase OsSAPK8 interacts with and activates OsSLAC1 mainly by phosphorylating serine 129 (S129) of OsSLAC1, and this phosphorylating site corresponds to the specific phosphorylating site serine 120 (S120) of AtSLAC1 for AtOST1
    + The ossapk8 mutants showed lower tolerance to low-temperature, high salinity and drought stresses at the vegetative stages
    + Our results provide evidence for OsSAPK8 acting as a positive regulator in cold, drought, and salt stress responses
    + We further confirmed that the yield was reduced in ossapk8 mutant lines compared with the wild type
    + Rice SnRK protein kinase OsSAPK8 acts as a positive regulator in abiotic stress responses.
