* **Key message**  
    + The results showed that the mutant Ossiz1 exhibited the significant changes in several growth and developmental parameters, including primary root length, adventitious root number, plant height, leaf and panicle length, flower formation, and seed-setting rate compared with wild type
    + The function in the vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice was investigated using OsSIZ1 mutants containing a T-DNA insertion
    + OsSIZ1 Regulates the Vegetative Growth and Reproductive Development in Rice
    + In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2
    + Taking together these results indicate that OsSIZ1 plays an important role in regulating growth and development in rice
    + Pi concentration in the xylem sap of ossiz1 mutants was significantly higher than that of the wild type under a Pi-sufficient growth regime
    + OsSIZ1 is constitutively expressed throughout the vegetative and reproductive growth of rice, with stronger promoter activities in vascular bundles of culms
    + ossiz1 mutants had shorter primary roots and adventitious roots than wild-type plants, suggesting that OsSIZ1 is associated with the regulation of root system architecture
    + Here, we investigated the expression profile of OsSIZ1 in rice using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and pOsSIZ1-GUS transgenic plants, and the function of OsSIZ1 in the responses to phosphate and nitrogen using a reverse genetics approach
    + Total nitrogen (N) concentrations in the most detected tissues of ossiz1 mutants were significantly increased compared with the wild type
    + Total phosphorus (P) and phosphate (Pi) concentrations in both roots and shoots of ossiz1 mutants were significantly increased irrespective of Pi supply conditions compared with the wild type
    + Analysis of mineral contents in ossiz1 mutants indicated that OsSIZ1 functions specifically in Pi and N responses, not those of other nutrients examined, in rice
    + Further, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of multiple genes involved in Pi starvation signaling and N transport and assimilation were altered in ossiz1 mutants
    + Together, these results suggested that OsSIZ1 may act as a regulator of the Pi (N)-dependent responses in rice
    + We report here that overexpression of OsSIZ1 in cotton results in higher net photosynthesis and better growth than wild-type cotton under drought and thermal stresses in growth chamber and greenhouse conditions
    + Overexpression of the Rice SUMO E3 Ligase Gene OsSIZ1 in Cotton Enhances Drought and Heat Tolerance, and Substantially Improves Fiber Yields in the Field under Reduced Irrigation and Rainfed Conditions.
    + In this report, it is demonstrated that over-expression of the rice gene OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis leads to increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses
    + These results demonstrate that the rice gene OsSIZ1 has a great potential to be used for improving crop's tolerance to several abiotic stresses
    + Previous studies showed that overexpression of the Arabidopsis vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase gene AVP1 increases salt and water deficit stress tolerance and overexpression of the rice SUMO E3 ligase gene OsSIZ1 improves heat and water deficit stress tolerance in transgenic plants
    + Co-overexpression of AVP1 and OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis substantially enhances plant tolerance to drought, salt, and heat stresses.
    + In this report, the effects of co-overexpression of AVP1 and OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis on abiotic stress tolerance were studied
