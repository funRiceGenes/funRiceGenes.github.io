* **Key message**  
    + We used one of the candidate genes, OsSPL4, whose function was previously unknown, for gene editing experimental validation of the high yield, and confirmed that OsSPL4 significantly affects panicle branching and increases the rice yield
    + Herein, we report the identification and functional analysis of OsSPL4 in panicle and grain development of rice
    + Cytological analysis showed that OsSPL4 could regulate spikelet development by promoting cell division
    + The Elite Alleles of OsSPL4 Regulate Grain Size and Increase Grain Yield in Rice.
    + Using CRISPR/Cas9 system, two elite alleles of OsSPL4 were obtained, which exhibited an increasing number of grains per panicle and grain size, resulting in increase of rice yield
    + In addition, OsSPL4 could be cleaved by the osa-miR156 in vivo, and the OsmiR156-OsSPL4 module might regulate the grain size in rice
    + Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsSPL4 (OXSPL4) displayed enhanced blast disease resistance accompanied by enhanced the immune responses, including increased expression of defense-relative genes and up-accumulated H(2) O(2)
