* **Key message**  
    + Their stress-inducible expression provided the protection against yield loss in transgenic plants, indicating the agronomic relevance of OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance
    + Functionally, both OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes
    + While the abundance of OsPAP26 transcript is not affected by Pi supply, it is upregulated during leaf senescence
    + Furthermore, Pi deprivation and leaf senescence greatly increased the abundance of OsPAP26 protein
    + Overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) of OsPAP26 in transgenic rice significantly increased or reduced APase activities in leaves, roots and growth medium, respectively
    + Western blot analysis of protein extracts from callus growth medium confirmed that OsPAP26 is a secreted PAP
    + OsPAP26-overexpressing plants were capable of converting more ATP into inorganic Pi in the growth medium, which further supported the potential role of OsPAP26 in utilizing organic P in rhizosphere
    + In summary, we concluded that OsPAP26 perform dual functions in plants: Pi remobilization from senescing to non-senescing leaves and organic P utilization
    + OsPAP26 encodes a major purple acid phosphatase and regulates phosphate remobilization in rice.
