* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that the induction of the OsSAMDC gene in response to cold may be used as a molecular marker for the ability of rice seedlings to withstand exposure to low temperatures
    + We also analyzed the response of OsSAMDC to various abiotic stress treatments and plant hormones
    + Upon exposure to cold stress (5 degrees C) the level of OsSAMDC transcripts in the cold-resistant Yukihikari genotype continued to increase for up to 72 h
