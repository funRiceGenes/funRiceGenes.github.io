    + __OsPIE1__, __OsSPX2__, [A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Further comparative transcriptome analysis, tissue expression patterns and genetic interaction analysis indicated that the enhancing of Pi accumulation and APase activities upon overexpression of OsPIE1 was (at least in part) caused by repression of OsSPX2
