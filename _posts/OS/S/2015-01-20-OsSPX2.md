* **Key message**  
    + Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner
    + Together, our findings demonstrate that OsNAC016 negatively regulates rice phosphate-starvation response and leaf inclination by activating OsSPX2 expression under Pi-starvation conditions
    + Further, we found that Pi starvation enhanced OsNAC016 binding to the OsSPX2 promoter, thus strongly promoting OsSPX2 expression
