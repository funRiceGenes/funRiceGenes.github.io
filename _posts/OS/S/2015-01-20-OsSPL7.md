* **Key message**  
    + Plants over-expressing OsSPL7 had a reduced tiller number, while OsSPL7 RNAi plants had an increased tiller number and a reduced height
    + Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture
    + Heat stress transcription factor OsSPL7 plays a critical role in reactive oxygen species balance and stress responses in rice.
    + osspl7 knockout (spl7ko) mutants showed LM and growth retardation
    + Transgenic rice lines strongly overexpressing OsSPL7 (SPL7OX-S) exhibited LM accompanied by accumulated H2O2, whereas moderate expressers of OsSPL7 (SPL7OX-M) did not, and neither of them exhibited severe growth defects
    + Collectively, our results suggest that OsSPL7 plays a critical role in plant growth and balancing ROS during biotic and abiotic stress
    + Transient expression of OsSPL7-GFP in rice protoplasts indicated that OsSPL7 localizes predominantly in the nucleus
    + Herein, we provide several lines of evidence elucidating the importance of OsSPL7 in maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance via the regulation of downstream gene expression
    + RNA sequencing analyses identified four major groups of differentially expressed genes associated with LM, pathogen resistance, LM-pathogen resistance, and potential direct targets of OsSPL7
