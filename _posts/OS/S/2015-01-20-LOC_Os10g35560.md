* **Key message**  
    + OsSFR6 is an orthologue of AtSFR6, and thus a target for future manipulation to improve tolerance to osmotic and other abiotic stresses
    + Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice
    + We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
    + Strikingly, OsMED16 exhibited an opposite function in plant defense relative to that of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtMED16, most likely because of two amino acid substitutions between the monocot and dicot MED16s tested
    + Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMED16 negatively regulates cell death and immunity in rice, probably via the OsPR3-mediated chitin signaling pathway
    + Furthermore, the ospr3 osmed16 double mutants did not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the spl38 mutant
