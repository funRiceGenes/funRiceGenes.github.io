## Expression information

## Key message
1. __mitosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase
2. __mitosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis
3. __meiotic__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
4. __meiosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase
5. __meiosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II
6. __meiosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis
7. __meiosis__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D), OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis
