* **Key message**  
    + Retransformation of wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that OsSMCP1 is responsible for conferring the salt tolerance
    + It is particularly interesting that R07047 and newly constructed OsSMCP1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance not only to high salinity but also to osmotic, dehydrative, and oxidative stresses
    + Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis
    + For molecular breeding to improve the tolerance of crops against environmental stress, OsSMCP1 is a promising candidate
