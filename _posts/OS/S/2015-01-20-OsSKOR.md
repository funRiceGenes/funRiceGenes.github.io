* **Connection**  
    + __OsNAC2~OsTIL1~OMTN2~OsORE1__, __OsSKOR__, [OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2
    + __OsAKT1__, __OsSKOR__, [Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants
    + __OsHAK1__, __OsSKOR__, [Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants
