* **Key message**  
    + qRTPCR and promoter-GUS analysis showed that OsSKOR is expressed in root vascular tissues, flower, and seed scutellum

* **Connection**  
    + __OsNAC2~OsTIL1~OMTN2~OsORE1__, __OsSKOR__, [OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2
