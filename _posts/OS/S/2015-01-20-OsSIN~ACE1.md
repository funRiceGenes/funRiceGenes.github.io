* **Key message**  
    + Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development
    + Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets
    + The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length
    + Furthermore, an analysis of genetic diversity suggests that mutations in ACE1 and DEC1 have historically contributed to the selection of shorter plants in domesticated populations of rice to increase their resistance to lodging, and of taller plants in wild species of rice for adaptation to growth in deep water
    + We also show that the mechanism of internode elongation that is mediated by ACE1 and DEC1 is conserved in the Gramineae family
