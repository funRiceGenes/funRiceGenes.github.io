* **Key message**  
    + The Ossec3a mutant exhibited enhanced defense responses, as shown by up-regulated transcript levels of pathogenesis- and salicylic acid synthesis-related genes, increased levels of salicylic acid, and enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
    + Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.
    + In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus
    + Disruption of OsSEC3A by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) caused dwarf stature and a lesion-mimic phenotype
    + Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that OsSEC3A has a punctate distribution with the plasma membrane
