* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, OsSPT5-1 interacts with the transcription factor ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) and plays a similar role in regulating the growth of rice shoots
    + Loss-of-function mutants of OsSPT4 and OsSPT5-1 could not be obtained; their heterozygotes showed severe reproductive growth defects
    + RNA sequencing analysis verified that OsSPT5-1 is involved in multiple phytohormone pathways, including gibberellin, auxin, and cytokinin
