* **Key message**  
    + Green fluorescent protein fusion analyses showed that OsSPS1 localized to mitochondria, while OsSPS2 localized to plastids
    + This suggests that OsSPS1 is involved in the supply of solanesyl diphosphate for ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis in mitochondria, whereas OsSPS2 is involved in providing solanesyl diphosphate for plastoquinone-9 formation
    + However, an important biological difference was observed between the two genes: OsSPS1 complemented the yeast coq1 disruptant, which does not form UQ, whereas OsSPS2 only very weakly complemented the growth defect of the coq1 mutant
    + OsSPS1 was highly expressed in root tissue whereas OsSPS2 was found to be high in both leaves and roots

    + __OsFBN5__, __OsSPS2__, [Conserved Function of Fibrillin5 in the Plastoquinone-9 Biosynthetic Pathway in Arabidopsis and Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Conserved Function of Fibrillin5 in the Plastoquinone-9 Biosynthetic Pathway in Arabidopsis and Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Protein interaction experiments in yeast and mesophyll cells confirmed that OsFBN5 interacts with the rice solanesyl diphosphate synthase OsSPS2 and also with Arabidopsis AtSPS1 and AtSPS2
    + __OsFBN1__, __OsSPS2__, [Overexpressing OsFBN1 enhances plastoglobule formation, reduces grain-filling percent and jasmonate levels under heat stress in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpressing OsFBN1 enhances plastoglobule formation, reduces grain-filling percent and jasmonate levels under heat stress in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, overexpressing OsFBN1 affected the transcription levels of OsAOS2 in JA synthesis, OsTHF1, OsABC1K7 and OsPsaE in thylakoid stability and photosynthesis, OsABC1-4 and OsSPS2 in ubiquinone-metabolism, OsHDR, OsDXR, and OsFPPS in isoprenoid metabolism
