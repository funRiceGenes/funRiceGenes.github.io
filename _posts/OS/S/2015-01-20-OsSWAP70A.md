* **Key message**  
    + Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor-induced defense gene expression and ROS production

* **Connection**  
    + __OsSWAP70A__, __OsSWAP70B__, [SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice%5BTitle%5D), Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor-induced defense gene expression and ROS production
    + __OsSWAP70A__, __OsSWAP70B__, [SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we found rice homologs of human SWAP70, Oryza sativa (Os) SWAP70A and SWAP70B, containing the DH domain
    + __OsRac1__, __OsSWAP70A__, [SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses
    + __OsRac1__, __OsSWAP70A__, [SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice%5BTitle%5D), The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF-catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains
    + __OsRac1__, __OsSWAP70A__, [SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice%5BTitle%5D), Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1-mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta
