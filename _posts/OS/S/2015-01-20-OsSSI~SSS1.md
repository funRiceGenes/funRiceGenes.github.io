## Expression information

## Key message
1. __starch__, [Structure, organization, and chromosomal location of the gene encoding a form of rice soluble starch synthase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, organization, and chromosomal location of the gene encoding a form of rice soluble starch synthase%5BTitle%5D), ) genomic clone encoding the gene for a form of soluble starch synthase (SSS1) and its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions has been isolated and sequenced
2. __starch__, [Structure, organization, and chromosomal location of the gene encoding a form of rice soluble starch synthase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, organization, and chromosomal location of the gene encoding a form of rice soluble starch synthase%5BTitle%5D),  The exon/intron organization of the SSS1 gene was divergent from that of the rice Waxy gene coding for granule-bound starch synthase, thus suggesting that the SSS1 and granule-bound starch synthase genes have evolved from an ancestral gene in a different way or that the two genes are products of different ancestral genes that have converged during evolution
