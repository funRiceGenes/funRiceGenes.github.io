* **Key message**  
    + Collectively, our study establishes SHPR as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets OsSLK for degradation, and uncovers a protein ubiquitination pathway as a mechanism for modulating root meristem activity in rice
    + We show that SHPR interacts with Oryza sativa SEUSS-LIKE (OsSLK) in the nucleus and is required for OsSLK polyubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS)
