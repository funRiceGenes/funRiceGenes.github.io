* **Key message**  
    + The OsSec18 complex interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 to regulate vacuolar morphology in  rice endosperm cell
    + Overexpression of OsSec18 in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology of the protein bodies
    + The OsSec18 complex interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 to regulate vacuolar morphology in rice endosperm cell.
    + Further examination revealed that OsSec18 presented as a 290-kDa complex in rice endosperm cells
    + Moreover, Os60sP0 was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the OsSec18 complex contains another complex of P0(P1-P2)2 in rice endosperm cells
    + Our results revealed that the OsSec18 regulates vacuolar morphology in both yeast and rice endosperm cell and the OsSec18 interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 complex in rice endosperm cell
