* **Key message**  
    + By performing complementation assays with Atsfh1 mutants, we demonstrated that OsSNDP1 is involved in growth of root hairs
    + Cryo-scanning electron microscopy was utilized to further characterize the effect of the Ossndp1 mutation on root hair morphology
    + OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice
