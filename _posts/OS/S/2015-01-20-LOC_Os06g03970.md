* **Key message**  
    + OsSIK1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsSIK1 is expressed mainly in the stem and spikelet in rice
    + These results indicate that OsSIK1 plays important roles in salt and drought stress tolerance in rice, through the activation of the antioxidative system
    + We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice
    + The expression of OsSIK1 is mainly induced by salt, drought and H(2)O(2) treatments
    + Transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsSIK1 show higher tolerance to salt and drought stresses than control plants
    + Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants
    + OsERL is expressed in shoot apcies, internodes and anthers, and within the anther OsERL is expressed in sporophytic and tapetal cells
    + Results showed that mutations in OsERL led to striking defects in anther development
    + Cell biological analyses revealed that mutations in OsERL led to defected periclinal division in archesporial cells in anthers, suggesting a critical role of OsERL in rice anther development
    + The leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase OsERL plays a critical role in anther lobe formation in rice
