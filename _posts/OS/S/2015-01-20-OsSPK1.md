* **Key message**  
    + Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.
    + OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, Pit and Pia, against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo
    + Overall, we conclude that OsSPK1 is a direct and key signaling target of Pit-mediated immunity
    + OsSPK1 activates the small GTPase OsRac1, which in turn transduces the signal to the transcription factor RAC IMMUNITY1 (RAI1)
    + We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3
