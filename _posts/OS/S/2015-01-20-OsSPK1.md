* **Key message**  
    + Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.
    + OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, Pit and Pia, against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo
    + Overall, we conclude that OsSPK1 is a direct and key signaling target of Pit-mediated immunity
