* **Key message**  
    + In addition, overexpression of the OsSCE1 gene alters the biomass and grain yield parameters in transgenic rice plants
    + The rice SUMO conjugating enzymes OsSCE1 and OsSCE3 have opposing effects on drought stress.
    + Interestingly, OsSCE1 is distributed in specific parts of the nucleus and shows sumoylation activities in the absence of a SUMO ligase in E
