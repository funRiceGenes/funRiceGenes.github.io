* **Key message**  
    + Based on the analysis of DNA damage susceptibility and the effect on the expression of DNA repair-related genes using these mutants, we have demonstrated that OsSOG1 plays a more important role than OsSGL in controlling the DDR and DNA repair
    + In addition to OsSOG1 or OsSGL knockout mutants, OsSOG1 non-phosphorylatable mutants (OsSOG1-7A) were generated by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting (GT)
