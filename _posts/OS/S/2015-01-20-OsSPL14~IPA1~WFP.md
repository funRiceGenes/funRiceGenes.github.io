* **Key message**  
    + Two studies describe how regulatory variation at the rice gene OsSPL14 can lead to altered plant morphology and improve grain yield
    + We demonstrate that a point mutation in OsSPL14 perturbs OsmiR156-directed regulation of OsSPL14, generating an 'ideal' rice plant with a reduced tiller number, increased lodging resistance and enhanced grain yield
    + Moreover, our results demonstrated that IPA1 could directly bind to the promoter of rice teosinte branched1, a negative regulator of tiller bud outgrowth, to suppress rice tillering, and directly and positively regulate dense and erect panicle1, an important gene regulating panicle architecture, to influence plant height and panicle length
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a semidominant quantitative trait locus, IPA1 (Ideal Plant Architecture 1), which profoundly changes rice plant architecture and substantially enhances rice grain yield
    + We also demonstrate the feasibility of using the OsSLP14(WFP) allele to increase rice crop yield
    + Introduction of the high-yielding OsSPL14(WFP) allele into the standard rice variety Nipponbare resulted in increased rice production
    + Ideal plant architecture1 (IPA1) is critical in regulating rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture and substantially enhances grain yield
    + The elucidation of target genes of IPA1 genome-wide will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant architecture and to facilitating the breeding of elite varieties with ideal plant architecture
    + Higher expression of OsSPL14 in the reproductive stage promotes panicle branching and higher grain yield in rice
    + OsSPL14 promotes panicle branching and higher grain productivity in rice
    + OsSPL14 controls shoot branching in the vegetative stage and is affected by microRNA excision
    + Our study suggests that OsSPL14 may help improve rice grain yield by facilitating the breeding of new elite rice varieties
    + Here we show that the quantitative trait locus WFP (WEALTHY FARMER'S PANICLE) encodes OsSPL14 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14, also known as IPA1)
    + To elucidate its molecular basis, we first confirmed IPA1 as a functional transcription activator and then identified 1067 and 2185 genes associated with IPA1 binding sites in shoot apices and young panicles, respectively, through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays
    + Regulation of OsSPL14 by OsmiR156 defines ideal plant architecture in rice
    + Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes
    + Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice
    + The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P&lt;0
    + Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions.
    + IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.
    + These findings reveal that IPA1 is likely one of the long-speculated transcription factors that act with D53 to mediate the SL-regulated tiller development in rice
    + IPA1 returns to a nonphosphorylated state within 48 hours after infection, resuming support of the growth needed for high yield
    + Thus, IPA1 promotes both yield and disease resistance by sustaining a balance between growth and immunity
    + Phosphorylated IPA1 binds to the promoter of the pathogen defense gene WRKY45 and activates its expression, leading to enhanced disease resistance
    + Mechanistically, phosphorylation of IPA1 at amino acid Ser163 within its DNA binding domain occurs in response to infection by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and alters the DNA binding specificity of IPA1
    + Here we report that higher IPA1 levels enhance immunity
    + We discovered that gibberellin signalling might be partially responsible for the disease resistance and developmental defects in IPA1 overexpressors
    + We then generated transgenic rice plants expressing IPA1 with the pathogen-inducible promoter of OsHEN1; these plants had both enhanced disease resistance and enhanced yield-related traits
