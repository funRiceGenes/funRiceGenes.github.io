* **Key message**  
    + The ossro1c-1 mutant showed resistance not only to chloroplastic oxidative stress, but also to apoplastic oxidative stress
    + Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response
    + Interestingly, OsSRO1c-overexpressing rice showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress
    + OsSRO1c interacted with various stress-related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the OsSRO1c-interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance
    + The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST
    + The SNAC1-targeted gene OsSRO1c modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice
    + When compared with the well-characterized Arabidopsis SRO protein radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1), OsSRO1c has considerable variation in the protein sequence, and the two genes exhibit different expression profiles under abiotic stresses
    + However, the ossro1c-1 mutant and artificial microRNA-OsSRO1c transgenic rice were significantly impaired in cold tolerance
    + Expression analysis of rice SRO genes in response to various abiotic stresses showed that OsSRO1c, a rice SRO gene which functions downstream of the stress-responsive transcription factor SNAC1, is the major stress-responsive gene in the rice SRO family
    + Furthermore, ossro1c-1 and rcd1 showed different responses to multiple abiotic stresses
    + The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of OsSRO1c in mediating responses to multiple abiotic stresses
    + A special member of the rice SRO family, OsSRO1c, mediates responses to multiple abiotic stresses through interaction with various transcription factors
    + The loss-of-function mutant of OsSRO1c showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild-type plant, whereas OsSRO1c overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss
    + OsSRO1c was induced in guard cells by drought stress
    + By screening an Arabidopsis transcription factor library, 29 transcription factors interacted with OsSRO1c in yeast, but only two of these transcription factors were reported to interact with RCD1, which may partly explain the different responses of the two mutants under various stresses
