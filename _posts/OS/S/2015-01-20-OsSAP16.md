* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + There were no differences in stomatal development or morphology in either of these mutants, although overexpression of OsSAP16 reduced stomatal conductance
    + Overexpression of OsSAP16 Regulates Photosynthesis and the Expression of a Broad Range of Stress Response Genes in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Whole transcriptome analysis showed that overexpression of OsSAP16 led to global changes in gene expression consistent with the function of zinc-finger transcription factors
    + Loss of OsSAP16 function reduces germination while greater expression of OsSAP16 enhances germination at low temperature
