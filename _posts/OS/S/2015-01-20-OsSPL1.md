* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we performed functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa) S1P lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants and explored its possible involvement in abiotic stress response
    + Our results suggest that rice OsSPL1 plays an important role in abiotic stress responses
    + Overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased tolerance to salt and oxidative stress, when compared with the wild type
    + Furthermore, the expression levels of some selected stress-related genes in OsSPL1-overexpressing plants were reduced after application of salt or oxidative stress, indicating that the altered responsiveness of stress-related genes may be responsible for the reduced tolerance in OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants under salt and oxidative stress
    + Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance
    + Molecular characterization of rice sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene OsSPL1 and functional analysis of its role in disease resistance response.
    + Our results indicate that overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants attenuated disease resistance and facilitated programmed cell death
    + Expression of OsSPL1 was down-regulated in rice plants after treatments with salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, but was induced by infection with a virulent strain of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease
    + Transgenic tobacco lines with overexpression of OsSPL1 were generated and analyzed for the possible role of OsSPL1 in disease resistance response and PCD
    + Our results suggest that OsSPL1 has different functions in regulating disease resistance response and PCD in plants
