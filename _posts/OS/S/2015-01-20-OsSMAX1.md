* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsSMAX1 promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of OsSMAX1 suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of d14l and d3 but had little effect on their shoot branching phenotype
    + OsSMAX1 localizes in nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs), regulating downstream gene expression
