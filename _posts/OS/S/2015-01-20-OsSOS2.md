* **Key message**  
    + Unraveling the contribution of OsSOS2 in conferring salinity and drought tolerance in a high-yielding rice.
    + Using a combined approach based on physiological, biochemical, anatomical, microscopic, molecular, and agronomic assessment, the evidence presented in this study advocates the role of OsSOS2 in improving salinity and drought tolerance in rice
    + Keeping in mind the importance of developing crops pants with tolerance to multiple stresses, the present study established the potential of OsSOS2 for biotechnological applications to improve salinity and drought stress tolerance in diverse cultivars of rice

    + __OsbHLH96~OsbHLH044__, __OsSOS2__, [Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters
