* **Key message**  
    + Unraveling the contribution of OsSOS2 in conferring salinity and drought tolerance in a high-yielding rice.
    + Using a combined approach based on physiological, biochemical, anatomical, microscopic, molecular, and agronomic assessment, the evidence presented in this study advocates the role of OsSOS2 in improving salinity and drought tolerance in rice
    + Keeping in mind the importance of developing crops pants with tolerance to multiple stresses, the present study established the potential of OsSOS2 for biotechnological applications to improve salinity and drought stress tolerance in diverse cultivars of rice
