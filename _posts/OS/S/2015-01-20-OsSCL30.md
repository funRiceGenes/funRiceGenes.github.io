* **Key message**  
    + Under normal conditions, the expression of OsSCL30 was higher in leaves and leaf sheaths
    + OsSCL30 overexpression reduces the tolerance of rice seedlings to low temperature, drought and salt.
    + In root cells OsSCL30 was localized in the nuclei
    + The results of the rice seedling tolerance and recovery tests showed that overexpression of OsSCL30 diminished the resistance to low temperature, drought and salt stresses in transgenic rice and resulted in larger accumulation of reactive oxygen species
    + The results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of OsSCL30 decreased after low temperature, drought and salt treatment
    + In this study, by constructing overexpression vectors D-163 + 1300:OsSCL30 and D-163 + 1300-AcGFP:OsSCL30-GFP, the mechanism of action of OsSCL30 in various abiotic stresses was explored
    + Bioinformatics analysis showed that OsSCL30 was located on the chromosome 12 of rice Nipponbare, belonging to the plant-specific SCL subfamily of the SR protein family
