* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic expression of OsSEX4 complementary DNA complemented the leaf starch-excess phenotype of the Arabidopsis sex4-4 mutant
    + Genetic engineering of transitory starch accumulation by knockdown of OsSEX4 in rice plants for enhanced bioethanol production.
    + Starch accumulation was higher in OsSEX4-knockdown suspension-cultured cells, leaves, and rice straw compared with the wild type, suggesting that OsSEX4 plays an important role in degradation of transitory starch
