* **Key message**  
    + OsSPDS2 mRNA accumulated in roots during long term exposure to chilling temperature (12 degrees C)
    + Data suggested a distinct function of OsSPDS2 in chilling response in rice
    + ABA treatment up-regulated OsSPDS2, whereas salt stress did not change OsSPDS2 levels significantly
    + These data suggest that OsSPMS1 affects ethylene synthesis and may regulate seed germination and plant growth by affecting the ACC and ethylene pathways
    + The Spermine Synthase OsSPMS1 Regulates Seed Germination, Grain Size, and Yield.
    + Phenotypic analysis indicated that OsSPMS1 negatively regulates seed germination, grain size, and grain yield per plant
    + Most importantly, an OsSPMS1 knockout mutant showed an increase in grain yield per plant in a high-yield variety, Suken118, suggesting that OsSPMS1 is an important target for yield enhancement in rice
