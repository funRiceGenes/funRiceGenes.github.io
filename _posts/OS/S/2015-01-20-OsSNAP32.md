* **Key message**  
    + Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes
    + The expression of OsSNAP32 was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H2O2, PEG6000, and low temperature or after inoculation with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea strain Hoku 1)

* **Connection**  
    + __OsSEC3A__, __OsSNAP32__, [Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Disruption of OsSEC3A increases the content of salicylic acid and induces plant defense responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus
    + __OsSNAP32__, __OsSYP121__, [OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kDa) and OsVAMP714/724 (Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724)
    + __OsSNAP32__, __OsSYP121__, [OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSYP121 accumulates at fungi penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast.%5BTitle%5D),  The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast
