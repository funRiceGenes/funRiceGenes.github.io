* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsSPL9 enhances accumulation of Cu in rice grain and improves its digestibility and metabolism
    + Moreover, natural variation in the MIR528 promoter region caused differences in miR528 expression among rice varieties, potentially due to differences in the binding strength of the transcription factor OsSPL9
    + OsSPL9 was highly expressed in the early developing young panicles, consistent with its function of regulating panicle development
    + By combining expression analysis and dual-luciferase assays, we further confirmed that OsSPL9 directly activates the expression of RCN1 (rice TERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog) in the early developing young panicle to regulate the panicle branches and GNP
