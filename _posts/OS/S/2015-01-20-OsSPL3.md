* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning revealed that lcrn1 is caused by a mutation of a putative transcription factor coding gene OsSPL3 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE3)
    + Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of OsSPL3-binding sites and RNA-sequencing of differentially expressed transcripts in lcrn1 further identified potential direct targets of OsSPL3 in basal nodes, including a MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS50
