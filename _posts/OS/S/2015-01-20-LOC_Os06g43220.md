* **Key message**  
    + ossae1 knockout lines exhibited delayed seed germination, enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) during germination and in early seedling growth, and reduced seedling salt tolerance
    + OsSAE1 overexpression lines exhibited the converse phenotype, with increased seed germination and salt tolerance
    + In vivo and in vitro assays indicated that OsSAE1 binds directly to the promoter of OsABI5, a major downstream component of the ABA signaling pathway and acts as a major regulator of seed germination and stress response
    + This study provides important insights into OsSAE1 regulation of seed vigor and salt tolerance and facilitates the practical use of OsSAE1 in breeding salt-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding cultivation
    + Genetic analyses revealed that OsABI5-mediated ABA signaling functions downstream of OsSAE1
