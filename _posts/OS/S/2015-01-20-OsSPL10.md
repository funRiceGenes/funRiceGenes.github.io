* **Key message**  
    + We previously found a single-gene recessive mutant sst, which displayed increased salt tolerance and glabrous leaf and glume without trichomes, and identified an SBP-box gene OsSPL10 as the candidate of the SST gene
    + In addition, expression analysis indicated that OsSPL10 was preferentially expressed in young panicle and stem, and protein OsSPL10 was localized in nucleus
    + Taken together, OsSPL10 negatively controls salt tolerance  but positively controls trichome formation in rice
    + Disruption of OsSPL10 by genome editing decreased leaf trichome density and length in the NIL-HL6 background
    + HAIRY LEAF6 (HL6) encodes another transcription factor that regulates trichome initiation and elongation, and OsSPL10 directly binds to the HL6 promoter to regulate its expression
    + Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
    + Here, we report that OsSPL10 acts as a transcriptional regulator controlling trichome development
