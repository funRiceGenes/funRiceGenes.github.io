* **Key message**  
    + We previously found a single-gene recessive mutant sst, which displayed increased salt tolerance and glabrous leaf and glume without trichomes, and identified an SBP-box gene OsSPL10 as the candidate of the SST gene
    + In addition, expression analysis indicated that OsSPL10 was preferentially expressed in young panicle and stem, and protein OsSPL10 was localized in nucleus
    + Taken together, OsSPL10 negatively controls salt tolerance  but positively controls trichome formation in rice
    + Disruption of OsSPL10 by genome editing decreased leaf trichome density and length in the NIL-HL6 background
    + HAIRY LEAF6 (HL6) encodes another transcription factor that regulates trichome initiation and elongation, and OsSPL10 directly binds to the HL6 promoter to regulate its expression
    + Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
    + Here, we report that OsSPL10 acts as a transcriptional regulator controlling trichome development
    + Variations in OsSPL10 confer drought tolerance by directly regulating OsNAC2 expression and ROS production in rice.
    + OsSPL10 appears to play a vital role in drought tolerance by controlling ROS production and stomatal movements
    + Furthermore, knockdown or knockout of OsSPL10 induces fast stomatal closure and prevents water loss, thereby improving drought tolerance in rice
    + Based on these observations, we propose that OsSPL10 confers drought tolerance by regulating OsNAC2 expression and that OsSPL10 (Hap1) could be a valuable haplotype for genetic improvement of drought tolerance in rice
    + Importantly, we demonstrated that the varieties with the OsSPL10 (Hap1) allele show low expression levels of OsSPL10 and its downstream gene, OsNAC2, which decreases the expression of OsAP37 and increases the expression of OsCOX11, thus preventing ROS accumulation and PCD
