* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic lines with suppressed OsSYT-5 gene expression exhibited higher pollen viability and produced more grains compared to the wild type at both normal and drought stress conditions
    + Enhancement of drought tolerance in rice by silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene.
    + In the water deficit experiment, the transgenic lines with a silenced OsSYT-5 gene exhibited symptoms of drought stress seven days later than the wild type
    + Transgenic lines with suppressed expression of the OsSYT-5 gene exhibited an enhanced photosynthetic rate but reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration during water deficit stress
    + The silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene affected the expression of several genes associated with ABA-related stress signaling in the transgenic rice plants
