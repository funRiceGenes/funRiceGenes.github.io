* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The promoter of OsSULTR3;3 is highly active in the vascular bundles of leaves, stems and seeds, and its protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum
    + The findings reveal that OsSULTR3;3 plays an important role in grain metabolism, pointing to a new route to generate value-added grains in rice and other cereal crops
    + Map-based cloning and complementation identified the underlying lpa gene to be OsSULTR3;3
    + Disruption of OsSULTR3;3 reduces phytate and phosphorus concentrations and alters the metabolite profile in rice grains.
