* **Key message**  
    + Transcript analysis showed that OsSTLK was significantly induced in response to salt stress in rice shoot and root in a time and dosage-dependent fashion
    + Here, we identified a novel rice LRR-RLK member involved in salt tolerance and designated as OsSTLK (Oryza sativa L
    + Phenotypic observations indicated that OsSTLK overexpression exhibited reduced salt sensitivity, and improved salt stress tolerance
    + Further physiological analysis showed that OsSTLK overexpression remarkably reduced electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under salt stress conditions by up-regulating ROS-scavenging activities and modifying stomatal patterning
    + Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSTLK as an important positive regulator of salt stress tolerance perhaps through regulating ROS scavenging system, Na+/K+ ratio and MAPK signal pathway
