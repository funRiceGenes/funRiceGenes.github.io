* **Key message**  
    + OsSFR6 is an orthologue of AtSFR6, and thus a target for future manipulation to improve tolerance to osmotic and other abiotic stresses
    + Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice
    + We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
