* **Key message**  
    + OsSAC1 was found poorly and specifically expressed at the bottoms of young leaves and in the developing leaf sheathes
    + Whereas, lower sucrose and glucose concentrations were observed in the ossac1 young leaves and developing leaf sheathes than those of the WT
    + More rice plasmodesmata negative regulator OsGSD1 was detected in ossac1 young leaves and developing leaf sheathes than in those of the WT
    + These results suggest that ER targeted OsSAC1 may indirectly regulate sugar partitioning in carbon-demanding young leaves and developing leaf sheathes
    + I2/KI starch staining, ultrastructure observations, and starch content measurements indicated that more and larger starch granules accumulated in ossac1 source leaves than in wild-type (WT) source leaves
    + Extremely more OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1 (responsible for starch synthesis) expression and significantly less OscFBP1, OscFBP2, OsSPS1, and OsSPS11 (responsible for sucrose synthesis) and OsSWEET11, OsSWEET14, and OsSUT1 (responsible for sucrose loading) expression occurred in ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
    + Mutation of the OsSAC1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein with an unknown function, causes sugar accumulation in rice leaves.
    + OsSAC1 has been found to affect sugar partitioning in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Additionally, higher sucrose and glucose concentrations accumulated in the ossac1 source leaves than in WT source leaves
