## Key message
1. __ethylene__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsPIN3t led to improved drought tolerance, and GUS activity significantly increased when OsPIN3tpro::GUS plants were subjected to 20% polyethylene glycol stress
2. __seedling__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, knockdown of OsPIN3t caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that OsPIN3t is involved in the control of polar auxin transport
3. __auxin__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identify a putative auxin efflux carrier gene in rice, OsPIN3t, which acts in auxin polar transport but is also involved in the drought stress response in rice
4. __auxin__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, knockdown of OsPIN3t caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that OsPIN3t is involved in the control of polar auxin transport

6. __auxin__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance
