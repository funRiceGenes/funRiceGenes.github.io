* **Key message**  
    + A pollen-expressed gene from rice, OsPCBP, that was previously cloned and identified encodes a novel calmodulin-binding protein
    + Our experimental results provide convincing evidence that OsPCBP protein plays an important role during the late stage of pollen development
    + Cytological observations at different stages revealed that microspores from the OsPCBP double-stranded RNA interference plants developed normally until the binucleate stage, but about half were later aborted
    + Overexpression of OsPCBP in transgenic rice plants did not lead to phenotypic changes but did delay anther formation by about 1 week
