* **Key message**  
    + Functional analysis of OsPGIP1 in rice sheath blight resistance.
    + Furthermore, the levels of sheath blight resistance were in accordance with the expression levels of OsPGIP1 in the transgenic lines
    + Our results reveal the functions of OsPGIP1 and its resistance mechanism to rice sheath blight, which will facilitate rice breeding for sheath blight resistance
