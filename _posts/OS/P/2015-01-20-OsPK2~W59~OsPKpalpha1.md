* **Key message**  
    + OsPK2 encodes a plastidic pyruvate kinase involved in rice endosperm starch synthesis, compound granule formation and grain filling.
    + Altogether, these results denote new insights into the role of OsPK2 in plant seed development, especially in starch synthesis, compound granules formation and grain filling, which would be useful for genetic improvement of high yield and rice grain quality
    + The normal starch compound granules were drastically reduced and more single granules filled the endosperm cells of ospk2
    + Map-based cloning of OsPK2 indicated that it encodes a pyruvate kinase (PK, ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotranferase, EC 2
