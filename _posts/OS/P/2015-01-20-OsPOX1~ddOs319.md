* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, at the later vacuolated pollen stage, the GUS activity was highly induced by cold stress, suggesting that OsPOX1 is a flower-preferential cold-responsive gene in rice
    + A full-length cDNA corresponding to ddOs319, previously isolated as a cold-responsive gene in the flowers by mRNA differential display (Plant Cell Rep 26:1097-1110, 2007), was obtained from the cold-treated flowers by reverse transcription and nested PCR
    + Transgenic rice plants expressing P OsPOX1 -GUS showed minimal GUS activity in both shoots and roots at the vegetative stage
    + Cold-Responsive Regulation of a Flower-Preferential Class III Peroxidase Gene, OsPOX1, in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
