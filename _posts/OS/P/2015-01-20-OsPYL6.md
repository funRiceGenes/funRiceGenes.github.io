* **Key message**  
    + Both overexpression and RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 resulted in enhanced accumulation of ABA in seedlings under non-stress, at least, in part through upregulation of different NCED genes
    + Overexpression of OsPYL6 conferred ABA hypersensitivity during germination and promoted total root length
    + These results showed that OsPYL6 is a key regulator of plant development and drought tolerance, and fine-tuning of its expression is critical for improving yield and stress tolerance in rice
    + RNAi silencing of OsPYL6 also significantly reduced the grain yield under drought
    + ABA receptor OsPYL6 confers drought tolerance to indica rice through dehydration avoidance and tolerance mechanisms
    + Analysis of drought tolerance of OsPYL6 transgenics and WT plants showed that OsPYL6 overexpression enhanced the expression of stress responsive genes and dehydration tolerance
    + Here we report functional validation of ABA receptor OsPYL6 by constitutive and stress inducible overexpression, and RNAi silencing in an indica rice cv
