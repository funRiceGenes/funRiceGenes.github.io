## Expression information
__Expression__: Of simultaneous treatments with hormones and pathogenic bacteria, exogenously applying JA and ET significantly increased the expression level of OsPR1b genes in seedlings |  Compared with the control group that was inoculated with water, inoculation with a mixture of water and pathogenic bacteria hardly affected the expression level of OsPR1b gene, while cotreatment with SA and pathogenic bacteria slightly upregulated the expression level |  However, cotreatment with JA or ET and pathogenic bacteria managed to significantly upregulate the expression level of the OsPR1b gene by 4
