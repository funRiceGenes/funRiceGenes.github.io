* **Key message**  
    + OsPLS4 Is Involved in Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis and Affects Leaf Senescence in Rice.
    + A single nucleotide substitution in OsPLS4 reduced leaf cuticular wax, and the expression levels of most wax biosynthesis-associated genes were downregulated
    + Together, all the above results indicate that the OsPLS4 mutation affects cuticular wax biosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice, causing reduced cuticular wax and premature leaf senescence
    + Subcellular localization of OsPLS4 was observed in the chloroplast
