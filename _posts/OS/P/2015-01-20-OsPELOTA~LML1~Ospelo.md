* **Key message**  
    + A substitution mutation in OsPELOTA confers bacterial blight resistance by activating the salicylic acid pathway.
    + Here, we report the map-based cloning of the causal gene OsPELOTA (originally termed splHM47 )
    + LML1 is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    + LML1 can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the LML1 yeast ortholog mutant, dom34
    + Both lml1 and mutants of AtLML1 (the LML1 Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype as dom34
    + The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast
    + The Ospelo mutant showed defects in root system development and spotted leaves at early seedling stages
    + These results demonstrate that OsPelo positively regulates root development while its loss of function enhances pathogen resistance by pre-activation of defence responses in rice
    + Defence responses were induced in the Ospelo mutant, as shown by enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Detailed analysis showed that activation of a number of innate immunity-related genes might be responsible for the enhanced disease resistance in the Ospelo mutant
    + OsPelo was found to be expressed in various tissues throughout the plant, and the protein was located in mitochondria
    + In addition, whole-genome transcriptome analysis showed that OsPelo was significantly associated with a number of biological processes, including translation, metabolism and biotic stress response
