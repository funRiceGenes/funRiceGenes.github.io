    + A 22-bp deletion in OsPLS3 gene encoding a DUF266-containing protein is implicated in rice leaf senescence.
    + OsPLS3 regulates the onset of leaf senescence in rice
    + Through map-based cloning strategy, we determined that 22-bp deletion in the OsPLS3 gene encoding a domain of unknown function 266 (DUF266)-containing protein, a member of GT14-like, underlies the premature leaf senescence phenotype in the ospls3 mutant
    + The OsPLS3 mRNA levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in wild-type rice, implying a negative role of OsPLS3 in regulating leaf senescence
    + Our results indicated that the DUF266-containing gene OsPLS3 plays an important role in the onset of leaf senescence, in part through cytokinin and ethylene signaling in rice
    + Key message The OsPLS3 locus was isolated by map-based cloning that encodes a DUF266-containing protein
    + Physiological analysis, and histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy assays indicated that the ospls3 mutant accumulated higher levels of ethylene and reactive oxygen species than its wild type
    + Compared to the wild type IR64, the spotted-leaf mutant spl21 exhibited loss of chlorophyll, breakdown of chloroplasts, down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes, and up-regulation  of senescence associated genes, which indicated that OsGCNT regulates premature leaf senescence
    + High throughput RNA sequencing analysis provided further evidence for the biological effects of loss of OsGCNT function on cell death, premature leaf senescence and enhanced disease resistance in rice
    + Thus, we demonstrated that the novel OsGCNT regulated rice innate immunity and immunity-associated leaf senescence probably by changing the jasmonate metabolic  pathway
    + Functional inactivation of OsGCNT induces enhanced disease resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice
    + oryzae, up-regulation of pathogenesis-related genes and increased level of jasmonate which suggested that OsGCNT is a negative  regulator of defense response in rice
