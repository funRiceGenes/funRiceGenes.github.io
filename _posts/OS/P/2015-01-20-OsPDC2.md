    + __OsPDC1__, __OsPDC2__, [Production and phenotypic analysis of rice transgenics with altered levels of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Production and phenotypic analysis of rice transgenics with altered levels of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase proteins%5BTitle%5D),  Correlations noted in this study between the pattern of expression of the Pdc alpha-subunit and Ospdc2 transcript as well as between the Pdc beta-subunit and Ospdc1 transcript suggest the possibility that alpha-subunit is encoded by Ospdc2 and that beta-subunit is encoded by Ospdc1
    + __OsPDC1__, __OsPDC2__, [Characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase genes from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase genes from rice%5BTitle%5D),  Rice pdc2 is also inducible by anoxia but to a much lesser extent than pdc1
