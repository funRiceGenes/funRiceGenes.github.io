* **Key message**  
    + RNA interference knockdown of OsPAO led to pheophorbide a accumulation in leaves (especially dark-induced senescent leaves) and leaf death from regeneration stage onwards, even transgenic plants inviability after transplantation
    + These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses

    + __OsPAO__, __SGR~OsSGR__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D), SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves
    + __OsPAO__, __SGR~OsSGR__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D), Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
