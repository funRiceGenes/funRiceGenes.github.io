* **Key message**  
    + OsPHL3 contains a MYB-CC domain, and was localized in the nucleus with transcriptional activation potential
    + Rice lines overexpressing OsPHL3 showed a delayed flowering time in the genetic background of TP309 under both long-day (Beijing) and short-day (Hainan) conditions
    + By contrast, the knockout rice lines of OsPHL3 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology promoted flowering time regardless of genetic backgrounds (i
    + Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs)
