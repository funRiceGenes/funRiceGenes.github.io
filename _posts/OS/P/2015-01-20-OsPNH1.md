## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Around the SAM, OsPNH1 was strongly expressed in developing leaf primordia, specifically in the presumptive vascular domains, developing vascular tissues, a few cell-layers of the adaxial region, and future bundle sheath extension cells
2. __leaf__, [OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice%5BTitle%5D),  On the basis of these observations, we propose that OsPNH1 functions not only in SAM maintenance as previously thought, but also in leaf formation through vascular development

## Connection
1. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __OsPNH1__, [Overexpression analysis suggests that FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 is involved in rice leaf development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression analysis suggests that FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 is involved in rice leaf development.%5BTitle%5D),  By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression
