    + __OsHRZ1__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we reveal that OsPRI1 interacts with OsHRZ1
    + __OsHRZ1__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1
    + __OsHRZ1__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild type roots, but increased in the hrz1-2 mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1
    + __OsHRZ1__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
    + __OsIRO2__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
    + __OsIRO2__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
