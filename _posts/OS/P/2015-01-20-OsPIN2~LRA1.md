* **Key message**  
    + The data suggest that OsPIN2 has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture
    + The expression patterns of the auxin reporter DR5::GUS and quantification of auxin distribution showed that OsPIN2 over-expression increased auxin transport from the shoot to the root-shoot junction, resulting in a non-tissue-specific accumulation of more free auxin at the root-shoot junction relative to WT
    + Over-expression of OsPIN2 enhanced auxin transport from shoots to roots, but did not alter the polar auxin pattern in the roots
    + OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice
    + Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1
    + Altering OsPIN2 expression by genetic transformation can be directly used for modifying rice architecture
    + Overexpressing OsPIN2 enhances aluminium internalization by elevating vesicular trafficking in rice root apex.
    + In this study, it was found that the rice OsPIN2 overexpression line (OX1) had significantly reduced Al content in its cell wall and increased Al concentration in cell sap only in rice root tips relative to the wild-type (WT)
    + Taken together, the data indicate that endocytic vesicular trafficking might contribute to Al internalization, and that overexpressing OsPIN2 enhances rice Al tolerance via elevated endocytic vesicular trafficking and Al internalization
    + Overexpressing OsPIN2 enhances aluminium internalization by elevating vesicular trafficking in rice root apex
    + OsPIN2 was shown to play an important role in mediating root gravitropic responses in rice and was essential for plants to produce normal RGAs
    + Taken together, our findings suggest that OsPIN2 plays an important role in root gravitropic responses and determining the root system architecture in rice by affecting polar auxin transport in the root tip
    + OsPIN2 was mainly expressed in roots and the base of shoots, and showed polar localization in the plasma membrane of root epidermal and cortex cells
    + The OsPIN2 gene encodes a member of the auxin-efflux carrier proteins that possibly regulates the basipetal auxin flow from the root tip towards the root-elongation zone
    + Overexpression of OsPIN2 Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice.
    + However, overexpression of OsPIN2 caused a loss of sensitivity in the root response to P deficiency
    + Compared to WT plants, overexpression of OsPIN2 had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP
    + These results suggest that higher OsPIN2 expression regulates rice root growth and development maybe by changing auxin distribution in roots under LP condition
    + Surprisingly, overexpression of OsPIN2 might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP
