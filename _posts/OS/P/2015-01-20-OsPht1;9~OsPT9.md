* **Key message**  
    + Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in OsPT9 or OsPT10 knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions
    + OsPT9 and OsPT10 were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation
    + High-affinity Km values for Pi transport of OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by yeast experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of anion transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing OsPT9 and OsPT10
    + Pi uptake and Pi concentrations in transgenic plants harbouring overexpressed OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by Pi concentration analysis and (33) P-labelled Pi uptake rate analysis
    + Taken together, our results suggest that OsPT9 and OsPT10 redundantly function in Pi uptake
    + We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: OsPHT1;9 (OsPT9) and OsPHT1;10 (OsPT10)
    + Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice
