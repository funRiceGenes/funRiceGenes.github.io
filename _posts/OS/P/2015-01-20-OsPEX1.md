* **Key message**  
    + Rice leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein OsPEX1 mediates the intersection of lignin deposition and plant growth
    + When OsPEX1 was ectopically expressed in rice cultivars with tall stature that lacks the allele of semi-dwarf 1, well-known green revolution gene, the resulting transgenic plants displayed reduced height and enhanced lodging resistance
    + Lastly, we demonstrated that modulating OsPEX1 expression could provide a tool for improving rice lodging resistance
    + Conversely, OsPEX1-suppresssed transgenics displayed low lignin content and reduced transcriptional abundance of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis, indicating that the OsPEX1 mediates lignin biosynthesis and/or deposition in rice
    + Our study uncovers a causative effect between the expression of OsPEX1 and lignin deposition
