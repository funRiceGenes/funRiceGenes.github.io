* **Key message**  
    + OsPHS1 is required for both male and female gamete development in rice.
    + Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that the OsPHS1 protein is situated in the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsPHS1 expression levels were mainly expressed in panicles at the beginning of meiosis
    + Taken together, our results suggest an important role for OsPHS1 in homologous chromosome pairing in both male and female gametogenesis in rice
