* **Key message**  
    + Expression of YY2 mRNA was confined to the tapetal cells
    + Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
    + We identified a rice mutant oslap6 with complete male sterile phenotype caused by defects in pollen exine formation
    + Cytological observations revealed that abnormal bacula deposition and ubisch body structures for sexine formation led to pollen rupture in ospks1
    + The expression analysis showed that the OsPKS1 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and anther locules from stage 9 to stage 11 during anther development in rice
    + The OsPKS1 knockout mutants obtained by Crispr-Cas9-mediated editing exhibited a complete male sterile phenotype
