* **Key message**  
    + The OsPS1-F gene regulates growth and development in rice by modulating photosynthetic electron transport rate.
    + Our results illustrate that OsPS1-F plays an important role in regulating proper growth and development of rice plants
    + Ds insertion in rice OsPS1-F gene results in semi-dwarf plants with reduced tiller number and grain yield, while genetic complementation with OsPS1-F rescued the mutant phenotype
    + Here, we report the characterization of OsPS1-F (encoding Oryza sativa PHOTOSYSTEM 1-F subunit) using a single copy Ds insertion rice mutant line
