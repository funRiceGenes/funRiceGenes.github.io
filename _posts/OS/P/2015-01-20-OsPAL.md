* **Connection**  
    + __OsPAL__, __PAL~OsPAL4__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D), OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
    + __JIOsPR10~OsPR10__, __OsPAL__, [Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 induces rice resistance to RSRD caused by Fusarium proliferatum and promotes plant growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 induces rice resistance to RSRD caused by Fusarium proliferatum and promotes plant growth%5BTitle%5D),  This was related to enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and to significantly upregulated expression levels of OsAOX, OsLOX, OsPAL, and OsPR10 in rice
    + __OsCASP1__, __OsPAL__, [Radial transport difference mediated by root endodermal barriers contributes to differential cadmium accumulation between japonica and indica subspecies of rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Radial transport difference mediated by root endodermal barriers contributes to differential cadmium accumulation between japonica and indica subspecies of rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  The lignin/suberin content in japonica subspecies was 47%/42% greater than that in indica subspecies because of the higher expression of lignin/suberin biosynthesis-related genes (OsCASP1, OsPAL, OsCYP86A1 and OsKCS20)
