* **Key message**  
    + gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack
    + These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus
    + When transgenic plants were inoculated with virulent blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), they developed many resistant-type lesions on the inoculated leaf accompanying earlier activation of defense-related genes PR-1 and PBZ1 than in control plants
    + Both mRNA and protein analysis showed that PBZ1 was not induced by salicylic acid or an active metabolite, 1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide
    + However, upon chitin treatment, the expression of defense-related genes PAL1 and PBZ1 in the cell culture was greater in the mutants compared with wild-type plants
    + Orysa sativa pathogenesis-related protein 10a (OsPR10a) was induced by pathogens, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethephon, abscisic acid (ABA), and NaCl
    + Probenazole (PBZ) induces non-race specific resistance in rice plants against rice blast fungus and PBZ1 was identified as a PBZ-inducible gene from rice
    + The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes
    + Expression of defense genes PAL1 and PBZ1 as well as OsRap2
    + Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1)
    + Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type
    + Identification of an OsPR10a promoter region responsive to salicylic acid
    + We demonstrated the inducibility of OsPR10a promoter by SA using transgenic Arabidopsis carrying OsPR10a:GFP as well as by transient expression assays in rice
    + Transgenic rice and Arabidopsis overexpressing OsPR10a significantly increased the length of primary root under phosphate deficiency (-Pi) condition
    + These results showed that OsPR10a might play multiple roles in phosphate recycling in phosphate-starved cells and senescing leaves, and could improve resistance to pathogen infection and/or against chewing insect pests
    + Our findings suggest that gene regulation of OsPR10a could act as a good model system to unravel the mechanisms behind the correlation between Pi starvation and plant-pathogen interactions, and also provides a potential application in crops disease resistance
    + Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of OsCDPK1 confers disease resistance by affecting OsPR10a expression in rice.
    + OsPR10a and OsCDPK1 showed corresponding expression patterns and were up-regulated in response to the jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and Xoo treatments, and OsPR1 and OsPR4 were significantly up-regulated in OEtr-1
    + The rice pathogenesis-related protein OsPR10a was scarcely expressed in OsCDPK1-silenced (Ri-1) rice, which was highly sensitive to pathogen infection
