* **Key message**  
    + DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.
    + Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localized OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, which provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signaling pathway
    + Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance
