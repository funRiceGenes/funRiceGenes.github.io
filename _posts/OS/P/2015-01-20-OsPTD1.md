* **Key message**  
    + Our results suggest that OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for rice fertilization and CO formation, possibly by stabilizing the recombinant intermediates during meiosis
    + Further investigations showed that OsSHOC1 physically interacted with OsPTD1 and that the latter was also required for normal CO formation and plant fertility
    + In this study, we report the isolation of a meiotic gene, OsSHOC1, and the identification of its partner, OsPTD1
    + OsSHOC1 and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.
