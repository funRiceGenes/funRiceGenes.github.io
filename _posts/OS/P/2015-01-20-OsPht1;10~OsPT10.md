1. __transporter__, [Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: OsPHT1;9 (OsPT9) and OsPHT1;10 (OsPT10)
