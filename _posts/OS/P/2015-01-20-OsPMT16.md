* **Key message**  
    + These results indicate that OsPMT16 contributes significantly to pistil development during reproductive growth
    + Rice Putative Methyltransferase Gene OsPMT16 Is Required for Pistil Development Involving Pectin Modification
    + OsPMT16 expression was confirmed in the pistil, and effects of pectin methylesterification regulation on the reproductive stage were investigated by studying the phenotype of the T-DNA insertion mutant
    + The ospmt16 mutant showed significantly reduced fertility
    + Herein, we report the functional characterization of the OsPMT16 gene, which encodes a putative pectin methyltransferase (PMT) in rice
