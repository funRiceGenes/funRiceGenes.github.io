* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The fact that levels of Pdc beta-subunit were particularly high in pUH-sPdc1 (plasmid construct designed for over-expression of Ospdc1) seedlings while levels of beta-subunit levels were negligible or lower in pUH-asPdc1 (plasmid construct designed for under-expression of Ospdc1) seedlings also support these observations

* **Connection**  
    + __OsPDC1__, __OsPDC2__, [Production and phenotypic analysis of rice transgenics with altered levels of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Production and phenotypic analysis of rice transgenics with altered levels of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase proteins%5BTitle%5D), Correlations noted in this study between the pattern of expression of the Pdc alpha-subunit and Ospdc2 transcript as well as between the Pdc beta-subunit and Ospdc1 transcript suggest the possibility that alpha-subunit is encoded by Ospdc2 and that beta-subunit is encoded by Ospdc1
    + __OsPDC1__, __OsPDC2__, [Characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase genes from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase genes from rice%5BTitle%5D), Rice pdc2 is also inducible by anoxia but to a much lesser extent than pdc1
