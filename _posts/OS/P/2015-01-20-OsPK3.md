* **Key message**  
    + OsPK3 was constitutively expressed  but had relatively higher expression levels in leaf and developing caryopsis and  specific expression signals in tissues involved in sucrose transport and unloading, supporting its biological function in regulation of grain filling by affecting sucrose translocation
    + The loss of function of OsPK3 caused reduced PK activity and sucrose translocation defects from source to sink in rice, which led to compromised grain filling
    + Both OsPK1 and OsPK4 localized to the mitochondria and cytosol and were recruited to the mitochondria by OsPK3
