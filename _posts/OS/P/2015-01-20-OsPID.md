## Key message
1. __adventitious root__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism
2. __meristem__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of OsPID mRNA distribution showed a complex pattern in shoot meristems, indicating that it probably plays a role in the pattern formation and organogenesis in the rice shoot
3. __auxin__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Abnormalities observed in the plants that overexpress OsPID could be phenocopied by treatment with an inhibitor of active polar transport of auxin, indicating that OsPID could be involved in the control of polar auxin transport in rice
4. __auxin__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)), Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport
5. __shoot__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism
6. __shoot__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of OsPID mRNA distribution showed a complex pattern in shoot meristems, indicating that it probably plays a role in the pattern formation and organogenesis in the rice shoot
7. __root__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism
8. __root development__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism
9. __growth__, [Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism
