* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The expression of OsPIL11 was organ-specific and was regulated by leaf development, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA)
    + When grown under continuous red light, OsPIL11-overexpressed transgenic tobacco exhibited shorter hypocotyls and larger cotyledons and leaves compared to wild-type seedlings
    + In rice, overexpression and loss-of-function mutations of OsPIL11 reduce or increase tiller number by regulating the expression of OsTB1
