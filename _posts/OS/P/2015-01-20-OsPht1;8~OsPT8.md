11. __OsPht1;8~OsPT8__, __OsSPX1__, [Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsPT2 phosphate transporter 2 and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi OsSPX1-Ri plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport
12. __OsPht1;8~OsPT8__, __OsSPX1__, [Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8

15. __OsPHR2__, __OsPht1;8~OsPT8__, [Investigating the contribution of the phosphate transport pathway to arsenic accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Investigating the contribution of the phosphate transport pathway to arsenic accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In hydroponic experiments, a rice mutant defective in OsPHF1 for phosphate transporter traffic facilitator1 lost much of the ability to take up Pi and arsenate and to transport them from roots to shoots, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing either the Pi transporter OsPht1;8 OsPT8 or the transcription factor OsPHR2 for phosphate starvation response2 had enhanced abilities of Pi and arsenate uptake and translocation
