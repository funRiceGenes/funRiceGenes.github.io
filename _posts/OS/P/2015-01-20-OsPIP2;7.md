* **Key message**  
    + qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment
    + Overexpression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Arabidopsis yielded enhanced arsenite tolerance and higher biomass accumulation
    + Transcript analysis demonstrated that the expression of OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 were downregulated in shoots and strongly upregulated in rice roots by high B treatment
    + Arabidopsis lines overexpressing OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 showed significantly higher biomass production and greater root length, however there was no difference in B accumulation in long term uptake assay
    + Short-term uptake assay using tracer B ((1)(0)B) in shoots and roots demonstrated increased (1)(0)B accumulation in Arabidopsis lines expressing OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7, compare to wild type control plants
    + Efflux assay of B in the roots showed that (1)(0)B was effluxed from the Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsPIP2;4 or OsPIP2;7 during the initial 1-h of assay
    + These data indicate that OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 are involved in mediating B transport in rice and provide tolerance via efflux of excess B from roots and shoot tissues
    + Two rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7, are involved in transport and providing tolerance to boron toxicity
    + We have previously shown that a rice gene, OsPIP2;7, was generally up-regulated in roots but down-regulated in shoots at the early stage of chilling stress
    + Heterologous expression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of arsenite
    + Furthermore, OsPIP2;7 enhanced the transpiration rate and tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice
    + These results indicated that OsPIP2;7 was involved in rapid water transport and maintenance of the water balance in cells, and ultimately improves the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress
