* **Key message**  
    + The osppr11 mutants had yellowing leaves and a lethal phenotype that inhibited chloroplast development and photosynthesis-related gene expressionÂ and reduced photosynthesis-related protein accumulation in seedlings
    + OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.
    + OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice
    + These results indicate that OsPPR11 is essential for chloroplast development and function by affecting group II intron splicing in rice
    + In this study, we identified a nuclear gene encoding the P-type PPR protein OsPPR11 in chloroplasts

    + __OsCAF2__, __OsPPR11__, [OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D), OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsPPR11__, [OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPPR11 is required for ndhA, and ycf3-1 introns splicing and interact with CRM family protein OsCAF2, suggesting that these two proteins may form splicing complexes to regulate group II introns splicing
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsPPR11__, [OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D),  Further analysis revealed that OsCAF2 interacts with OsPPR11 through the N-terminus
