* **Key message**  
    + OsPUB15, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions to reduce cellular oxidative stress during seedling establishment
    + OsPUB15 transcript levels were increased upon H2O2, salt and drought stresses; plants overexpressing the gene grew better than the wild type under high salinity
    + A T-DNA insertional mutation in OsPUB15 caused severe growth retardation and a seedling-lethal phenotype
    + Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsPUB15 at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains
    + These results reveal that the E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance
    + The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.
    + We found that OsPUB15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of PID2 (PID2K) in vitro and in vivo and the ARM repeat domain of OsPUB15 was essential for the interaction
    + In vitro biochemical assays indicated that PID2K possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate OsPUB15
