    + __OsHRZ1__, __OsPRI1~OsbHLH115__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
    + __OsIRO2~OsbHLH056__, __OsPRI1~OsbHLH115__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
