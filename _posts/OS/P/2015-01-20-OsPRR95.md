* **Key message**  
    + Two central circadian oscillators OsPRR59 and OsPRR95 modulate magnesium homeostasis and carbon fixation in rice.
    + Here, we report two central oscillator genes of circadian clock, OsPRR95 and OsPRR59 in rice, which function as transcriptional repressors to negatively regulate the rhythmic expression of OsMGT3 encoding a chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter
    + Furthermore, sugar triggers the increase of superoxide, which may act as a feedback signal to positively regulate the expression of OsPRR95 and OsPRR59
    + We also found that OsPRR95 binds to the ABA receptor gene REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS10 (OsRCAR10) DNA and inhibits its expression
    + Genetic analysis showed OsRCAR10 acts downstream of OsPRR95 in mediating ABA responses
    + In addition, the induction of OsPRR95 by ABA partly required a functional OsRCAR10, and the ABA responsive element (ABRE)-binding factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) bound directly to the promoter of OsPRR95 and activated its expression, thus establishing a regulatory feedback loop between OsPRR95, OsRCAR10 and OsABI5
