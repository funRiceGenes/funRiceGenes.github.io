* **Key message**  
    + The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress
    + We previously identified a salt and drought stress-responsive TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP252 from rice
    + Overexpression of a TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP252 enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Through microarray analysis, a salt-responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings
    + Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice
