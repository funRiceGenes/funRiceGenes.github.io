* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report the influence of altered OsPTR9 expression on nitrogen utilization efficiency, growth, and grain yield
    + Altered expression of the PTR/NRT1 homologue OsPTR9 affects nitrogen utilization efficiency, growth and grain yield in rice
    + These results suggest that OsPTR9 might hold potential for improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and grain yield in rice breeding
    + Elevated expression of OsPTR9 in transgenic rice plants resulted in enhanced ammonium uptake, promotion of lateral root formation and increased grain yield
    + OsPTR9 expression is regulated by exogenous nitrogen and by the day-night cycle
