* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AK068055](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK068055)

* **Key message**  
    + Tissue-specific expression of OsPUT1 by semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the gene was expressed in all tissues except seeds and roots
    + Based on those observations, this rice gene was named polyamine uptake transporter 1 (OsPUT1)
