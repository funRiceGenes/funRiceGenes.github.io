* **Key message**  
    + A novel gene was isolated by cDNA microarray analysis and designated as OsPI1 (Oryza sativaPhosphate-limitation Inducible Gene 1)
    + The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots
    + When phosphate was supplied to phosphate-deficient plants, the OsPI1 transcripts rapidly disappeared
    + The OsPI1 gene shows the same characteristics as the TPSI1/Mt4 family (the phosphate starvation inducible novel gene family)
    + It is suggested that OsPI1 acts as riboregulator, that is, it binds with other molecules under phosphate starvation and regulates their function
    + Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status
