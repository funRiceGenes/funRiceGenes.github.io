* **Key message**  
    + Characterization of Ospho1;1 and Ospho1;2 insertion mutants revealed that only Ospho1;2 mutants had defects in Pi homeostasis, namely strong reduction in Pi transfer from root to shoot, which was accompanied by low-shoot and high-root Pi
    + Our data identify OsPHO1;2 as playing a key role in the transfer of Pi from roots to shoots in rice, and indicate that this gene could be regulated by its cis-natural antisense transcripts
    + Characterization of the rice PHO1 gene family reveals a key role for OsPHO1;2 in phosphate homeostasis and the evolution of a distinct clade in dicotyledons
    + However, while the OsPHO1;2 sense transcript was relatively stable under various nutrient deficiencies, the antisense transcript was highly induced by inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency
    + The most abundantly expressed gene was OsPHO1;2 in the roots, for both sense and antisense transcripts
    + OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles
    + Taken together, OsPHO1;2 expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds
    + At the reproductive stage, both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 showed higher expression in the node I, the uppermost node connecting to panicle
    + Furthermore, OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 expressed in the caryopsis are important for delivering of P from the maternal tissues to the filial tissues for seed development
    + Knockout of OsPHO1;2 as well as OsPHO1;1 with less extent decreased the distribution of P to the seed, resulting in decreased seed size and delayed germination
    + Both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 were localized to the plasma membrane and showed influx transport activities for inorganic phosphate
