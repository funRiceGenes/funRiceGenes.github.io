## Key message
1. __flower__, [An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15%5BTitle%5D),  Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant
2. __flower__, [An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function
3. __flower__, [An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
