* **Key message**  
    + Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant
    + In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function
    + Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
