* **Key message**  
    + Accumulation of the RNA polymerase subunit RpoB depends on RNA editing by OsPPR16 and affects chloroplast development during early leaf development in rice.
    + We found that OsPPR16 is responsible for a single editing event at position 545 in the chloroplast rpoB mRNA, resulting in an amino acid change from serine to leucine in the ¦Â-subunit of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase
    + Thus, by editing the rpoB mRNA, OsPPR16 is required for faithful plastid transcription, which in turn is required for chlorophyll synthesis and efficient chloroplast development
    + In striking contrast to loss-of-function mutations of the putative orthologue in Arabidopsis, which were  reported to have no visible phenotype, knock-out of OsPPR16 leads to impaired accumulation of RpoB, reduced expression of PEP-dependent genes and a pale phenotype during early plant development
