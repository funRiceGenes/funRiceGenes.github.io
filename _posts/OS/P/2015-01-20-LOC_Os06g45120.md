    + A single cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A1 leads to premature leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.
    + The OsPSL1/VHA-A1 transcript levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in both the ospls1 mutant and its wild type
    + The significant decrease in both OsPSL1/VHA-A1 gene expression and VHA enzyme activity in the ospls1 mutant strongly suggests a negative regulatory role for the normal OsPLS1/VHA-A1 gene in the onset of rice leaf senescence
    + To conclude, OsPLS1 is implicated in leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice
    + Despite normal development in early seedlings, the ospls1 mutant leaves displayed lesion-mimics and early senescence, and a high transpiration rate after tillering
    + Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that a cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A1 (VHA-A1) underlies the phenotypic abnormalities in the ospls1 mutant
    + The ospls1 mutant featured higher salicylic acid (SA) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and activation of signal transduction by up-regulation of WRKY genes in leaves
    + Consistent with this, the ospls1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous SA and/or H2O2
    + Physiological and Transcriptome Analyses of Early Leaf Senescence for ospls1 Mutant Rice (Oryza sativa L.) during the Grain-Filling Stage.
    + Some antioxidative and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were detected to be differentially expressed in the senescing leaves of ospls1 mutant, suggesting that these genes probably play response and regulatory roles in leaf senescence
    + Results showed that the ospls1 mutant underwent significant decreases in the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm), net photosynthesis rate (Pn), and soluble sugar and protein, followed by the decreases in OsVHA-A transcript and vacuolar H<U+207A>-ATPase activity
    + RNA-seq results showed that 4827 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in ospls1 mutant between 0 day and 14 days, and the pathways of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and photosynthesis were downregulated in the senescing leaves of ospls1 mutant during the grain-filling stage
    + Finally, yield traits were severely suppressed in the ospls1 mutant
