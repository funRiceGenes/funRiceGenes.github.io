* **Key message**  
    + The OsPQT3 knockout mutants (ospqt3) display enhanced resistance to oxidative and salt stress with elevated expression of OsGPX1, OsAPX1, and OsSOD1
    + More importantly, the ospqt3 mutants show significantly enhanced agronomic performance with higher yield compared with the wild type under salt stress in greenhouse as well as in field conditions
    + We further showed that OsPQT3 expression rapidly decreased in response to oxidative and other abiotic stresses as AtPQT3 does
    + Taken together, these results show that OsPQT3 is functionally well conserved in rice as an off-switch in stress response as AtPQT3 in Arabidopsis
