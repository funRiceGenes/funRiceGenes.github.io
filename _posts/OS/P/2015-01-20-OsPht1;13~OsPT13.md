## Connection
1. __OsPht1;11~OsPT11__, __OsPht1;13~OsPT13__, [Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family%5BTitle%5D)),  To better understand this pathway, we combined genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to determine the specific functions of two symbiosis-specific members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) gene family from rice, ORYsa;PHT1;11 (PT11) and ORYsa;PHT1;13 (PT13)
2. __OsPht1;11~OsPT11__, __OsPht1;13~OsPT13__, [Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family%5BTitle%5D)),  Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis
