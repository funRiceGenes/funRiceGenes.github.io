## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPPR1 gene was found to contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide in the N-terminal region, suggesting that the gene product targets to the chloroplast
2. __chloroplast__, [OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, the results suggest that the OsPPR1 is a nuclear gene of rice, encoding the PPR protein that might play a role in the chloroplast biogenesis
3. __chloroplast__, [OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis%5BTitle%5D), OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis
4. __leaf__, [OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  Expression analysis and immunoblot analysis suggested that the OsPPR1 was accumulated mainly in rice leaf
