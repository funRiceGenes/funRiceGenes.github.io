* **Key message**  
    + In this study, to investigate the function of OsPUB7 (Plant U-box gene in Oryza sativa), we constructed a CRISPR/Cas9 vector, generated OsPUB7 gene-edited individuals, and evaluated resistance to abiotic stress using gene-edited lines
    + This result provides evidence that OsPUB7 will be a useful target for both breeding and future research on drought tolerance/abiotic stress in rice
