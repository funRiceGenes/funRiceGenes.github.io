* **Key message**  
    + A single cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A1 leads to premature leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.
    + The OsPSL1/VHA-A1 transcript levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in both the ospls1 mutant and its wild type
    + The significant decrease in both OsPSL1/VHA-A1 gene expression and VHA enzyme activity in the ospls1 mutant strongly suggests a negative regulatory role for the normal OsPLS1/VHA-A1 gene in the onset of rice leaf senescence
    + To conclude, OsPLS1 is implicated in leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice
    + Despite normal development in early seedlings, the ospls1 mutant leaves displayed lesion-mimics and early senescence, and a high transpiration rate after tillering
    + Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that a cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A1 (VHA-A1) underlies the phenotypic abnormalities in the ospls1 mutant
    + The ospls1 mutant featured higher salicylic acid (SA) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and activation of signal transduction by up-regulation of WRKY genes in leaves
    + Consistent with this, the ospls1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous SA and/or H2O2
