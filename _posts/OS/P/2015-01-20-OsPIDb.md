    + __OsPID__, __OsPIDb__, [PINOID is required for formation of the stigma and style in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PINOID is required for formation of the stigma and style in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We constructed double mutants of OsPID and its closest homolog, OsPIDb, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either ospid is compensated by additional homologous genes or OsPID has different functions in rice compared to PID in other organisms
