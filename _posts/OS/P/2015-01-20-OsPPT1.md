* **Key message**  
    + A yeast complementation study revealed that OsPPT1a expression successfully recovered the growth defect of the coq2 mutant
    + The deduced amino acid sequence of OsPPT1a contained a putative mitochondrial sorting signal at the N-terminus and conserved domains for putative substrate-binding sites typical of PPT protein family members
    + The subcellular localization of OsPPT1a protein was shown to be mainly in mitochondria based on studies using a green fluorescent protein-PPT fusion
