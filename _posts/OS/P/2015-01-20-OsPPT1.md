## Key message
1. __growth__, [Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  A yeast complementation study revealed that OsPPT1a expression successfully recovered the growth defect of the coq2 mutant
2. __mitochondria__, [Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The deduced amino acid sequence of OsPPT1a contained a putative mitochondrial sorting signal at the N-terminus and conserved domains for putative substrate-binding sites typical of PPT protein family members
3. __mitochondria__, [Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The subcellular localization of OsPPT1a protein was shown to be mainly in mitochondria based on studies using a green fluorescent protein-PPT fusion
