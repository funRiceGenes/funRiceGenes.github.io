* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsPGIP2 confers Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in Brassica napus through increased activation of defense mechanisms.
    + sclerotiorum resistance in seedling and adult rapeseed, the results reported here demonstrate that OsPGIP2 plays a major role in rapeseed defense mechanisms
    + Our findings indicate that OsPGIP2 can improve disease resistance to S
    + The overexpression of OsPGIP2 also led to constitutively increased cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose content in stems without compromising seed quality
    + The constitutive expression of OsPGIP2 in rapeseed plants provided a rapid and potentiated defense response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, interaction with S
