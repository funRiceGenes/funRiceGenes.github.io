* **Key message**  
    + Here, we established that OsPAO5 expression in rice seedlings is increased in the presence of light, and inhibited by darkness
    + Intriguingly, knocking out of OsPAO5 can remarkably increase the grain weight, grain numbers and yield potential
    + Nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed that an SNP variation (PAO5-578G/A) in the 578 bp upstream of OsPAO5 start codon alters its expression, which is further selected during rice mesocotyl domestication
