* **Key message**  
    + The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.
    + Recombinant OsPKS2 catalyzed the condensation of fatty acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to generate triketide and tetraketide Î±-pyrones, the main components of pollen exine
    + Indeed, the ospks2 mutant had defective exine patterning and was male sterile
    + OsPKS2 is required for rice male fertility by participating in pollen wall formation.
    + Results suggested that OsPKS2 is critical for pollen wall formation, and plays a conserved but differentiated role in sporopollenin biosynthesis from Arabidopsis
    + Two other allelic mutants of OsPKS2 were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and are also completely male sterile
    + This result thus further confirmed that OsPKS2 controls rice male fertility
