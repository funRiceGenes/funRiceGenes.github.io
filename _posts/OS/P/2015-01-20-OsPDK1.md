## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined
2. __growth__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development
3. __leaf__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined
4. __leaf__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h
5. __leaf__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
6. __sheath__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined
7. __sheath__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h
8. __sheath__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
9. __seed__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h
10. __seed__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
11. __gibberellin__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was identified as a gibberellin-up-regulated gene using a cDNA microarray
12. __gibberellin__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development
13. __seedling__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h
