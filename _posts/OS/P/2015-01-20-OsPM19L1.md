* **Key message**  
    + Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that OsPM19L1 was highly expressed in the leaf sheath of rice
    + Interestingly, expression of OsPM19L1 was high at the early stage of panicle development and decreased thereafter
    + qRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsPM19L1 was dramatically induced by 20% PEG stress (&gt;600-fold), exogenous abscisic acid (&gt;350-fold), salt and cold stress
    + Thus, OsPM19L1 appears to be closely associated with stress tolerance through ABA-dependent pathway in rice
    + Characterization of OsPM19L1 encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice.
    + Moreover, under stress conditions, OsPM19L1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates OsPM19L1 gene expression
