## Publication

[Characterization of OsPM19L1 encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of OsPM19L1 encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Genet Mol Res.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that OsPM19L1 was highly expressed in the leaf sheath of rice |  Interestingly, expression of OsPM19L1 was high at the early stage of panicle development and decreased thereafter |  Moreover, under stress conditions, OsPM19L1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates OsPM19L1 gene expression  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
