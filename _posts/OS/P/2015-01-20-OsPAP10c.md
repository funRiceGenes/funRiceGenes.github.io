* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Both the transcript and protein levels of OsPAP10c are strongly induced by Pi starvation
    + OsPAP10c overexpression increased acid phosphatase (APase) activity by more than 10-fold in the culture media and almost fivefold in both roots and leaves under Pi -sufficient and Pi -deficient conditions
