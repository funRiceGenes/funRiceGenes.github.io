* **Key message**  
    + Salt stress induced the recruitment of OsPLC1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, where it hydrolyzed PtdIns4P
    + In addition, the enlargement of grain size was observed in OE plants, however, the reduction of grain size was noticed in osplc1 mutants
    + The increase in the grain size and the grain yield of OE lines were associated with the improvement of cell length and expression levels of a set of genes related to cell expansion, contrarily, the decrease in osplc1 mutant grain size and yield were linked to declined cell length and expression levels of related genes
    + No significant differences, in terms of the grain quality of mature seeds, were found in OE and osplc1 mutants, with compared to those in Nipponbare (Nip)
    + In summary, our study suggests that OsPLC1 could modulate rice flowering time and grain size
    + Preferential expression of OsPLC1 is detected at the heading stage of rice, OsPLC1 overexpression results in early flowering, increased-grain size and yield; however, opposing phenotypes produced in the osplc1 mutants
    + The expression levels of subset genes, which are involved in the control of flowering time in rice, were altered in the plants of OE and osplc1
    + OsPLC1 overexpression (OE) produced rice plants with early flowering, whereas OsPLC1 loss-of-function led to delay in flowering

    + __GF14b~OsGF14b__, __OsPLC1__, [A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.%5BTitle%5D),  Similar to OsPLC1, OsGF14b also positively regulates rice salt tolerance, and their interaction can be promoted by NaCl stress
    + __GF14b~OsGF14b__, __OsPLC1__, [A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.%5BTitle%5D),  OsGF14b also positively regulated the hydrolysis activity of OsPLC1, and is essential to NaCl-induced activation of rice PI-PLCs
    + __GF14b~OsGF14b__, __OsPLC1__, [A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.%5BTitle%5D),  We further discovered that OsPLC1 was degraded via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and OsGF14b could inhibit the ubiquitination of OsPLC1 to protect OsPLC1 from degradation
    + __GF14b~OsGF14b__, __OsPLC1__, [A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.%5BTitle%5D),  Under salt stress, the OsPLC1 protein level in osgf14b was lower than the corresponding value of WT, whereas overexpression of OsGF14b results in a significant increase of OsPLC1 stability
    + __GF14b~OsGF14b__, __OsPLC1__, [A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A 14-3-3 protein positively regulates rice salt tolerance by stabilizing phospholipase C1.%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, we propose that OsGF14b can interact with OsPLC1 and promote its activity and stability, thereby improving rice salt tolerance
