* **Key message**  
    + Salt stress induced the recruitment of OsPLC1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, where it hydrolyzed PtdIns4P
    + In addition, the enlargement of grain size was observed in OE plants, however, the reduction of grain size was noticed in osplc1 mutants
    + The increase in the grain size and the grain yield of OE lines were associated with the improvement of cell length and expression levels of a set of genes related to cell expansion, contrarily, the decrease in osplc1 mutant grain size and yield were linked to declined cell length and expression levels of related genes
    + No significant differences, in terms of the grain quality of mature seeds, were found in OE and osplc1 mutants, with compared to those in Nipponbare (Nip)
    + In summary, our study suggests that OsPLC1 could modulate rice flowering time and grain size
    + Preferential expression of OsPLC1 is detected at the heading stage of rice, OsPLC1 overexpression results in early flowering, increased-grain size and yield; however, opposing phenotypes produced in the osplc1 mutants
    + The expression levels of subset genes, which are involved in the control of flowering time in rice, were altered in the plants of OE and osplc1
    + OsPLC1 overexpression (OE) produced rice plants with early flowering, whereas OsPLC1 loss-of-function led to delay in flowering
