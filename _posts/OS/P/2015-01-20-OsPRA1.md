* **Publication**  
    + [The role of OsPRA1 in vacuolar trafficking by OsRab GTPases in plant system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsPRA1 in vacuolar trafficking by OsRab GTPases in plant system%5BTitle%5D), 2009, Plant Science.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In addition, GFP-fusion analysis demonstrated that OsPRA1 localized to the prevacuolar compartment, and RNA gel blot analysis revealed its significant expression in rice green-aerial tissues such as shoots and mature stems
    + These results suggest that OsPRA1 may function as a Rab effector for vacuolar trafficking in the plant system
