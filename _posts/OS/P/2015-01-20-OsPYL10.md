* **Key message**  
    + Towards elucidating the functions of one of the ABA receptors (ABARs) in rice, OsPYL10 was cloned from drought tolerant rice cv
    + Thus, overall results showed that OsPYL10 overexpression has potential to improve both drought and cold stress tolerance of indica rice
    + At reproductive stage, OsPYL10 transgenic maintained higher RWC, membrane stability index, chlorophyll content, and accumulated lower amount of MDA and H2O2 as compared with WT plants
