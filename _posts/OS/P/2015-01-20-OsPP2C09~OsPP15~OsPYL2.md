* **Key message**  
    + Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
    + OsPP2C09 positively affected plant growth but acted as a negative regulator of drought tolerance through ABA signaling
    + The transcript and protein levels of OsPP2C09 were rapidly induced by exogenous ABA treatments, which suppressed excessive ABA signaling and plant growth arrest
    + This study shed new light on the roles of OsPP2C09 in coordinating plant growth and drought tolerance
    + The OsPP2C09 protein interacted with the core components of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and showed PP2C phosphatase activity in vitro
