* **Key message**  
    + Under normal light conditions, overexpression of OsPG2 decreased the pectin content, but did not affect cell adhesion and sensitivity to biotic stresses
    + Overexpression of OsPG2 in rice under weak light conditions increased the activity of PG, which increased the degradation of pectin in the cell wall, thereby reducing adhesion
