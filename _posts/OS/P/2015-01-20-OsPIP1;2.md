* **Key message**  
    + qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment
    + Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
    + Our results suggest that OsPIP1;2 modulates rice growth and grain yield by facilitating leaf CO2 diffusion, which increases both the net CO2 assimilation rate and sucrose transport
    + Moreover, the grain yield of rice lines overexpressing OsPIP1;2 was determined
    + Here, we investigated the function of the aquaporin OsPIP1;2 in CO2 diffusion-associated photosynthesis and phloem sucrose transport
    + Overexpression of rice aquaporin OsPIP1;2 improves yield by enhancing mesophyll CO2 conductance and phloem sucrose transport.
    + OsPIP1;2 was localized to the plasma membrane and the relative expression of OsPIP1;2 was approximately 5-fold higher in leaves in the presence of an elevated CO2 concentration
