* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic plants with overexpression and repression of OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, respectively, were used for investigation of roles of the genes in Pi-signaling pathway and Pi homeostasis under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions
    + Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi-starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions
    + Phosphate starvation response 1 (PHR1) acts as the central regulator for Pi-signaling and Pi-homeostasis in plants by binding to the cis-element PHR1 binding sequence (P1BS; GNATATNC)
