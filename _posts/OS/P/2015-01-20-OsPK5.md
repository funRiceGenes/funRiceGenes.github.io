* **Key message**  
    + The disruption of OsPK5 function resulted in slow germination and seedling growth during seed germination, blocked glycolytic metabolism, caused glucose accumulation, decreased energy levels, and affected the GA/ABA balance
    + Natural variation in OsPK5 function altered the activity of pyruvate kinase
    + Identification of OsPK5 involved in rice glycolytic metabolism and GA/ABA balance for improving seed germination via genome-wide association study.
    + Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the roles of OsPK5 in seed germination, and facilitate its application in rice breeding to improve seed vigour
