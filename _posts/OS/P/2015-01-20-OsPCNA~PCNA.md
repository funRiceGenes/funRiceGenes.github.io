* **Key message**  
    + Northern and Western blotting analysis revealed that OsPCNA and OsFEN-1 were present in meristematic tissues such as cultured cells, shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem
    + The distribution patterns of plant PCNA and FEN-1 in meiotic cell progression were investigated using microsporocytes of lily (Lilium longiflorum cv
    + The roles of OsPCNA and OsFEN-1 in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles are discussed
    + Characterization of plant proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), and their distribution in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles
    + The biochemical and cell cycle-dependent properties of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) and flap endonuclease-1 (OsFEN-1) were characterized from rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of an immunoreactive PCNA/cyclin protein in the nuclei of cells in the meristem of soybean root tips
    + Immunoblot analysis of the soluble extract of soybean root tips with monospecific anti-PCNA/cyclin identified an immunoreactive protein with an apparent Mr of 34,000
