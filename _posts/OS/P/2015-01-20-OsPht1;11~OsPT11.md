* **Key message**  
    + Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
    + OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function
    + Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
    + OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere
