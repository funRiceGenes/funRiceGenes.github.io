## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter OsPT gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
2. __transporter__, [Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis%5BTitle%5D),  OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity Pi transporter pho84), thereby confirming its function
3. __root__, [Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
4. __phosphate__, [Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter OsPT gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
5. __phosphate__, [Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis%5BTitle%5D),  OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere

## Connection
1. __OsPht1;11~OsPT11__, __OsPht1;13~OsPT13__, [Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family%5BTitle%5D),  To better understand this pathway, we combined genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to determine the specific functions of two symbiosis-specific members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 PHT1 gene family from rice, ORYsa;PHT1;11 PT11 and ORYsa;PHT1;13 PT13)  
2. __OsPht1;11~OsPT11__, __OsPht1;13~OsPT13__, [Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family%5BTitle%5D),  Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis
