* **Key message**  
    + Homologous U-box E3 Ubiquitin Ligases OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 Are Involved in the Positive Regulation of Low Temperature Stress Response in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + In this study, we performed functional analyses of two homologous OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 in response to cold stress (4Â°C)
    + These results suggested that OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 function coordinately in response to cold stress
    + Taken together, these results suggested that the two homologous rice U-box E3 Ub ligases OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 are positive regulators of the response to cold stress
