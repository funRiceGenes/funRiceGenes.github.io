## Key message
1. __phosphate__, [Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPAP2 expression is up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell cultures in the absence of phosphate (P( i ))

3. __insect__, [Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsPAP2 cDNA was expressed as a 69 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
4. __root__, [Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPAP2 expression was responsive to the level of P( i )-supply, and transcripts of OsPAP2 were abundant in P( i )-deprived roots
