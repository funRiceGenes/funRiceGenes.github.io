* **Key message**  
    + OsPAP2 expression is up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell cultures in the absence of phosphate (P( i ))
    + Molecular characterization of OsPAP2: transgenic expression of a purple acid phosphatase up-regulated in phosphate-deprived rice suspension cells
    + The OsPAP2 cDNA was expressed as a 69 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
    + OsPAP2 expression was responsive to the level of P( i )-supply, and transcripts of OsPAP2 were abundant in P( i )-deprived roots
