* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to edit the OsPMEI12 (LOC_Os03G01020) and two mutant pmei12 lines were obtained to explore the functions of OsPMEI in plant growth and development, and under cadmium (Cd) stress
    + These results indicated that OsPMEI12 was involved in the regulation of methyl esterification during growth, affected cell wall composition and agronomic traits, and might play an important role in responses to phytohormones and stress
