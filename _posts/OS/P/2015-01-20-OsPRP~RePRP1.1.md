## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of OsPRP was relatively uniform in the young seedlings
2. __shoot__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  However, tissue-specific expression of OsPRP indicated that shoot tissue accumulates more mRNA, and the root has relatively low expression
3. __root__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  However, tissue-specific expression of OsPRP indicated that shoot tissue accumulates more mRNA, and the root has relatively low expression
4. __jasmonate__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Exogenous application of growth hormones, namely abscisic acid ABA), methyl jasmonate MeJ and ethephon caused significant repression of the OsPRP transcript
5. __submergence__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), " In addition, OsPRP expression is regulated by various environmental factors and is down-regulated under submergence stress
6. __submergence__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa"
7. __growth__, [Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein OsPRP down-regulated during submergence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Exogenous application of growth hormones, namely abscisic acid ABA), methyl jasmonate MeJ and ethephon caused significant repression of the OsPRP transcript
