* **Key message**  
    + The expression of OsPRP was relatively uniform in the young seedlings
    + However, tissue-specific expression of OsPRP indicated that shoot tissue accumulates more mRNA, and the root has relatively low expression
    + Exogenous application of growth hormones, namely abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and ethephon caused significant repression of the OsPRP transcript
    + In addition, OsPRP expression is regulated by various environmental factors and is down-regulated under submergence stress
