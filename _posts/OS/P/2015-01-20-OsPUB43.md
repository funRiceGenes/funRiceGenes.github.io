* **Key message**  
    + CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Mutation in OsPUB43 Improves Grain Length and Weight in Rice by Promoting Cell Proliferation in Spikelet Hull.
    + Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that OsPUB43 modulates the grain size mainly by inhibiting cell proliferation in the spikelet hull
    + Phenotypes of large grain are observed in ospub43 mutants, whereas overexpression of OsPUB43 results in short grains
    + Collectively, our results indicate that OsPUB43 negatively controls the gain size by modulating the expression of BR-responsive genes as well as MADS-box genes that are required for lemma/palea specification, suggesting that OsPUB43 has a potential valuable application in the enlargement of grain size in rice
    + The ospub43 mutants display high sensitivity to exogenous BR, while OsPUB43-OE lines are hyposensitive to BR
    + The OsPUB43 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus
