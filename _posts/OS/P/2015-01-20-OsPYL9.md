    + Precise Editing of the OsPYL9 Gene by RNA-Guided Cas9 Nuclease Confers Enhanced Drought Tolerance and Grain Yield in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) by Regulating Circadian Rhythm and Abiotic Stress Responsive Proteins
    + The OsPYL9 mutants showed an increase in grain yield under both drought and well watered field conditions
    + Thus, the overall results showed that CRISPR/Cas9-generated OsPYL9 mutants have potential to improve both drought tolerance and the yield of rice
    + To elucidate the role of one of the ABA receptors in rice, OsPYL9 was mutagenized through CRISPR/Cas9 in rice
