* **Key message**  
    + The loss of function of OsPGL1 resulted in defects in both chloroplast RNA editing of ndhD-878 and mitochondrial RNA editing of ccmFc-543, both of which could be restored via complementary validation
    + Despite synonymous editing of ccmFc-543, the loss of editing of ndhD-878 caused a failed conversion of serine to leucine, leading to chloroplast dysfunction and defects in the photosynthetic complex; the results of additional experiments demonstrated that OsPGL1 directly binds to both transcripts
    + Here, we identified a rice dual-localized PPR protein, OsPGL1
    + Map-based cloning of this gene revealed that OsPGL1 encodes a chloroplast targeted protein homologous to the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (cpSRP54)
