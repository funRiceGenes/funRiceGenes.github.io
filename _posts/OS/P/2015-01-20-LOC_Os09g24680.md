* **Key message**  
    + The OsPPR1 gene was found to contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide in the N-terminal region, suggesting that the gene product targets to the chloroplast
    + Taken together, the results suggest that the OsPPR1 is a nuclear gene of rice, encoding the PPR protein that might play a role in the chloroplast biogenesis
    + OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis
    + Expression analysis and immunoblot analysis suggested that the OsPPR1 was accumulated mainly in rice leaf
