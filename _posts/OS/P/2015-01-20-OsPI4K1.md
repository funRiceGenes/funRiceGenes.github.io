## Key message
1. __jasmonic acid__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  OsPI4K1 transcript levels were detected in a low but constitutive manner in shoot, stem, leaf, spike and root tissues and did not change upon treatment with different hormones, calcium and jasmonic acid JA)  
2. __leaf__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  OsPI4K1 transcript levels were detected in a low but constitutive manner in shoot, stem, leaf, spike and root tissues and did not change upon treatment with different hormones, calcium and jasmonic acid JA)  
3. __stem__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  OsPI4K1 transcript levels were detected in a low but constitutive manner in shoot, stem, leaf, spike and root tissues and did not change upon treatment with different hormones, calcium and jasmonic acid JA)  
4. __tillering__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  cDNA clone, OsPI4K1c, was isolated through screening of a cDNA library constructed from tillering materials
5. __tiller__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  cDNA clone, OsPI4K1c, was isolated through screening of a cDNA library constructed from tillering materials
6. __salicylic acid__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  However, treatment with salicylic acid SA elevated the mRNA level of the OsPI4K1 gene, which suggested the involvement of OsPI4K1 in wounding responses
7. __root__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  OsPI4K1 transcript levels were detected in a low but constitutive manner in shoot, stem, leaf, spike and root tissues and did not change upon treatment with different hormones, calcium and jasmonic acid JA)  
8. __jasmonic__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  OsPI4K1 transcript levels were detected in a low but constitutive manner in shoot, stem, leaf, spike and root tissues and did not change upon treatment with different hormones, calcium and jasmonic acid JA)  
9. __ pi __, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  Further comparison with genomic sequences in databases revealed that OsPI4K1c is located at the 3'-end of a putative rice PI 4-kinase coding gene OsPI4K1, and its coding region corresponded to the C-terminal half of OsPI4K1 protein
10. __shoot__, [Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and functional characterization of the C-terminus of rice phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase in vitro%5BTitle%5D),  OsPI4K1 transcript levels were detected in a low but constitutive manner in shoot, stem, leaf, spike and root tissues and did not change upon treatment with different hormones, calcium and jasmonic acid JA)
