* **Key message**  
    + Under Pi-sufficient conditions, Pi levels were lower in young leaves and higher in old leaves in ospp95 mutants than in those of the wild type, even though the overall shoot Pi levels were the same in the mutant and the wild type
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsPP95 reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation
    + In the wild type, OsPP95 accumulated under Pi starvation but was rapidly degraded under Pi-sufficient conditions
    + We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
