## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: OsPCR1-knockout and -knockdown lines produced lighter grains than the wild type, while OsPCR1-overexpression lines produced heavier grains  
__OverExpression__: OsPCR1-knockout and -knockdown lines produced lighter grains than the wild type, while OsPCR1-overexpression lines produced heavier grains  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __cadmium__, [Rice PCR1 influences grain weight and Zn accumulation in grains.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice PCR1 influences grain weight and Zn accumulation in grains.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the grains of OsPCR1-knockdown lines exhibited substantially higher Zn and lower cadmium (Cd) concentrations than the control, as did yeast heterologously expressing OsPCR1

## Connection
