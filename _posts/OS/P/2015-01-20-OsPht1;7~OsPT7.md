* **Key message**  
    + A further fine-localization analysis by immunostaining showed that OsPHT1;7 expression was restricted in the vascular bundle sheath and phloem of source leaves and enlarged-vascular bundles of nodes
    + Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsPHT1;7 is a crucial Pi transporter for Pi transport and recycling within rice plants, stimulating both the vegetative and reproductive growth
    + Moreover, the germination of pollen grains was significantly inhibited upon OsPHT1;7 mutation, leading to a<e2><80><U+383C><U+3E39>&gt;<e2><80><U+383C><U+3E39>80% decrease in seed-setting rate and grain yield
    + The Rice Phosphate Transporter OsPHT1;7 Plays a Dual Role in Phosphorus Redistribution and Anther Development.
    + Yeast complementation and Xenopus laevis oocyte assay demonstrated that OsPHT1;7 could mediate Pi transport

* **Connection**  
    + __OsMYB4P__, __OsPht1;7~OsPT7__, [Overexpression of OsMYB4P, an R2R3-type MYB transcriptional activator, increases phosphate acquisition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsMYB4P, an R2R3-type MYB transcriptional activator, increases phosphate acquisition in rice%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression of OsMYB4P led to greater expression of Pi transporter-family proteins OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT4, OsPT7, and OsPT8 in shoots, and to decreased or unchanged expression of these proteins in roots, with the exception of OsPT8.
