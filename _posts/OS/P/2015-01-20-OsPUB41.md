* **Key message**  
    + In rice, transient overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to enhanced expression of PR genes and SA as well as JA biosynthetic and response genes
    + However, in Arabidopsis, ectopic expression of OsPUB41 results in upregulation of only JA biosynthetic and response genes
    + This indicates that the E3 ligase activity of OsPUB41 protein is essential for induction of plant defense responses
    + Overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to induction of callose deposition, enhanced tolerance to Xoo and Rhizoctonia solani infection in rice and Arabidopsis respectively
    + Transient overexpression of either of the two biochemically inactive mutants (OsPUB41C40A and OsPUB41V51R) of OsPUB41 in rice and stable transgenics in Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OsPUB41C40A failed to elicit immune responses
    + The results presented here suggest that OsPUB41 is possibly involved in elicitation of CWDE triggered immune responses in rice
    + OsPUB41 plays a negative role in drought stress response through the mediation of OsUBC25 and interacts with OsCLC6, suggesting a putative substrate
    + The Ubi:RNAi-OsPUB41 knock-down and ospub41 suppression mutant plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild-type rice plants in terms of transpirational water loss, long-term dehydration response, and chlorophyll content
    + OsPUB41 expression was specifically induced by dehydration among various abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments
