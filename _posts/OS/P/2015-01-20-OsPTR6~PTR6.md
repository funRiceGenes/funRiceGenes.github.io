## Publication
1. [Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Plant Sci.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__:Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply. |  The expression of OsATM1 genes in over-expression lines showed that the OsPTR6 over expression increased OsAMT1 |  These data suggest that over-expression of the OsPTR6 gene could increase rice growth through increasing ammonium transporter expression and glutamine synthetase activity (GSA), but decreases nitrogen use efficiency under conditions of high ammonium supply  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
