* **Key message**  
    + Here we report that decreased expression of OsPDCD5 caused by antisense technology could induce pollen sterility in photoperiod-sensitive rice
    + Constitutive expression of OsPDCD5 from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter induced programmed cell death (PCD) in transgenic rice
    + Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice
    + In F1 hybrids made from transgenic plants with antisense-OsPDCD5 and japonica rice varieties, lower transcript inhibition could restore fertility, under certain photoperiod and temperatures
    + OsPDCD5, is an ortholog to mammalian programmed cell death 5 gene
    + ) programmed cell death 5 (OsPDCD5) gene in rice plant
    + Overexpression of the OsPDCD5 gene induces programmed cell death in rice
    + Transcriptome analysis showed that OsPDCD5 knockout affected auxin biosynthesis, as well as the gibberellin and cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling pathways
    + Targeted mutagenesis of OsPDCD5 enhanced grain yield and improved plant architecture by increasing plant height and optimizing panicle type and grain shape
    + OsPDCD5 negatively regulates plant architecture and grain yield in rice
    + OsPDCD5 interacted directly with OsAGAP, and OsAGAP positively regulated plant architecture and grain yield in rice
    + Collectively, these findings demonstrate that OsPDCD5 is a promising candidate gene for breeding super rice cultivars with increased yield potential and superior quality
