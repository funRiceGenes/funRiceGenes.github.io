* **Key message**  
    + OsPDR2 showed variable levels of relative expression pattern in vegetative and/or reproductive tissues analyzed at different stages of growth and development (5-17 weeks)
    + OsPDR2 mediates the regulation on the development response and maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice.
    + The study revealed significant inhibitory effects of RNAi-mediated suppression of OsPDR2 on the development of root, male reproductive traits, and yield
    + Moreover, 32P isotope labeling and split-root experiments under different Pi regime with RNAi lines revealed the function of OsPDR2 in regulating homeostasis of Pi
    + Therefore, qRT-PCR was employed to determine the spatiotemporal effects and the availability of Pi on the expression of OsPDR2
