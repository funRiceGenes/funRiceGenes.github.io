* **Key message**  
    + Findings: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsProDH transcript contents were relatively higher in leaf blade and root tissues and the high temperature treatment repressed expression of OsProDH
    + Heat stress induced proline accumulation and mutation of OsProDH led to proline overproduction which reduced H2O2 accumulation in the seedlings
    + The predicted OsProDH protein localized in mitochondria
    + However, whether OsProDH plays roles in abiotic stress in rice remains unknown
    + OsProDH Negatively Regulates Thermotolerance in Rice by Modulating Proline Metabolism and Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging
    + OsProDH encodes a putative proline dehydrogenase and is a single copy gene in rice
