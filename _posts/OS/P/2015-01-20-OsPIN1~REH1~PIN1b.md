* **Key message**  
    + Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the OsPIN1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor)-treated wild-type plants
    + Taken together, these data suggest that OsPIN1 plays an important role in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering
    + A PIN1 family gene, OsPIN1, involved in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering in rice
    + OsPIN1 was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1
    + Overexpression or suppression of the OsPIN1 expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio
    + REH1, a rice EIR1 (Arabidopsis ethylene insensitive root 1)-like gene, is a putative auxin efflux carrier
