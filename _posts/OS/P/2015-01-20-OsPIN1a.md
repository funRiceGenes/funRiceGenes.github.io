* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation

* **Connection**  
    + __OsPID~OsPINOID__, __OsPIN1a__, [PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Our data demonstrate that OsPID interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously
