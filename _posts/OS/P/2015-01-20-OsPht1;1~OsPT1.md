* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) Pht1;1 (OsPT1), one of the 13 Pht1 Pi transporters in rice, was expressed abundantly and constitutively in various cell types of both roots and shoots
    + OsPT1 was able to complement the proton-coupled Pi transporter activities in a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake
    + Transgenic plants of OsPT1 overexpression lines and RNA interference knockdown lines contained significantly higher and lower phosphorus concentrations, respectively, compared with the wild-type control in Pi-sufficient shoots
    + OsPT1, however, was highly expressed in primary roots and leaves regardless of external phosphate concentrations
    + This finding was confirmed histochemically using transgenic rice plants that express the GUS reporter gene under the control of the OsPT1 promoter, which exhibited high GUS activity even in the phosphate sufficient condition
    + Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsPT1 gene accumulated almost twice as much phosphate in the shoots as did wild-type plants
    + Increased expression of OsPT1, a high-affinity phosphate transporter, enhances phosphate acquisition in rice
    + Furthermore, OsPT1 expression was strongly enhanced by the mutation of Phosphate Overaccumulator2 (OsPHO2) but not by Phosphate Starvation Response2, indicating that OsPT1 is involved in the OsPHO2-regulated Pi pathway
    + A constitutive expressed phosphate transporter, OsPht1;1, modulates phosphate uptake and translocation in phosphate-replete rice
    + Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
    + OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function
    + These results indicate that OsPT1 is a key member of the Pht1 family involved in Pi uptake and translocation in rice under Pi-replete conditions
    + OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere
    + Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
