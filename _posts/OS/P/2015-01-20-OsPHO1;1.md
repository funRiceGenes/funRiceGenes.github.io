* **Key message**  
    + The Involvement of OsPHO1;1 in the Regulation of Iron Transport Through Integration of Phosphate and Zinc Deficiency Signaling.
    + OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles
    + Taken together, OsPHO1;2 expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds
    + At the reproductive stage, both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 showed higher expression in the node I, the uppermost node connecting to panicle
    + Furthermore, OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 expressed in the caryopsis are important for delivering of P from the maternal tissues to the filial tissues for seed development
    + Knockout of OsPHO1;2 as well as OsPHO1;1 with less extent decreased the distribution of P to the seed, resulting in decreased seed size and delayed germination
    + Both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 were localized to the plasma membrane and showed influx transport activities for inorganic phosphate
