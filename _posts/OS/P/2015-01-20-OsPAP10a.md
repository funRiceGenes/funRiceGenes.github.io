* **Key message**  
    + In gel activity assays of root and shoot protein extracts, it was revealed that OsPAP10a is a major acid phosphatase isoform induced by Pi starvation
    + Constitutive overexpression of OsPAP10a results in a significant increase of phosphatase activity in both shoot and root protein extracts
    + In vivo root 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) assays and activity measurements on external media showed that OsPAP10a is a root-associated APase
    + Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice
    + The transcript abundance of OsPAP10a is specifically induced by Pi deficiency and is controlled by OsPHR2, the central transcription factor controlling Pi homeostasis
    + These results indicate that OsPAP10a can potentially be used for crop breeding to improve the efficiency of P use
