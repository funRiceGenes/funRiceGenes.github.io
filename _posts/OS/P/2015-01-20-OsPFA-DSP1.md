* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in tobacco increased sensitivity to drought stress and insensitivity to ABA-induced stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening
    + Quantitative real-time PCR and GENEVESTIGATOR analysis showed that OsPFA-DSP1 mRNA was induced by drought stress
    + Furthermore, overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in rice also increased sensitivity to drought stress
    + These results indicated that OsPFA-DSP1 is a functional PTP and may act as a negative regulator in drought stress responses
    + OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants
