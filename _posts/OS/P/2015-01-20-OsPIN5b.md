* **Key message**  
    + Over-expression of the auxin efflux carrier-like gene OsPIN5b causes pleiotropic effects, mainly reducing plant height, leaf and tiller number, shoot and root biomass, seed setting rate, panicle length and yield parameters
    + Conversely, reduced expression of OsPIN5b results in higher tiller number, more vigorous root system, longer panicles and increased yield
    + OsPIN5b modulates rice plant architecture and yield by changing auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution.
    + We show that OsPIN5b is an ER-localized protein that participates in auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution in vivo
