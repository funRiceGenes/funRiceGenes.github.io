    + Symbol: OsPDF1B  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os01g45070](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g45070)

* **Publication**  
    + [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D), 2008, Plant Cell Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [EU213046](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU213046)

* **Key message**  
    + OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves
    + Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
    + Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria
