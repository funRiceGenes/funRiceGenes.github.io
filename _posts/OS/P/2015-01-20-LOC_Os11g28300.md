* **Key message**  
    + OsPML3 was highly expressed in rapidly developing tissues such as young leaves, root caps, lateral root primordia, and young anthers
    + At the vegetative stage, we observed necrotic root tips and lateral root primordia, and chlorotic young leaves in OsPML3 knockout lines under Mn-deficient conditions
    + Heterologous expression of OsPML3 restored the growth of Mn uptake-defective yeast strain Î”smf1 under Mn-limited conditions
    + OsPML3 knockout lines grown in the paddy field had reduced pollen fertility
    + The Golgi-localized transporter OsPML3 is involved in manganese homeostasis and complex N-glycan synthesis in rice.
    + Collectively, our results indicate that OsPML3 maintains Mn homeostasis in the Golgi apparatus of the rapidly developing rice tissues, and regulates the deposition of cell wall polysaccharides and late-stage Golgi N-glycosylation, especially biosynthesis of the Lewis A structure
    + Additionally, knocking out OsPML3 reduced the deposition of cell wall polysaccharides and the content of Lea (Lewis A structure)-containing N-glycan in roots and young leaves
