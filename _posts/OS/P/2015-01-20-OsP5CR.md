* **Key message**  
    + Under salt stress, topical ABA application-induced OsP5CS1 gene expression only in the salt-resistant line but up-regulated OsP5CR gene expression in both rice lines, suggesting that the increased proline accumulation and salt resistance induced by topical ABA application may result from the up-regulation of OsP5CR and not, directly at least, from OsP5CS1

    + These data suggest the role of the calmodulin signaling cascade and the induction of OsP5CR gene expression in proline accumulation by exogenous ABA application
