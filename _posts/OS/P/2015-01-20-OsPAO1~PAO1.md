* **Key message**  
    + AtPAO1 seems to have a specific function in flower organ
    + Expression of OsPAO1 appears to be quite low under physiological conditions, but is markedly induced in rice roots by spermine (Spm) or T-Spm treatment
    + Of the seven PAOs, OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5 transcripts were most abundant in 2-week-old seedlings and mature plants, while OsPAO1, OsPAO2, OsPAO6, and OsPAO7 were expressed at very low levels with different tissue specificities
