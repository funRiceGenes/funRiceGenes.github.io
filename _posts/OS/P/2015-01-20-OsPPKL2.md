* **Publication**  
    + [Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2012, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic studies showed that OsPPKL1 and OsPPKL3 function as negative regulators of grain length, whereas OsPPKL2 as a positive regulator
