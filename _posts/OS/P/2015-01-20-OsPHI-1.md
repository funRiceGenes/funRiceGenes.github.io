    + __OsPHI-1__, __SMOS1~SHB~RLA1~NGR5__, [A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D), Among the down-regulated genes, we demonstrated by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that OsPHI-1, which is involved in cell expansion, is a target of SMOS1
