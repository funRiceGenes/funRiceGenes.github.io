* **Key message**  
    + Although PSK-α molecules have never been identified in any intact plant, reverse transcription–PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPSK is expressed in rice seedlings, indicating that PSK-α may be important for plant cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo
    + We previously characterized an OsPSK cDNA encoding a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a peptide plant growth factor
    + Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin
