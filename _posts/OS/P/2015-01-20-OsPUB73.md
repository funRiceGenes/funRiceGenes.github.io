    + Cytological and transcriptome analyses reveal OsPUB73 defect affects the gene expression associated with tapetum or pollen exine abnormality in rice.
    + In the present study, we knocked out OsPUB73 by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and studied the cytological and transcriptome of the gene-defect associated with pollen development and sterility in the rice variety (Taichung 65)
    + The ospub73 displayed low pollen fertility (19
    + Cytological observation showed tapetum vacuolated at the meiosis stage and pollen exine was abnormal at the bi-cellular pollen stage of ospub73
    + These results suggested OsPUB73 may play an important role in tapetal or pollen exine development and resulted in pollen partial sterility
    + The expression pattern of OsPUB73 showed that it was highly expressed in the anther during meiosis stage
    + RNA-seq analysis detected 2240 down and 571 up-regulated genes in anther of ospub73 compared with WT during meiosis stage
    + Our results revealed that OsPUB73 plays an important role in rice male reproductive development, which provides valuable information about the molecular mechanisms of the U-box in rice male reproductive development
