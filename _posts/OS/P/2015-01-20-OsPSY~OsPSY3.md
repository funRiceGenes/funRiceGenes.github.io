* **Key message**  
    + Rather, OsPSY3 transcripts are up-regulated during increased abscisic acid (ABA) formation upon salt treatment and drought, especially in roots

    + __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY2__, [PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis%5BTitle%5D), PSY3 was the only paralog for which transcripts were induced in roots and abiotic stress also affected leaf PSY2 transcript levels; PSY1 mRNA was not elevated in any tissues tested
    + __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY1__, [PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis%5BTitle%5D), PSY3 was the only paralog for which transcripts were induced in roots and abiotic stress also affected leaf PSY2 transcript levels; PSY1 mRNA was not elevated in any tissues tested

    + __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY1__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D), The investigation of the gene structures and 5' untranslated regions revealed that OsPSY1 represents a descendant of an ancient PSY gene present in the common ancestor of monocots and dicots
