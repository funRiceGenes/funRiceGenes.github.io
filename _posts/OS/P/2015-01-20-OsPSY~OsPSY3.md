## Key message
1. __root__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D),  Rather, OsPSY3 transcripts are up-regulated during increased abscisic acid ABA formation upon salt treatment and drought, especially in roots
2. __drought__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D), " Rather, OsPSY3 transcripts are up-regulated during increased abscisic acid ABA formation upon salt treatment and drought, especially in roots"
3. __salt__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D), " Rather, OsPSY3 transcripts are up-regulated during increased abscisic acid ABA formation upon salt treatment and drought, especially in roots"

## Connection
1. __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY2__, [PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  PSY3 was the only paralog for which transcripts were induced in roots and abiotic stress also affected leaf PSY2 transcript levels; PSY1 mRNA was not elevated in any tissues tested
2. __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY1__, [PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis%5BTitle%5D),  PSY3 was the only paralog for which transcripts were induced in roots and abiotic stress also affected leaf PSY2 transcript levels; PSY1 mRNA was not elevated in any tissues tested
3. __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY1__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D),  The regulatory differences are mirrored by cis-acting elements in the corresponding promoter regions, with light-responsive elements for OsPSY1 and OsPSY2 and an ABA-response element as well as a coupling element for OsPSY3
4. __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY1__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D),  The investigation of the gene structures and 5' untranslated regions revealed that OsPSY1 represents a descendant of an ancient PSY gene present in the common ancestor of monocots and dicots
5. __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY1__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D),  Since the genomic structures of OsPSY2 and OsPSY3 are comparable, we conclude that they originated from the most recent common ancestor, OsPSY1
6. __OsPSY~OsPSY3__, __PSY2__, [A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes%5BTitle%5D),  The regulatory differences are mirrored by cis-acting elements in the corresponding promoter regions, with light-responsive elements for OsPSY1 and OsPSY2 and an ABA-response element as well as a coupling element for OsPSY3
