    + E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 destabilises the B-lectin receptor-like kinase PID2 to control blast disease resistance in rice.
    + The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 (PID2-interacting E3) was isolated and confirmed to play key roles in PID2-mediated rice blast resistance
    + Genetic analysis suggested that OsPIE3 loss-of-function mutants exhibited enhanced resistance to M
    + oryzae isolate ZB15, whereas mutants with overexpressed OsPIE3 exhibited reduced resistance
    + Furthermore, the OsPIE3/PID2-double mutant displayed a similar blast phenotype to that of the PID2 single mutant, suggesting that OsPIE3 is a negative regulator and functions along with PID2 in blast disease resistance
    + Our findings confirm that the E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 is necessary for PID2-mediated rice blast disease resistance regulation
    + Further investigation demonstrated that OsPIE3 can modify the subcellular localisation of PID2, thus promoting its nuclear recruitment from the plasma membrane for protein degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system
    + Mechanistic investigations revealed that OsPUB16 mediated the ubiquitination and degradation of OsMADS23, which is the substrate of OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9) and increases rice drought tolerance by promoting ABA biosynthesis
    + Loss-of-function mutants of OsPUB16 generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited the markedly enhanced water-deficit tolerance, while OsPUB16 overexpression lines were hypersensitive to water deficit stress
    + Rice OsPUB16 modulates the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to reduce plant water-deficit tolerance by repressing ABA and JA biosynthesis.
    + Moreover, OsPUB16 negatively regulated ABA and JA response, and ospub16 mutants produced more endogenous ABA and JA than wild type when exposed to water deficit
    + Collectively, our findings establish that OsPUB16 reduces plant water-deficit tolerance by modulating the &#x27;SAPK9-OsMADS23-OsAOC&#x27; pathway to repress ABA and JA biosynthesis
