* **Key message**  
    + Subsequent haplotype and sequence analyses indicated that OsPH9 was the most probable candidate gene for plant height at this locus, and functional analysis of osph9 CRISPR/Cas9-generated OsPH9 knockout mutants supported this conclusion
    + CONCLUSION: OsPH9 was identified as a novel regulatory gene associated with plant height in rice, along with a height-reducing allele in &#x27;Dongfu-114&#x27; rice, thereby representing an important molecular target for rice improvement
