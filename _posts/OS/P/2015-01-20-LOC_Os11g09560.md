* **Key message**  
    + Root-secreted peptide OsPEP1 regulates primary root elongation in rice
    + OsPEP1 was expressed highly in root tissues, especially root cap cells and epidermal cells in the root maturation zone
    + Notably, OsPEP1 RNA interference (RNAi) lines had short primary roots with small meristems and short cells in the root elongation zone; furthermore, the short root phenotype of OsPEP1 RNAi plants could be rescued by exogenous application of PEP1
