* **Key message**  
    + All together, these results suggest the possibility that OsPIF14 is involved in cross-talk between light and stress signaling through interaction with the OsDREB1B promoter
    + Although in the absence of stress, OsDREB1B gene expression was not regulated by light, given previous reports, it remains possible that OsPIF14 has a role in light modulation of stress responses
    + Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.
    + We have shown that OsPIF14 binds to the OsDREB1B promoter through two N-boxes and that the flanking regions of the hexameric core are essential for protein-DNA interaction and stability
    + Moreover, OsPIF14 gene expression was shown to be modulated by different treatments, such as drought, salt, cold and ABA
    + Furthermore, salt induces OsPIL14 turnover but enhances SLR1 accumulation
    + OsPIL14 directly binds to the promoter of cell elongation-related genes and regulates their expression
