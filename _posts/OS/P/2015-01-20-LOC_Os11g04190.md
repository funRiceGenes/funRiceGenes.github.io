* **Key message**  
    + These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
    + Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
    + In addition to significantly decreased plant height and tiller number, panicle development was severely disrupted in double mutant lines of OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d
    + Additionally, several critical regulators of reproductive development, such as OsPID, LAX1, OsMADS1, and OsSPL14/IPA1, were differentially expressed in ospin1c-1 ospin1d-1, supporting the hypothesis that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d are involved in regulating panicle development
    + Auxin Efflux Transporters OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d Function Redundantly in Regulating Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Panicle Development.
    + Results showed that OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d were mainly expressed in young panicles and exhibited a redundant function
