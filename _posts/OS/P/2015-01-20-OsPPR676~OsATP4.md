* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of OsPPR676 resulted in growth retardation of plants and partial sterility of pollens
    + In this study, OsPPR676 was confirmed to be an interacted protein with Osj10gBTF3, β-subunit of nascent polypeptide-associated complex (β-NAC), by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating that both proteins are probably involved in the same regulatory pathway of pollen development
    + Compared with other chloroplast-rich tissues, OsPPR676 was only weakly expressed in anther, but in the Mei and YM stages of pollen development, its expression was relatively strong in the tapetum
    + osatp4 mutants were chlorotic and had a plastid-ribosome deficiency when grown in the cold
    + Expression of the edited rps8 isoform in transgenic osatp4 mutants complemented the cold-sensitive phenotype, indicating that a rps8 expression defect accounts for the cold sensitivity
