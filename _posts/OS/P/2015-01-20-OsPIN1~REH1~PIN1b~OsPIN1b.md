* **Key message**  
    + Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the OsPIN1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor)-treated wild-type plants
    + Taken together, these data suggest that OsPIN1 plays an important role in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering
    + A PIN1 family gene, OsPIN1, involved in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering in rice
    + OsPIN1 was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1
    + Overexpression or suppression of the OsPIN1 expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio
    + REH1, a rice EIR1 (Arabidopsis ethylene insensitive root 1)-like gene, is a putative auxin efflux carrier
    + These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation
    + Mutation of OsPIN1b resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes, including decreased growth of shoots and primary roots, reduced adventitious root number in rice seedlings, as well as shorter and narrower leaves, increased leaf angle, more tiller number and decreased plant height and panicle length at the late developmental stage
    + Mutation of OsPIN1b by CRISPR/Cas9 Reveals a Role for Auxin Transport in Modulating Rice Architecture and Root Gravitropism.
    + In the present study, OsPIN1b was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and its roles in modulating rice architecture and root gravitropism were investigated
    + IAA homeostasis was disturbed in ospin1b mutants, as evidenced by the changed sensitivity of shoot and root to NAA and NPA treatment, respectively
    + Moreover, ospin1b mutants displayed a curly root phenotype cultured with tap water regardless of lighting conditions, while nutrient solution culture could partially rescue the curly root phenotype in light and almost completely abolish this phenotype in darkness, indicating the involvement of the integration of light and nutrient signals in root gravitropism regulation
    + Additionally, amyloplast sedimentation was impaired in the peripheral tiers of the ospin1b root cap columella cell, while it was not the main contributor to the abnormal root gravitropism
    + These data suggest that OsPIN1b not only plays a vital role in regulating rice architecture but also functions in regulating root gravitropism by the integration of light and nutrient signals
    + Tissue-specific analysis showed that OsPIN1b was mainly expressed in roots, stems and sheaths at the seedling stage, and the transcript abundance was progressively decreased during the seedling stages
    + Here, we reveal a novel regulator of leaf inclination, auxin transporter OsPIN1b
    + The OsPIN1b was localized on the plasma membrane, and the free IAA contents in the lamina joint of ospin1b mutants were significantly increased while they were decreased in OE-OsPIN1b lines, suggesting that OsPIN1b might action an auxin transporter such as AtPIN1 to alter IAA content and leaf inclination
    + Furthermore, the OsPIN1b expression was induced by exogenous epibrassinolide (24-eBL) and IAA, and ospin1b mutants are insensitive to BR or IAA treatment, indicating that the effecting leaf inclination is regulated by OsPIN1b
