* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, we identified an AT-hook transcription factor, OsATH1, that specifically bound to the OsPrx30 promoter
    + Overexpression of OsPrx30 enhanced the plant's susceptibility to Xoo by maintaining a high level of peroxidase (POD) activity and reducing the content of H2 O2 , while depletion of OsPrx30 had the opposite effects
