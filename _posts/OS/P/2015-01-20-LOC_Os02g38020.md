* **Key message**  
    + Cell-based assays showed that OsPHT2;1 localized to the chloroplast envelope and functioned as a low-affinity Pi transporter
    + The ospht2;1 had reduced Pi accumulation, plant growth and photosynthetic rates
    + Furthermore, the ospht2;1 showed decreased grain yields at relatively high levels of UV-B irradiance
    + Mutation of the chloroplast-localized phosphate transporter OsPHT2;1 reduces flavonoids accumulation and UV tolerance in rice.
    + In summary, OsPHT2;1 functions as a chloroplast-localized low-affinity Pi transporter that mediates UV tolerance and rice yields in different latitudes
    + In this study, to gain insight into the role of OsPHT2;1-mediated stroma Pi, we analyzed OsPHT2;1 function in Pi utilization and photoprotection
    + Our results showed that OsPHT2;1 was induced by Pi starvation and light exposure
