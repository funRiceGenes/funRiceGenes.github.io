* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, our findings have clarified the OsPAGN1 functions related to rice growth and grain development
    + We demonstrated that OsPAGN1 can interact directly with OsCNR10 (CELL NUMBER REGULATOR10), which negatively regulates the number of rice grains per panicle
    + Thus, OsPAGN1 may be useful for the genetic improvement of plant architecture and yield
