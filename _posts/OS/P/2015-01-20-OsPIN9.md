* **Key message**  
    + Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast demonstrated that OsPIN9 is a functional auxin efflux transporter
    + Compared with wild-type plants, ospin9 mutants had fewer tillers, and OsPIN9 overexpression increased the tiller number
    + Additionally, OsPIN9 was mainly expressed in vascular tissue of the junction and tiller buds, and encoded a membrane-localised protein
    + Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
    + The results showed that OsPIN9 expression was dramatically and rapidly suppressed by chilling stress (4Â°C) in rice seedlings
    + CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation in auxin efflux carrier OsPIN9 confers chilling tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis in rice.
    + ospin9 mutant roots and shoots were less sensitive to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), indicating the disturbance of auxin homeostasis in the ospin9 mutants
    + The chilling tolerance assay showed that ospin9 mutants were more tolerant to chilling stress than wild-type (WT) plants, as evidenced by increased survival rate, decreased membrane permeability, and reduced lipid peroxidation
    + However, the expression of well-known C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF)/DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (DREB)-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway and Ca(2+) signaling genes was significantly induced only under normal conditions, implying that defense responses in ospin9 mutants have probably been triggered in advance under normal conditions
    + Consistently, antioxidant enzyme activity, including catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), improved significantly during the early chilling treatments, while was kept similar to WT at the later stage of chilling treatment, implying that the enhanced chilling tolerance of ospin9 mutants is mainly attributed to the earlier induction of ROS and the improved ROS scavenging ability at the subsequent stages of chilling treatment
    + In summary, our results strongly suggest that the OsPIN9 gene regulates chilling tolerance by modulating ROS homeostasis in rice
    + Histochemical staining of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 3&#x27;3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) showed that ospin9 mutants accumulated more ROS than WT at the early stage of chilling stress, while less ROS was observed at the later stage of chilling treatment in ospin9 mutants
