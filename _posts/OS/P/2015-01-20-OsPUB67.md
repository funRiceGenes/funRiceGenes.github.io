* **Key message**  
    + A U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPUB67 is positively involved in drought tolerance in rice.
    + Over-expression of OsPUB67 improved drought stress tolerance by enhancing the reactive oxygen scavenging ability and stomatal closure
    + This interaction on the stomata implied OsPUB67 might function as a heterodimeric ubiquitination complex in response to drought stress
    + Our findings revealed OsPUB67 mediated a multilayered complex drought stress tolerance mechanism
    + This distribution of expression suggests a significant role for OsPUB67 in a wide range of biological processes and abiotic stress response
    + Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed OsPUB67 participated in regulating genes involved in the abiotic stress response and transcriptional regulation in an ABA-dependent manner
