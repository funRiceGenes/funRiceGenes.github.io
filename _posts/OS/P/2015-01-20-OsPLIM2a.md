* **Key message**  
    + Rice LIM protein OsPLIM2a is involved in rice seed and tiller development
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing OsPLIM2a produced bigger seeds than wild type, whereas they exhibited reduction in tiller numbers
    + These results suggest that OsPLIM2a may participate positively in seed development but negatively in tiller differentiation
