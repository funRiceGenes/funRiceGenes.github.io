* **Key message**  
    + The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation
    + Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant
    + Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant
    + Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.
    + ) has two PCSs (OsPCS1 and OsPCS2), and we previously revealed that OsPCS1 has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while OsPCS2 has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic
    + A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS2 were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS1 showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to OsPCS1
