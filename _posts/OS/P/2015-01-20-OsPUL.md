## Key message
1. __starch__, [Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
2. __grain filling__, [Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
