* **Key message**  
    + The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism
    + The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages
    + Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice
    + In addition, the 1177-bp OsPUL promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region
    + The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the OsPUL promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression
    + Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination
    + In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages
