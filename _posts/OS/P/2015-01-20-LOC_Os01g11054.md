* **Key message**  
    + ) has a plant-type PEPC, Osppc4, that is targeted to the chloroplast
    + Knockdown of Osppc4 expression by the RNAi technique resulted in stunting at the vegetative stage, which was much more marked when rice plants were grown with ammonium than with nitrate as the nitrogen source
    + Its expression in the leaves was confined to mesophyll cells, and Osppc4 accounted for approximately one-third of total PEPC protein in the leaf blade

    + __Osppc2a__, __Osppc4__, [Comparison of plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from rice: identification of two plant-specific regulatory regions of the allosteric enzyme.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Comparison of plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from rice: identification of two plant-specific regulatory regions of the allosteric enzyme.%5BTitle%5D),  One is the N-terminal extension; replacement of the extension of Osppc2a (cytosolic) with that from Osppc4 reduced the aspartate and glutamate sensitivities to about one-tenth of the wild-type values but left the PEP affinity unaffected
    + __Osppc2a__, __Osppc4__, [Comparison of plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from rice: identification of two plant-specific regulatory regions of the allosteric enzyme.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Comparison of plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from rice: identification of two plant-specific regulatory regions of the allosteric enzyme.%5BTitle%5D),  Replacement of the lysine of Osppc2a with glutamate-alanine lowered the PEP affinity to a quarter of the wild-type level (down to the Osppc4 level), without affecting inhibitor sensitivity
