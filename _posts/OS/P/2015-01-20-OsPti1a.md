* **Key message**  
    + The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with OsPti1a, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice
    + We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice
    + Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice
    + To investigate the molecular function of OsPti1a in defense responses, we searched for components interacting with OsPti1a using a yeast two-hybrid system
    + Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of OsPti1a, causing the release from an OsPti1a-dependent inhibition of the responses
    + OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr-233 of OsPti1a and a point mutation of Thr-233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in OsPti1a is necessary to activate defense responses; however, the regulatory mechanism of OsPti1a-mediated immune responses is still obscure
    + Recently, we revealed that OsPti1a forms protein complex(es) at the plasma membrane and this localization is required for its function
    + These results suggest that OsPti1a protein is selectively regulated by its phosphorylation after OsPti1a localizes to the plasma membrane
    + OsPti1a (Pto-interacting protein 1a) has important roles in the regulation of immune responses in rice
