* **Key message**  
    + OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
    + We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 showed significantly higher water loss than control
