* **Key message**  
    + The disruption of OsPK5 function resulted in slow germination and seedling growth during seed germination, blocked glycolytic metabolism, caused glucose accumulation, decreased energy levels, and affected the GA/ABA balance
    + Natural variation in OsPK5 function altered the activity of pyruvate kinase
    + Identification of OsPK5 involved in rice glycolytic metabolism and GA/ABA balance for improving seed germination via genome-wide association study.
    + Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the roles of OsPK5 in seed germination, and facilitate its application in rice breeding to improve seed vigour

    + __OsPK5__, __OsSAP6__, [OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsSAP6 interacts with OsPK5 according to yeast two-hybrid screening and luciferase complementation experiments
    + __OsPK5__, __OsSAP6__, [OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  It is speculated that OsSAP6 responds to soda salinity stress and interacts with OsPK5 to positively regulate soda saline-alkaline tolerance through ROS homeostasis
    + __OsPK5__, __OsSAP6__, [OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSAP6 Positively Regulates Soda Saline-Alkaline Stress Tolerance in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  This study revealed the features of OsSAP6 involved in response to soda saline-alkaline stress and the interaction with OsPK5, which provided resources for breeding aimed at improving the soda saline-alkaline stress tolerance of rice
