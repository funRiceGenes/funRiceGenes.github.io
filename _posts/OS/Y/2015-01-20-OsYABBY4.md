* **Key message**  
    + Beta-glucuronidase reporter assay and in situ analysis consistently revealed that OsYABBY4 was expressed in the meristems and developing vascular tissue of rice, predominantly in the phloem tissue, suggesting that the function of the rice gene is different from those of its counterparts in eudicots
    + These data together suggest that OsYABBY4 serves as a DNA-binding intermediate protein for SLR1 and is associated with the GA signaling pathway regulating gene expression during plant growth and development
    + We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice)
