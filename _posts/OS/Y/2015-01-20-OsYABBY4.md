## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [A rice YABBY gene, OsYABBY4, preferentially expresses in developing vascular tissue](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice YABBY gene, OsYABBY4, preferentially expresses in developing vascular tissue%5BTitle%5D)),  Beta-glucuronidase reporter assay and in situ analysis consistently revealed that OsYABBY4 was expressed in the meristems and developing vascular tissue of rice, predominantly in the phloem tissue, suggesting that the function of the rice gene is different from those of its counterparts in eudicots
