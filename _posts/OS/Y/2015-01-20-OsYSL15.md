* **Key message**  
    + These results strongly suggest that OsYSL15 is the dominant iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter responsible for iron uptake from the rhizosphere and is also responsible for phloem transport of iron
    + Rice OsYSL15 is an iron-regulated iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter expressed in the roots and is essential for iron uptake in early growth of the seedlings
    + Expression of OsYSL15 in root epidermis and stele was induced by iron deficiency and showed daily fluctuation
    + OsYSL15 restored a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when supplied with iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid and transported iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid in Xenopus laevis oocytes
    + OsYSL15 promoter-beta-glucuronidase analysis revealed that OsYSL15 expression in roots was dominant in the epidermis/exodermis and phloem cells under conditions of iron deficiency and was detected only in phloem under iron sufficiency
    + OsYSL15 knockdown seedlings showed severe arrest in germination and early growth and were rescued by high iron supply
    + These results demonstrate that rice OsYSL15 plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis during the early stages of growth
    + Two insertional osysl15 mutants exhibited chlorotic phenotypes under Fe deficiency and had reduced Fe concentrations in their shoots, roots, and seeds
    + Overexpression of OsYSL15 increased the Fe concentration in leaves and seeds from transgenic plants
    + OsYSL15 was also expressed in flowers, developing seeds, and in the embryonic scutellar epithelial cells during seed germination
    + RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1
    + The OsYSL15 promoter fusion to beta-glucuronidase showed that it was expressed in all root tissues when Fe was limited
    + We have characterized OsYSL15, one of the rice (Oryza sativa) YS1-like (YSL) genes that are strongly induced by iron (Fe) deficiency
    + Disruption of OsYSL15 leads to iron inefficiency in rice plants
