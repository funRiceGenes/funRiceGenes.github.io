## Expression information

## Key message
1. __manganese__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese Mn condition
2. __manganese__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice
3. __transporter__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results suggest that OsYSL6 is a Mn-nicotianamine transporter that is required for the detoxification of excess Mn in rice
4. __shoot__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese Mn condition
5. __shoot__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals
6. __shoot__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots
7. __growth__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese Mn condition
8. __root__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese Mn condition
9. __root__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals
10. __root__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots
