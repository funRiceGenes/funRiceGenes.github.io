* **Key message**  
    + This stabilizes OsYUCCA3 mRNA and promotes local auxin biosynthesis in anthers during male meiosis, which is essential for meiotic division and subsequent pollen development in rice
    + Our findings reveal that OsFAP1-dependent m(6)A deposition on OsYUCCA3 by OsFIP37 constitutes a hitherto unknown link between RNA modification and hormonal control of male meiosis in plant reproductive development
