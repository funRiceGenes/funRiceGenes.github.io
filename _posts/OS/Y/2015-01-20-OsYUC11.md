* **Key message**  
    + In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development
    + The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
    + All three genes were expressed in endosperm; expression of OsYUC11 appeared to be confined to endosperm tissue
    + Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of OsNF-YB1 and OsYUC11 during grain filling stage
    + OsNF-YB1, which acts as a key downstream effector of RGB1, interacts directly with the promoter of OsYUC11 and stimulates the OsYUC11 expression, thereby regulating auxin biosynthesis and starch accumulation and grain size
    + A rice transcription factor (TF) yeast library was screened, and 41 TFs that potentially bind to the OsYUC11 promoter were identified, of which OsNF-YB1, a member of the nuclear factor Y family, is predominantly expressed in the endosperm
    + Here, we described rice YUCCA (YUC) flavin-containing monooxygenase encoding gene OsYUC11 as a key contributor to auxin biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm
    + Both osyuc11 and osnf-yb1 mutants exhibited reduced seed size and increased chalkiness, accompanied by a reduction in indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis
    + We also found that OsYUC11 was a dynamically imprinted gene that predominantly expressed the paternal allele in the endosperm up to 10 d after fertilization (DAF) but then became a non-imprinted gene at 15 DAF
    + Interestingly, under LL, the expression of OsYUC11 was significantly downregulated, which subsequently resulted in reduced IAA in the developing rice spikelets, followed by poor activation of grain-filling enzymes
