* **Key message**  
    + Here, we reported that OsYAF9 and OsSWC4, two subunits of SWR1 and NuA4 complexes, are involved in rice vegetative and reproductive development
    + Loss of OsYAF9 resulted in reduced height, fewer tillers, fewer pollen grains, and defects in embryogenesis and seed filling
    + The reduced height caused by OsYAF9 mutation and OsSWC4 knockdown was due to shorter internodes and defects in cell elongation, and this phenotype was rescued with gibberellin (GA) treatment, suggesting that both OsYAF9 and OsSWC4 are involved in the GA biosynthesis pathway
    + Z deposition and H4 acetylation at the GA biosynthesis genes with OsYAF9
    + Chromatin remodeling factors OsYAF9 and OsSWC4 interact to promote internode elongation in rice.
    + Together, our study provides insights into the mechanisms involving OsSWC4 and OsYAF9 forming a protein complex to promote rice internode elongation with H2A
