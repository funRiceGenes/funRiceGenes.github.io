## Key message
1. __defense__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D),  The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants
2. __defense response__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D),  The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants

## Connection
1. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D),  Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1)

5. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).%5BTitle%5D),  We have previously reported that a member of this group, OsGAP1, is able to alleviate salt stress and stimulate defense responses, and bind to both phospholipids and an unconventional G-protein, OsYchF1
6. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).%5BTitle%5D),  On the other hand, the ability to alleviate salt stress by OsGAP1 is dependent only on its ability to bind OsYchF1 and is independent of its phospholipid-binding activity
