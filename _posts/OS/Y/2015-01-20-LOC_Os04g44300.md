* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsYSL13 was highly expressed in leaves, especially in leaf blades, whereas its expression was induced by Fe deficiency both in roots and shoots
    + Metal measurement revealed that Fe concentrations were lower in the youngest leaf and higher in the older leaves of the osysl13 mutant under both Fe sufficiency and deficiency conditions, compared with the wild type and two complementation lines
    + OsYSL13 was located in the plasma membrane
    + OsYSL13 Is Involved in Iron Distribution in Rice.
