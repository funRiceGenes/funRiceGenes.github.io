* **Key message**  
    + To address the problem of iron-deficiency anemia, one of the most prevalent human micronutrient deficiencies globally, iron-biofortified rice was produced using three transgenic approaches: by enhancing iron storage in grains via expression of the iron storage protein ferritin using endosperm-specific promoters, enhancing iron translocation through overproduction of the natural metal chelator nicotianamine, and enhancing iron flux into the endosperm by means of iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2 expression under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and sucrose transporter promoter
    + These results suggest that OsYSL2 is a rice metal-NA transporter that is responsible for the phloem transport of iron and manganese, including the translocation of iron and manganese into the grain
    + OsYSL2 is a rice metal-nicotianamine transporter that is regulated by iron and expressed in the phloem
    + We previously isolated OsYSL2, a functional iron [Fe(II)]- and manganese [Mn(II)]-nicotianamine complex transporter that is expressed in phloem cells and developing seeds
    + Furthermore, when OsYSL2 expression was driven by the sucrose transporter promoter, the Fe concentration in the polished rice was up to 4
    + These results indicate that the altered expression of OsYSL2 changes the localization of Fe, and that OsYSL2 is a critical Fe-nicotianamine transporter important for Fe translocation, especially in the shoots and endosperm
    + Rice metal-nicotianamine transporter, OsYSL2, is required for the long-distance transport of iron and manganese
    + Of particular interest was OsYSL2, the transcripts of which were not detected in the roots of either iron-sufficient or iron-deficient plants, but dramatic expression was induced in the leaves by iron deficiency
    + Promoter:beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that OsYSL2 was expressed in companion cells in iron-sufficient roots
    + Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes
    + At the vegetative stage in an OsYSL2i line, the Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the shoots, and the Fe concentration was increased in the roots
    + The Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the seeds of OsYSL2i, especially in the endosperm
    + Moreover, the Fe concentration in OXOsYSL2 was lower in the seeds and shoots, but higher in the roots, compared with the wild type
    + Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that OsYSL2 transported iron(II)-nicotianamine (NA) and manganese(II)-NA, but did not transport iron(III)-phyosiderophore
    + At the reproductive stage, positron-emitting tracer imaging system analysis revealed that Fe translocation to the shoots and seeds was suppressed in OsYSL2i
    + Strong OsYSL2 promoter activity was also detected in developing seeds
    + In iron-deficient leaves, the OsYSL2 promoter was active in all tissues with particularly strong GUS activity evident in companion cells
    + The phloem-specific expression of the OsYSL2 promoter suggests that OsYSL2 is involved in the phloem transport of iron
    + CF1 is allelic to the metal transporter OsYSL2, which transports Fe from the roots to the shoots
    + Further analysis showed that high expression levels of CF1 improve Fe nutrition in the shoots, subsequently inhibiting Cd uptake by systemically inhibiting expression of the main Cd uptake gene OsNramp5 in the roots
    + Compared with the CF1 allele from &#x27;02428&#x27; (CF1(02428) ), higher expression levels of CF1 from &#x27;TQ&#x27; (CF1(TQ) ) increased the Fe contents and decreased Cd levels in rice grains
