* **Publication**  
    + [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D), 2007, J Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AP002842](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AP002842)

* **Key message**  
    + It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
    + The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds
    + Only OsACX1 was upregulated by wounding, both locally and systemically
