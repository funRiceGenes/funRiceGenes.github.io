## Expression information

## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
3. __seed__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds
4. __seed__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
5. __stem__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds
6. __stem__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  Only OsACX1 was upregulated by wounding, both locally and systemically
7. __root__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds

## Connection
1. __OsACX1__, __OsACX3__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively
2. __OsACX1__, __OsACX2__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively
3. __OsACX1__, __OsACX2__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
