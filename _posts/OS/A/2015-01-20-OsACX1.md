* **Key message**  
    + It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
    + The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds
    + Only OsACX1 was upregulated by wounding, both locally and systemically
