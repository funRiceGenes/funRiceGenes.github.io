* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, we conclude that OsALD1 plays a role in disease resistance response of rice against the infection with rice blast fungus
    + OsALD1 proteins predominantly localized at the chloroplast in the plant cells
    + OsALD1 mRNA was strongly transcribed in the infected leaves of rice plants by Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus
    + GM rice plants over-expressing OsALD1 were resistant to the fungal infection

    + __OsAGD2__, __OsALD1__, [Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases%5BTitle%5D), AGD2 and its close homolog ALD1 (for AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1) encode aminotransferases that act on an overlapping set of amino acids in vitro
    + __OsAGD2__, __OsALD1__, [Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases%5BTitle%5D), However, kinetic parameters indicate that AGD2 and ALD1 may drive the aminotransferase reaction in opposite directions
    + __OsAGD2__, __OsALD1__, [Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases%5BTitle%5D), ALD1-deficient mutants have the opposite phenotypes from agd2-1, showing reduced SA production and increased disease susceptibility
    + __OsAGD2__, __OsALD1__, [Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases%5BTitle%5D), Furthermore, ALD1 transcript levels are elevated in agd2-1 and are induced in the wild type by bacterial pathogen infection
    + __OsAGD2__, __OsALD1__, [Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases%5BTitle%5D), ALD1 is responsible for some of the elevated SA content and a majority of the disease resistance and dwarfism of agd2-1
    + __OsAGD2__, __OsALD1__, [Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases%5BTitle%5D), We suggest that AGD2 synthesizes an important amino acid-derived molecule that promotes development and suppresses defenses, whereas ALD1 generates a related amino acid-derived molecule important for activating defense signaling
