* **Key message**  
    + DS1/OsEMF1 interacts with OsARF11 to control rice architecture by regulation of brassinosteroid signaling.
    + Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV
