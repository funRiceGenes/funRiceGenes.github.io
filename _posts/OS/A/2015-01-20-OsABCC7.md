* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants expressing OsABCC7 Promoter-GUS (¦Â-glucuronidase) suggest that the gene was predominantly expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells in the stele region of the primary and lateral roots
    + Knockout of OsABCC7 in rice significantly decreased As concentration in the xylem sap and As concentration in the shoots, but had little effect on root As concentration
