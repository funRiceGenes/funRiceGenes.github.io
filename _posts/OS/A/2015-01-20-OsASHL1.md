* **Key message**  
    + Lower expression of Ehd1, OsVIL4, and OsMADS51 in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant background accompanies a delayed vegetative growth phase and photoperiod-sensitive phase compared with that in wild type
    + In addition, the expression of key genes in brassinosteroid and gibberellic acid metabolism is altered in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that the COMPASS-like complex regulates plant growth and development by modulating the levels of these two phytohormones
    + OsASHL1 and OsASHL2, two members of the COMPASS-like complex, control floral transition and plant development in rice.
    + In summary, we demonstrate that OsASHL1 and OsASHL2 are important for floral transition and plant development
    + The osashl1 osashl2 double mutant shows a dwarf and late-flowering phenotype
