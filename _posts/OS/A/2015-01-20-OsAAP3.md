    + However, RNAi of OsAAP3 decreased significantly Arg, Lys, Asp, and Thr concentrations to a small extent, and thus promoted bud outgrowth, increased significantly tiller numbers and effective panicle numbers per plant, and further enhanced significantly grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE)
    + Elevated expression of OsAAP3 in transgenic plants resulted in significantly higher amino acid concentrations of Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Ala, Gln, Gly, Thr and Tyr, and inhibited bud outgrowth and rice tillering
    + Blocking Amino acid transporter OsAAP3 improves grain yield by promoting outgrowth buds and increasing tiller number in rice.
    + In this study, we demonstrated that inhibiting expression of the rice amino acid transporter OsAAP3 increased grain yield due to a formation of larger numbers of tillers as a result of increased bud outgrowth
    + We generated knockout-lines of OsAAP3 on Japonica ZH11 and KY131 using CRISPR technology and found that grain yield could be increased significantly
    + These results suggest that manipulation of OsAAP3 expression could be used to increase grain yield in rice
