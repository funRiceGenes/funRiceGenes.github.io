* **Key message**  
    + Together, this study provides new insights into the roles of ethylene in Pi-deficiency response in rice seedlings and the isoform-specific function of OsACS genes in this process
    + Interestingly, in contrast to the known inhibitory role of ethylene on root elongation, both OsACS mutants, especially OsACS1, almost fail to promote lateral root growth in response to Pi-deficiency, demonstrating a stimulatory role of ethylene in lateral root development under Pi-deficient condition
