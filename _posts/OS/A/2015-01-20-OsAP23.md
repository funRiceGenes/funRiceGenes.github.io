* **Key message**  
    + In this study, the rice OsAP23 gene, which encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor, was isolated from rice using a yeast-one-hybrid system
    + The OsAP23 transcription factor belongs to the B3 group of the ERF subfamily
    + Germination results for transgenic Arabidopsis plants hosting the OsAP23 gene revealed greater inhibition at the germination and seedling stages with increasing concentration of NaCl compared to the wild-type plants
    + In addition, following exposure to high salt concentrations, several stress-responsive regulatory genes were induced to a significantly greater extent in the wild-type lines compared with lines that over-express OsAP23
    + These results suggested that OsAP23 might be a negative regulator of the salt stress response in higher plants
    + Exogenous ABA also reduced the rate of germination of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds that over-express OsAP23 compared with wild-type Arabidopsis seeds
