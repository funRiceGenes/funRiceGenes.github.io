* **Key message**  
    + The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress
    + Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling
    + To determine whether antioxidant capacity affects the ability of rice plants to withstand chilling at the booting stage, we produced transgenic rice plants that overexpress OsAPXa and have increased APX activity
    + Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa
    + APXa mRNA levels increased within 1 h after seedlings were exposed to 42 °C
    + Heat shock induction of the APXa gene could be a possible cause of reduced chilling injury in rice seedlings
    + The cytosolic APX gene expression in response to high and low temperature was analysed with an APXa gene probe
