* **Key message**  
    + The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress
    + Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling
    + To determine whether antioxidant capacity affects the ability of rice plants to withstand chilling at the booting stage, we produced transgenic rice plants that overexpress OsAPXa and have increased APX activity
    + Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa
    + APXa mRNA levels increased within 1 h after seedlings were exposed to 42 °C
    + Heat shock induction of the APXa gene could be a possible cause of reduced chilling injury in rice seedlings
    + The cytosolic APX gene expression in response to high and low temperature was analysed with an APXa gene probe
    + The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein OsLEA5 interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.
    + Here, by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq, we found that ZFP36, a rice zinc finger transcription factor, could directly bind to the promoter of OsAPX1, coding an ascorbate peroxidase (APX) which has the most affinity for H2O2 (substrate; a type of ROS), and act as a transcriptional activator of OsAPX1 promoter
    + Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and OsLEA5 could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1
    + OsAPX1 also affects salicylic acid (SA) synthesis and signaling, which contribute to blast resistance
    + OsAPX1 Positively Contributes to Rice Blast Resistance.
    + In conclusion, we show that OsAPX1 is a key factor that connects the upstream gene silencing and transcription regulatory routes with the downstream phytohormone and redox pathway, which provides an insight into the sophisticated regulatory network of rice innate immunity
    + Here, we report that OsAPX1 also promotes ROS production such that a delicate cellular ROS homeostasis is achieved temporally after Magnaporthe oryzae infection
