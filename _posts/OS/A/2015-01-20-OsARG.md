* **Key message**  
    + The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases
    + OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
    + The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by a wild type OsARG transgene
    + Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen
    + OsARG, ubiquitously expressed in various organs, was more strongly expressed in the developing panicles
    + The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the OsARG gene
    + Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.
    + The unique rice arginase gene OsARG is known to affect nitrogen use efficiency and is also associated with higher yields in rice
