* **Key message**  
    + The results imply that OsAPX4 gene has an important role in leaf senescence pathway mediated by ROS signaling
    + Silencing of OsAPX4 and OsAPX3 expression in RNAiOsAPX4 did not affect the growth of plants under growth chamber conditions, but aging transgenic plants interestingly displayed an early senescence phenotype
