## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: OsAUX1 expression in root hair cells is different from its paralogous gene, AtAUX1, expressed in non-hair cells |  Decreased auxin distribution and contents in osaux1 mutant result in reduction of OsCyCB1;1 expression and shortened PR, LR and RH under Cd stress, but can be rescued by the membrane-permeable auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA)  
__OverExpression__:
