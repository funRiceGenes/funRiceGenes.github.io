## Expression information

## Key message
1. __starch__, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, ABA alone did not affect the gene expression of OsAPL3 and starch content
2. __starch__, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D),  Collectively, these results indicated that the expression level of OsAPL3 and starch content in the cultured cells were cooperatively controlled by alterations in the concentration of both sucrose and ABA
3. __seed development__, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D),  OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
4. __ ABA __, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, ABA alone did not affect the gene expression of OsAPL3 and starch content
5. __seed__, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D),  OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
