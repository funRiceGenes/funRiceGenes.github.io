* **Key message**  
    + In addition, AHL1 is located on the surface of chromosomes during mitosis
    + Functional studies revealed that OsAHL1 regulates root development under drought condition to enhance drought avoidance, participates in oxidative stress response and also regulates the content of chlorophyll in rice leaves
    + The results indicated OsAHL1 has both drought avoidance and drought tolerance that could greatly improve drought resistance of the rice plant
    + Overexpression of OsAHL1 enhanced multiple stress tolerances in rice plants during both seedling and panicle development stages
    + A novel gene OsAHL1 improves both drought avoidance and drought tolerance in rice.
    + OsAHL1 specifically binds to the A/T rich sequence region of promoters or introns, and hence directly regulates the expression of many stress related downstream genes
