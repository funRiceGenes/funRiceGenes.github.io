* **Key message**  
    + In addition, overexpression OsANN3 showed better growth under drought stress comparing to wild type, such as longer root length and more stomata closure for reducing water loss by regulating ABA-dependent stress response pathways
    + Overexpression of OsANN3 in rice significantly increased survival rates under drought stress, while knocking down OsANN3 resulted in sensitivity to drought
    + Together with its Ca2+ and phospholipid binding activity, we proposed that when plants were subjected to drought stress, OsANN3 might mediate Ca2+ influx by binding to phospholipid to activate ABA signaling pathways
    + We found that expression of OsANN3 was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments
    + Meanwhile, OsANN3 overexpression showed enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA
