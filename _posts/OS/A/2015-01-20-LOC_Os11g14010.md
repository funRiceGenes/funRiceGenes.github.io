* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + 1 and Hap7 of OsAL11 were favorable haplotypes of seed weight and germination under osmotic stress
    + 1 and OsAL11 in rice weakened the tolerance to drought in the adult stage
    + 1 and osal11 mutants have larger seeds and are more sensitive to abscisic acid and mannitol during germination stage
