* **Key message**  
    + Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination

* **Connection**  
    + __OsARF17__, __OsmiR167a__, [OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
    + __OsARF17__, __OsmiR167a__, [OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
