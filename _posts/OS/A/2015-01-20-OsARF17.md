* **Key message**  
    + Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
    + Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.
    + This suggests that OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection
    + OsARF17 also confers resistance to a cytorhabdovirus and was directly targeted by one of the viral proteins
    + We show here that two fijiviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses) utilize their proteins to disturb the dimerization of OsARF17 and repress its transcriptional activation ability, while a tenuivirus (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) directly interferes with the DNA binding activity of OsARF17

* **Connection**  
    + __OsARF17__, __OsmiR167a__, [OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
    + __OsARF17__, __OsmiR167a__, [OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
