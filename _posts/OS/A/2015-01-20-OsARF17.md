    + Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
    + Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.
    + This suggests that OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection
    + OsARF17 also confers resistance to a cytorhabdovirus and was directly targeted by one of the viral proteins
    + We show here that two fijiviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses) utilize their proteins to disturb the dimerization of OsARF17 and repress its transcriptional activation ability, while a tenuivirus (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) directly interferes with the DNA binding activity of OsARF17
    + miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice
    + RT-qPCR assays showed that the induction of plant defense-related genes, such as WRKY transcription factors, OsAHT2 and OsDR8, and JA-related genes, were significantly suppressed in OsARF17 mutants in response to RSMV
    + Our previous studies have indicated that auxin response factor OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against diverse rice viruses
    + METHODS: Utilizing a comparative transcriptome analysis of Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV)-inoculated OsARF17 mutant rice plants, to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of OsARF17 in antiviral defense pathway
    + RESULTS: KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonged to plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were markedly enriched in OsARF17 mutants under RSMV inoculation
