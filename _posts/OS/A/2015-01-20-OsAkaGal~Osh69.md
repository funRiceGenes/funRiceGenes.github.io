## Key message
1. __leaf__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
2. __leaf__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
3. __chloroplast__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
4. __salicylic acid__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
5. __jasmonic__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
6. __jasmonic acid__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
7. __senescence__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
8. __senescence__, [A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
