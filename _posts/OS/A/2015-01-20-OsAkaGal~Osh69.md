* **Key message**  
    + The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding)
    + These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence
