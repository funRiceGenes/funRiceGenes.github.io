__RAPdb__: [Os03g0810800](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os03g0810800)  

## Publication
1. [Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, J Plant Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration |  Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
