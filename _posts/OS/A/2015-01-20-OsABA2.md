    + Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose
    + Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration
    + These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis
    + Map-based cloning identified a G-to-A point mutation resulting in a D-to-N substitution at the amino acid position 110 of OsABA2 (LOC_Os03g59610) in lmm9150
    + Consistent with the function of OsABA2 in ABA biosynthesis, ABA level in the lmm9150 mutant was significantly reduced
    + We also found that OsABA2 has feedback regulation on OsMPK1 kinase activity
    + Finally, genetic analysis showed that OsABA2 can enhance the sensitivity of rice to ABA and the tolerance of rice to drought and salt stress
    + Further research reveals that OsMPK1 and OsABA2 coordinately regulate the biosynthesis of ABA, and phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 plays a crucial role in regulating the biosynthesis of ABA
    + Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.
    + Here, by using yeast two-hybrid assay and firefly luciferase complementary imaging assay, we show that OsMPK1 physically interact with a short-chain dehydrogenase protein OsABA2
