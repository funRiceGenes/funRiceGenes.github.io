* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose
    + Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration
    + These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis
