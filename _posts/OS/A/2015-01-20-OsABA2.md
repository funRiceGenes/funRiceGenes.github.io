* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose
    + Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration
    + These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis
    + Map-based cloning identified a G-to-A point mutation resulting in a D-to-N substitution at the amino acid position 110 of OsABA2 (LOC_Os03g59610) in lmm9150
    + Consistent with the function of OsABA2 in ABA biosynthesis, ABA level in the lmm9150 mutant was significantly reduced

* **Connection**  
    + __OsABA2__, __OsbHLH035~OsbHLH35__, [The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.%5BTitle%5D),  In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated
