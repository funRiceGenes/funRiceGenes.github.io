* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report the significant role of OsABCG26 in regulating the development of anther cuticle and pollen exine together with OsABCG15 in rice
    + osabcg26 osabcg15 double mutant displays an almost complete absence of anther cuticle and pollen exine, similar to that of osabcg15 single mutant
    + Taken together, we propose that OsABCG26 and OsABCG15 collaboratively regulate rice male reproduction: OsABCG26 is mainly responsible for the transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells to anther wall layers, while OsABCG15 mainly is responsible for the export of lipidic molecules from the tapetal cells to anther locules for pollen exine development
    + Cytological and chemical analysis indicate that osabcg26 shows reduced transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells for anther cuticle development
    + Supportively, the localization of OsABCG26 is on the plasma membrane of the anther wall layers
    + Additionally, wild-type pollen tubes showed a growth defect in osabcg26 pistils, leading to low seed setting in osabcg26 cross-pollinated with the wild-type pollen
    + Cytological analysis revealed defects in tapetal cells, lipidic Ubisch bodies, pollen exine, and anther cuticle in the osabcg26 mutant
    + These results indicated that OsABCG26 plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice
    + OsABCG26 was specifically expressed in the anther and pistil
    + Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport
    + Here, we characterized a rice male sterile mutant osabcg26
