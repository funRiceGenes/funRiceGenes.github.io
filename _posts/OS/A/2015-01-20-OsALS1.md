## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsALS1 encodes a half-size ABC transporter that is a member of the TAP transporter associated with antigen processing sub-group
2. __transcription factor__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we functionally characterized a rice gene, Os03g0755100 OsALS1), that is regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor
3. __root__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsALS1 was rapidly and specifically induced by Al in the roots, but not by other metals or low pH
4. __root__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsALS1 was localized at all cells of the roots
5. __root__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Comparison of Al accumulation patterns between wild-type and osals1 mutants showed that there was no difference in Al levels in the cell sap of root tips between wild-type and the mutants, but the mutants accumulated more Al in the cytosol and nucleus than the wild-type
