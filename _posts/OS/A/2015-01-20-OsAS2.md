    + [D83378](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/D83378)

* **Key message**  
    + Genetic and molecular data using mutants and transgenic plants have provided insights into the light perception by the photoreceptors, carbon and nitrogen sensing and signal transduction mechanism in the asn regulation
    + Global analysis of carbon and nitrogen metabolites supports the impact of asn regulation in the synthesis and transport of asparagine in plants
    + Conversely, OsAS2 mRNA was abundant in leaf blades and sheathes of rice
