* **Key message**  
    + OsBAT1 transcript levels are enhanced in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress including salt stress and abscisic acid
    + This study demonstrates several unique characteristics of OsBAT1 especially its ability to unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes; bipolar translocation and its transcript upregulation under abiotic stresses indicate that it is a multifunctional protein
    + Overall, this study represents significant contribution in advancing our knowledge regarding functions of OsBAT1 in RNA and DNA metabolism and its putative role in abiotic stress signaling in plants
    + Interestingly OsBAT1 also exhibits unique DNA helicase activity, which has not been reported so far in any BAT1 homologue
    + The K m value for OsBAT1 DNA helicase is 0
