* **Key message**  
    + The function of OsACBP6 was investigated by overexpressing 35S::OsACBP6 in the peroxisomal abc transporter1 (pxa1) mutant defective in peroxisomal fatty acid Î²-oxidation
    + The osacbp6 mutant showed diminished growth with reduction in root meristem activity and leaf growth
    + Disruption of OsACBP6 compromises growth and led to provoked defense response, suggesting a correlation of enhanced acyl-CoAs content with defense responses
    + Taken together, loss of OsACBP6 not only resulted in a disruption of the acyl-CoA homeostasis but also peroxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis
    + In contrast, osacbp6-complemented transgenic rice displayed similar phenotype to the wild type rice, supporting a role for OsACBP6 in the maintenance of the acyl-CoA pool and ROS homeostasis
    + Furthermore, quantification of plant hormones supported the findings observed in the transcriptome and an increase in jasmonic acid level occurred in osacbp6
