* **Key message**  
    + OsAPL controls the nutrient transport systems in the leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + OsAPL positively controls the seedling growth and grain size in rice by targeting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase-encoding gene, OsRHA1, as well as drastically affects genes encoding H(+)-coupled secondary active transporters
    + Overexpression of OsAPL leads to a 10% increase in grain yield at the heading stage
    + Taken together, our findings suggest the involvement of OsAPL in nutrients transport and crop yield accumulation in rice
    + Decreased expression of OsAPL leads to a decreased expression level of nutrient transporter genes
    + OsAPL acts as a transcriptional activator of OsRHA1, which encodes a subunit of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (primary transporter)
