* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis with OsAGAP constitutively expression showed reduced apical dominance, shorter primary roots, increasing number of longer adventitious roots
    + Here, we show that over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GTPase-activating protein (ARF-GAP) in rice, impaired PAT and interfered with both primary and lateral root development
    + Together, our data suggest that OsAGAP has a specific role in regulating vesicle trafficking pathways such as the auxin influx pathway, which in turn controls auxin-dependent root growth in plants
    + Over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP, interferes with auxin influx, vesicle trafficking and root development
    + Determination of whole-plant IAA level showed that there is a sharp increase of free IAA in OsAGAP transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings
    + These results suggest OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP of rice, maybe involved in the mediation of plant root development by regulating auxin level
    + OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP from rice, regulates root development mediated by auxin in Arabidopsis
    + Thus, we propose that AUX1 accumulation in the OsAGAP overexpression and actin disrupted cells may be due to the fact that endocytosis of the auxin influx carrier AUX1 early endosome was greatly promoted by actin cytoskeleton disruption
    + OsPDCD5 interacted directly with OsAGAP, and OsAGAP positively regulated plant architecture and grain yield in rice
