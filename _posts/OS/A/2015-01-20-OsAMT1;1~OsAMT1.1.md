* **Key message**  
    + The NH4(+) uptake of roots is mainly governed by membrane transporters, with OsAMT1;1 being a prominent member of the OsAMT1 gene family that is known to be involved in NH4(+) transport in rice plants
    + A transgenic approach was undertaken to investigate the role of a rice ammonium transporter (OsAMT1-1) in ammonium uptake and consequent ammonium assimilation under different nitrogen regimes
    + OsAMT1;1 also enhanced overall plant growth, especially under suboptimal NH4(+) levels
    + These results suggest that OsAMT1;1 has the potential for improving nitrogen use efficiency, plant growth, and grain yield under both suboptimal and optimal nitrogen fertilizer conditions
    + Gene expression analysis of members of ammonium transporter gene family in flag leaves during active grain filling stage revealed that all the three members of OsAMT3 family genes (OsAMT1;1-3), only one member of OsAMT2 family i
    + To study the regulation of ammonium uptake into rice roots, three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1, 1;2 and 1;3; Oryza sativa ammonium transporter) were isolated and examined
    + Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3
    + In both the genotypes, both increase and decline in seed protein contents matched with the expressions levels of OsAMT1;1, OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2 in the flag leaves during grain filling stage indicating that high nitrogen nutrition in KN3119 probably causes the repression of these genes which might be important during grain filling
    + CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice
    + OsAMT1;1 is a high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + rufipogon on either side of the promoter of OsAMT1;1, demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter
    + The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al
    + This study shows that OsAMT1;1 is a constitutively expressed, nitrogen-responsive gene, and its protein product is localized in the plasma membrane
    + , OsAMT2;3 and the high affinity OsAMT1;1 were differentially expressed and were affected by different doses of nitrogen
    + Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice
    + Transgenic rice lines (L-2 and L-3) overexpressing the OsAMT1;1 gene had the same root structure as the wild type (WT)
    + Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels
    + The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium
    + Over-expression of the rice OsAMT1-1 gene increases ammonium uptake and content, but impairs growth and development of plants under high ammonium nutrition
    + Inhibition of yeast growth or currents elicited from oocytes by ammonium assimilation inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine indicates that NH4 (+) transport by OsAMT1;1 is likely feedback regulated by accumulation of the substrate
    + Our results show that OsAMT1;1 is a NH4 (+) transporter with relatively lower affinity to NH4 (+) (110-129 μM in oocytes and yeast cells, respectively)
    + In addition, effects of phosphorylation inhibitors imply that NH4 (+) uptake by OsAMT1;1 is also modulated by tyrosine-specific protein kinase or calcium-regulated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase involved phosphorylation processes
    + The OsAMT1.1 gene functions in ammonium uptake and ammonium-potassium homeostasis over low and high ammonium concentration ranges.
