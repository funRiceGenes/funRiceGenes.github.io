* **Key message**  
    + Functional characterization of OsANTH3 using T-DNA insertional knockout and gene-edited mutants revealed that a mutation in OsANTH3 decreased seed fertility by reducing the pollen germination percentage in rice
    + Global Identification of ANTH Genes Involved in Rice Pollen Germination and Functional Characterization of a Key Member, OsANTH3
    + Of them, OsANTH3 represented the highest expression in mature pollen
