* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsAAP15 in the field significantly increased primary and secondary branches, filled grain number, and grain yield by regulating the concentrations of amino acids Tyr and Val in the panicle
    + Altered expression of key N-response amino acid transporter gene OsAAP15 positively regulated panicle branching at low N concentrations, however, OsAAP15 negatively influenced it at high N concentrations
