    + __OsA2__, __OSA7~osAHA7~AHA7__, [Isoforms of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isoforms of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.%5BTitle%5D),  Resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª resulted in induction of the following PM H+-ATPase isoforms, OsA1, OsA2, OsA5 and OsA7 in the shoots and OsA2, OsA5, OsA7 and OsA8 in the roots
    + __OsA2__, __OSA7~osAHA7~AHA7__, [Isoforms of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isoforms of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.%5BTitle%5D),  PM H+-ATPase isoforms OsA2 and OsA7 displayed the strongest induction in response to N resupply, therefore indicating that these genes could be involved in N uptake in rice

    + __OSA7~osAHA7~AHA7__, __OsA8__, [Isoforms of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isoforms of plasma membrane H+-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª or NH‚Ç<U+383C><U+3E34>+.%5BTitle%5D),  Resupply of NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª resulted in induction of the following PM H+-ATPase isoforms, OsA1, OsA2, OsA5 and OsA7 in the shoots and OsA2, OsA5, OsA7 and OsA8 in the roots
