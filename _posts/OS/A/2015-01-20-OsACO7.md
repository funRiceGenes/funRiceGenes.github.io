## Expression information

## Key message
1. __blast__, [Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it

## Connection
1. __OsACO7__, __OsACS2__, [Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7
