* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that Cu treatment reduced the expression of OsABA8ox2, a key gene of ABA catabolism in rice seeds.

* **Connection**  
    + __OsABA8ox2~OsCYP707A6__, __OsABA8ox3__, [Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose
    + __OsABA8ox2~OsCYP707A6__, __OsWRKY53__, [OsWRKY53 Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsWRKY53 Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that OsWRKY53 directly bound to the promoters of OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2 to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the OsWRKY53-oe plants
