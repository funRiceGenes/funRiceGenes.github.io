* **Key message**  
    + In contrast, knocking out OsACE1 led to compromised growth fitness and intensified toxic symptoms under MTR/FSA stress and accumulation of more toxic MTR and FSA in rice
    + RESULTS: OsACE1 overexpression conferred rice resistance to toxicity of MTR/FSA compared to wild-type, manifested by improved plant elongation and biomass, attenuated cellular injury, and increased chlorophyll accumulation
