* **Key message**  
    + In conclusion, OsAGO17 might be a critical protein in the sRNA pathway and positively regulates grain size and weight in rice
    + Combined with the results of immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis, we suggested that OsAGO17 formed an RISC with OsmiR397b and affected rice development by suppression of LAC expression
