* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsANN4  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os05g31750](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g31750)

* **Publication**  
    + [OsANN4 modulates ROS production and mediates Ca 2+ influx in response to ABA ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsANN4 modulates ROS production and mediates Ca 2+ influx in response to ABA %5BTitle%5D), 2021, BMC Plant Biol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Under ABA treatment, the plants in which OsANN4 was knocked down by RNA interference showed some visible phenotypic changes compared to the wild type, such as a lower rooting rate and shorter shoot and root lengths
    + OsANN4 modulates ROS production and mediates Ca 2+ influx in response to ABA
    + Conclusions: OsANN4 plays a crucial role in the ABA response, partially by modulating ROS production, mediating Ca2+ influx or interacting with OsCDPK24
