* **Key message**  
    + OsALMT7 Maintains Panicle Size and Grain Yield in Rice by Mediating Malate Transport.
    + Consistent with a function for OsALMT7 as a malate transporter, the panicle of the paab1-1 mutant contained less malate than wild type, particularly at the apical portions, and injection of malate into the paab1-1 panicle could alleviate the spikelet degeneration phenotype
    + The rice malate permeable OsALMT7 influences panicle development and grain yield
    + A truncated OsALMT7 mutant, panicle apical abortion1 (paab1) lacking at least 2 transmembrane helices, mediates reduced malate efflux resulting in yield reducing
