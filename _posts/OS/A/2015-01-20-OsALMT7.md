    + OsALMT7 Maintains Panicle Size and Grain Yield in Rice by Mediating Malate Transport.
    + Consistent with a function for OsALMT7 as a malate transporter, the panicle of the paab1-1 mutant contained less malate than wild type, particularly at the apical portions, and injection of malate into the paab1-1 panicle could alleviate the spikelet degeneration phenotype
