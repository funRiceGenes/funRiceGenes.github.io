## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression of OsABA8ox3 was promptly induced by rehydration after PEG-mimic dehydration, a tendency opposite to the changes of ABA level |  We therefore constructed rice OsABA8ox3 silencing RNA interference, RNAi and overexpression plants |  However, OsABA8ox3 RNAi lines showed significant improvement in drought stress tolerance while the overexpression seedlings were hypersensitive to drought stress when compared with wild type in terms of plant survival rates after 10 days of unwatering  
__OverExpression__: We therefore constructed rice OsABA8ox3 silencing RNA interference, RNAi and overexpression plants |  However, OsABA8ox3 RNAi lines showed significant improvement in drought stress tolerance while the overexpression seedlings were hypersensitive to drought stress when compared with wild type in terms of plant survival rates after 10 days of unwatering  
__RNAi__: We therefore constructed rice OsABA8ox3 silencing RNA interference, RNAi and overexpression plants |  However, OsABA8ox3 RNAi lines showed significant improvement in drought stress tolerance while the overexpression seedlings were hypersensitive to drought stress when compared with wild type in terms of plant survival rates after 10 days of unwatering |  Enzyme activity analysis indicated that OsABA8ox3 RNAi plants had higher superoxide dismutase SOD and catalase CAT activities and less malondialdehyde MDA content than those of wild type when the plants were exposed to dehydration treatment, indicating a better anti-oxidative stress capability and less membrane damage |  LEA genes, were enhanced with higher transcript levels in OsABA8ox3 RNAi transgenic seedlings
