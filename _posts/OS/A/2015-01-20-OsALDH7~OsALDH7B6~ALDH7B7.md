* **Key message**  
    + These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly
    + Interestingly, endosperms from the osaldh7 null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage
    + Using diï¬€erential display RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, a full-length aldehyde dehydrogenase cDNA (ALDH7B7) was isolated from rice leaves infected by incompatible race of blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea
    + ALDH7B7 expression was induced by blast fungus infection, ultraviolet, mechanical wound in rice leaves and was not detected in untreated rice organs
    + The function of ALDH7B7 in the interaction process between blast fungus and rice is discussed
    + These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation
    + These data imply that OsALDH7 plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation
    + Here we reported a mutant with yellow-colored endosperm in rice, and showed that the yellow endosperm was caused by mutation of OsALDH7
    + Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice
    + We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in OsALDH7, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses
    + OsALDH7 is expressed in all tissues detected, with the highest level in mature seeds
