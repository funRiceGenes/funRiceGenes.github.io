* **Key message**  
    + The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter OsABCG3 is essential for pollen development in rice.
    + Here we identified two osabcg3 allelic mutants and demonstrated that OsABCG3 was required for pollen development in rice
    + The expression of some genes required for pollen wall formation was examined in osabcg3 mutants
    + Base on the genetic and cytological analyses, OsABCG3 was proposed to transport the tapetum-produced materials essential for pollen wall formation
    + OsABCG3 encodes a half-size ABCG transporter localized on the plasma membrane
    + Loss-function of OsABCG3 caused abnormal degradation of the tapetum
