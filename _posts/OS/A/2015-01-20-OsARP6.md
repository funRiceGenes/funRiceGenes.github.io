* **Key message**  
    + This was especially evident upon OsARP6 knockdown, which resulted in a number of genes linked to chloroplast function, that contained decreases in H2A
    + The osarp6 knockout mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including semi-dwarf phenotype, lower tillers number, short leaf length, changes in spikelet morphology, and seed abortion
    + Together, these results suggest that OsARP6 is involved in rice plant development, and H2A
    + OsARP6 interacted with OsPIE1, a central ATPase subunit of rice SWR1-C
    + The altered transcript level of genes involved in cell division suggested that OsARP6 affects cell cycle regulation
    + Microscopic thin sectioning of the top internode revealed that the dwarf phenotype of osarp6 was due to reduced number of cells rather than reduced cell length
