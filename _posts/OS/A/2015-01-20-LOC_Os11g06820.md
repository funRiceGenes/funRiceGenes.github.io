* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Natural variations of OsAUX5 occur in the cis elements of its promoter, which are differentially activated because of the different binding affinity between OsWRKY78 and the W-box, contributing to grain EAA variation among rice varieties
    + Natural variations of OsAUX5, a target gene of OsWRKY78, control the neutral essential amino acid content in rice grains
