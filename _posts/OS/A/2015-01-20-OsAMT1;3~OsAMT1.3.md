* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3
    + The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al
    + Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels
    + The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium
    + In this report, we demonstrate that the rice root expressed OsAMT1;3 (Oryza sativa ammonium transporter 1;3) functions as a typical high-affinity NH4(+) transporter and is weakly permeable to MeA(+) using growth assays in NH4(+) uptake defective yeast cells and electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes
    + Spatial expression analysis showed that the upregulated expression of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 and downregulated expression of OsAMT1;3 by ammonium were higher in the root mature region than in the root tips
