* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress
    + Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of OsABIL2 in regulating root development
    + Furthermore, OsABIL2 interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of OsABIL2, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling
    + However, unlike many other solely nucleus-localized clade A PP2Cs, the OsABIL2 is localized in both nucleus and cytosol
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing OsABIL2 (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter root hairs, suggesting that the effect of ABA on root hair elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP2C/SnRK2 ABA signaling module
    + A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that the interaction between OsABIL2 and a putative rice ABA receptor, OsPYL1, was ABA-dependent, and the interaction was lost with amino acid substitution from glycine to aspartic acid at the 183rd amino acid of the OsABIL2 protein, corresponding to abi1-1 mutation
    + The constitutive expression of OsABIL2 or OsABIL2G183D in Arabidopsis or rice decreased ABA sensitivity to differing degrees
    + These results indicated that the introduction of abi1-1 type dominant mutation was also effective in OsABIL2 at decreasing ABA sensitivity in plants, and the attenuation of ABA sensitivity could be an alternative parameter to improve rice performance under low temperatures
