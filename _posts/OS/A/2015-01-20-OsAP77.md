* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections
    + RT-PCR analysis showed that OsAP77 was induced not only by infection with these pathogens, but also after treatment with SA, INA, H2O2 or ABA
