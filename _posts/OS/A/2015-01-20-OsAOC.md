* **Key message**  
    + Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds
    + Further, the retardation in accumulation of ORSs and water were caused by jasmonic acid (JA) deficiency, resulting from down-regulation of OsAOC expression
