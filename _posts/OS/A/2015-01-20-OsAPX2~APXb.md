* **Key message**  
    + Loss of function in OsAPX2 affected the growth and development of rice seedlings, resulting in semi-dwarf seedlings, yellow-green leaves, leaf lesion mimic and seed sterility
    + Taken together, the cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX2 plays an important role in rice growth and development by protecting the seedlings from abiotic stresses through scavenging reactive oxygen species
    + Gene knockout study reveals that cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 2(OsAPX2) plays a critical role in growth and reproduction in rice under drought, salt and cold stresses
    + In this report, we studied the function of OsAPX2 gene using a T-DNA knockout mutant under the treatment of drought, salt and cold stresses
    + OsAPX2 expression was developmental- and spatial-regulated, and was induced by drought, salt, and cold stresses
    + Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling
    + Osapx2 mutants had lower APX activity and were sensitive to abiotic stresses; overexpression of OsAPX2 increased APX activity and enhanced stress tolerance
    + Loss of OsAPX2 altered rice architecture including shoot height and leaf inclination, resulting in shoot dwarfing, leaf dispersion and fertility decline
    + Additionally, the OsAPX2 conformational changes could be regulated by salt and heat stresses and these stimulated OsAPX2 dissociation and association, respectively
