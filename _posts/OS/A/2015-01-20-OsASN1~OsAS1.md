* **Key message**  
    + OsAS1 was mainly expressed in the roots with in situ hybridization showing that the corresponding mRNA was specifically accumulated in the three cell layers of root surface (epidermis, exodermis, and sclerenchyma) in an NH4 (+)-dependent manner
    + These results suggest that OsASN1 is involved in the regulation of rice development and is specific for tiller outgrowth
    + In addition, we show that overexpression (OX) of OsASN1 results in better nitrogen uptake and assimilation, and increased tolerance to N limitation at the seedling stage
    + Thus, OsASN1 can be an effective target gene for the development of rice cultivars with higher grain protein content, NUE, and grain yield under N-limiting conditions
    + OsASN1 Overexpression in Rice Increases Grain Protein Content and Yield under Nitrogen-Limiting Conditions
    + Under field conditions, the OsASN1 OX rice plants produced grains with increased N and protein contents without yield reduction compared to wild-type (WT) rice
