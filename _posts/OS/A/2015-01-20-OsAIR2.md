* **Key message**  
    + Heterogeneous overexpression of OsAIR2 in Arabidopsis improved the seed germination and increased the root length under arsenate stress conditions
    + Therefore, these results suggest that OsAIR2 may be associated with the plant response to As stress and acts as a positive regulator of arsenic stress tolerance
    + Expression of OsAIR2 was induced under various abiotic stress conditions, including heat, salt, drought, and As exposure
