## Expression information

## Key message
1. __phosphate__, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi)
2. __root__, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
3. __insect__, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
4. __ pi __, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients
5. __ pi __, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
