* **Key message**  
    + OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi)
    + OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
    + The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
    + The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients
    + Overexpression or mutation of OsACP1 affected Po degradation and utilization, which further influenced plant growth and productivity under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions
    + We concluded that OsACP1 is an active acid phosphatase that regulates rice growth under Pi stress conditions by recycling Pi from Po in the ER and GA
    + OsACP1 expression is specifically induced in almost all cell types of leaves and roots under Pi stress conditions
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsACP1 significantly affected intracellular Pi homeostasis and Pi starvation signalling
    + OsACP1 encodes an acid phosphatase with broad Po substrates and localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA)
    + Phylogenic analysis demonstrates that OsACP1 has a similar structure with human acid phosphatase PHOSPHO1
