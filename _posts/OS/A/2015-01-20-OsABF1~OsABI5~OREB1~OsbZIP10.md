* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, D-allose also up-regulated expression of OsABF1, encoding a conserved bZIP transcription factor in ABA signaling, in rice
    + The homozygous T-DNA insertional mutants Osabf1-1 and Osabf1-2 were more sensitive in response to drought and salinity treatments than wild type plants
    + Expression of the OsABI5 gene was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and high salinity, and down-regulated by drought and cold (4 degrees C) in seedlings
    + These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of D-allose at C6 by hexokinase is essential and OsABF1 is involved in the signal transduction for D-allose-induced growth inhibition
    + Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L
    + Complementation analysis revealed that the expression of OsABI5 driven by the 35S promoter could rescue ABA-insensitivity of abi5-1 during seed germination and result in hypersensitivity to ABA
    + Complementation tests and ABA (abscisic acid) hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis transgenic lines revealed the redundant function of OsABI5 splicing variants in ABA signaling
    + These results suggest that OsABI5 variants may have overlapping and distinct functions to fine tune gene expression in ABA signaling as transcription factors together with OsVP1
    + A bZIP-type transcription factor, OsABI5, undergoes alternative splicing
    + Characterization of alternative splicing products of bZIP transcription factors OsABI5
    + A bZIP transcription factor, OsABI5, was isolated from the panicle of Oryza sativa L
    + Over-expression of OsABI5 in rice conferred high sensitivity to salt stress
    + In our current study in rice, we have newly isolated and characterized the OsABF1 (Oryza sativa ABA responsive element binding factor 1) gene that encodes a bZIP transcription factor
    + The bZIP transcription factor OsABF1 is an ABA responsive element binding factor that enhances abiotic stress signaling in rice
    + In a yeast experiment, OsABF1 was shown to bind to ABA responsive elements (ABREs) and its N-terminal region was necessary to transactivate the downstream reporter gene
    + Furthermore, the upregulated expression of some ABA/stress-regulated genes in response to ABA treatment was suppressed in these Osabf1 mutants
    + Our current results thus suggest that OsABF1 is involved in abiotic stress responses and ABA signaling in rice
    + Repression of OsABI5 promoted stress tolerance and resulted in low fertility of rice
    + These results suggested that OsABI5 could regulate the adaptive stress response and plant fertility of rice as a transcription factor
    + A bZIP transcription factor, OsABI5, is involved in rice fertility and stress tolerance
    + Molecular and genetic analyses demonstrate that a drought regime enhances expression of the OsABF1 gene, which indirectly suppresses expression of the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene that encodes a key activator of rice flowering
    + Furthermore, we identified a drought inducible gene named OsWRKY104 that is under the direct regulation of OsABF1
    + A Drought-inducible bZIP Transcription Factor OsABF1 Delays Reproductive Timing in Rice.
    + The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.
    + In this study, we show that when overexpressed in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa), the bZIP transcription factor OsABF1 confers distinctly different drought-tolerance phenotypes when tethered to the transcriptional activator VP16 versus the transcriptional repressor EAR
    + Analysis of the overlap between the RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data identified 242 OsABF1 target genes involved in multiple aspects of the drought response
    + In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway
    + It is suggested that OsABF1 recruits RRC2-mediated H3K27me3 deposition on the SD1 promoter, thus epigenetically silencing SD1 to maintain the GA homeostasis for growth and seed germination
    + OsABF1 Represses Gibberellin Biosynthesis to Regulate Plant Height and Seed Germination in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Here, we report the functional characterization of a GA-inducible OsABF1 in GA biosynthesis underpinning plant height and seed germination
    + Overexpression of OsABF1 produced a typical GA-deficient phenotype with semi-dwarf and retarded seed germination
    + Meanwhile, the phenotypes could be rescued by exogenous GA(3), suggesting that OsABF1 is a key regulator of GA homeostasis
    + These findings shed new insight into the functions of OsABF1 and regulatory mechanism underlying GA homeostasis in rice
    + OsABF1 could directly suppress the transcription of green revolution gene SD1, thus reducing the endogenous GA level in rice
    + Furthermore, the upregulated expression of OsABI5 was detected in wild type (WT) under drought stress, irrespective of MT treatment, whereas OsABI5 was significantly downregulated in sgt1 and sgt1abi5 mutants
