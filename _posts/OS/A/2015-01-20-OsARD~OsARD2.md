## Key message
1. __submergence__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D), " OsARD1 mRNA levels showed a rapid, early and transient increase upon submergence and after treatment with ethylene-releasing compounds"
2. __phytohormone__, [Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR analysis revealed that the OsARD expression is regulated by abiotic stresses and phytohormones
3. __ethylene__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D),  OsARD1 mRNA levels showed a rapid, early and transient increase upon submergence and after treatment with ethylene-releasing compounds
4. __ethylene__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D),  OsARD1 transcripts accumulated in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, indicating that OsARD1 is a primary ethylene response gene
5. __ethylene__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D),  Promoter analysis suggests that immediate-early regulation of OsARD1 by ethylene may involve an EIN3-like transcription factor
6. __ethylene__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D),  OsARD1 is induced by low levels of ethylene
7. __ethylene__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D), The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine
8. __abiotic stress__, [Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR analysis revealed that the OsARD expression is regulated by abiotic stresses and phytohormones
9. __abiotic stress__, [Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsARD may play a role in the metabolism of methionine and ethylene in response to abiotic stresses
10. __transcription factor__, [The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine%5BTitle%5D),  Promoter analysis suggests that immediate-early regulation of OsARD1 by ethylene may involve an EIN3-like transcription factor
11. __root__, [Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsARD was mainly expressed in roots under flood conditions
12. __ethylene__, [Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsARD may play a role in the metabolism of methionine and ethylene in response to abiotic stresses
