* **Key message**  
    + Treatment of aerobic seedlings with ethylene and its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), rapidly induced the expression of OsABA8ox1, but the ethylene treatment did not strongly affect the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes
    + Moreover, pre-treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, partially suppressed induction of OsABA8ox1 expression under submergence
    + Together, these results indicate that the rapid decrease in ABA levels in submerged rice shoots is controlled partly by ethylene-induced expression of OsABA8ox1 and partly by ethylene-independent suppression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ABA
    + Ethylene promotes submergence-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, a gene that encodes ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice
    + The oxidation of ABA to PA is catalyzed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, which is possibly encoded by three genes (OsABA8ox1, -2 and -3) in rice
    + The ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity was confirmed in microsomes from yeast expressing OsABA8ox1
    + The ABA level was found to be negatively correlated with OsABA8ox1 expression under ACC or 1-MCP treatment
    + The mRNA level of OsABA8ox1, but not the mRNA levels of other OsABA8ox genes, increased dramatically within 1 h after submergence
