## Expression information

## Key message
1. __blast resistance__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
2. __blight__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
3. __leaf__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade
4. __leaf__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
5. __panicle__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
6. __bacterial blight__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
7. __blast__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
8. __sheath__, [Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
