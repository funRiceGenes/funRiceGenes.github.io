* **Key message**  
    + Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes
    + In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight
    + The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade
    + In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath
