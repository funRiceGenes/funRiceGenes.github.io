* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
    + OsHPL2-overexpressing transgenic rice plants exhibited increased resistance to bacterial blight
