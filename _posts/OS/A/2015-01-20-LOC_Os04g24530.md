* **Key message**  
    + ACOS5 and OsACOS12 are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species
    + The localization of OsACOS12-GFP demonstrated that OsACOS12 protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules
    + The osacos12 mutation caused by a pre-mature stop codon in LOC_Os04g24530 exhibits defective sexine resulting in a male sterile phenotype in rice
    + OsACOS12 driven by the ACOS5 promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos5 mutant in Arabidopsis
    + In situ hybridization shows that OsACOS12 is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores at the transcript level
    + Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility
    + Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.
    + Those phenotypic changes were evident at stage 10, during which OsACOS12 had its maximum expression in tapetal cells and microspores
    + A complementation test showed that OsACOS12 driven by the ACOS5 promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos5 mutant in Arabidopsis, while PpACOS6 did not rescue the acos5 phenotype

    + __OsACOS12__, __STS1~OsLDDT1~OsSTS1__, [SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SWOLLEN TAPETUM AND STERILITY 1 Is Required for Tapetum Degeneration and Pollen Wall Formation in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice
    + __OsACOS12__, __OsTKPR2__, [OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
