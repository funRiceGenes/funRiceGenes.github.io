4. __leaf__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  OsATX was responsive to cutting wounding by cutting the excised leaf), over its weak constitutive expression in the healthy leaves
5. __leaf__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid JA), salicylic acid SA), abscisic acid ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
6. __blast__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  Finally, the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, triggered OsATX mRNA accumulation
7. __jasmonic acid__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid JA), salicylic acid SA), abscisic acid ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
8. __salicylic acid__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid JA), salicylic acid SA), abscisic acid ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
9. __ethylene__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid JA), salicylic acid SA), abscisic acid ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect
10. __defense__, [Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  These results strongly suggest a function/roles for OsATX in defense/stress responses in rice
