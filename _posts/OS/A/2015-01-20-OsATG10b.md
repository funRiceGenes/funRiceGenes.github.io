* **Key message**  
    + These results demonstrate that OsATG10b plays an important role in the survival of rice cells against oxidative stresses
    + OsATG10b, an autophagosome component, is needed for cell survival against oxidative stresses in rice
    + Those osatg10b mutants were sensitive to treatments with high salt and methyl viologen (MV)
