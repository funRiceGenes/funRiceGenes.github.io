* **Key message**  
    + OsANN1-knockdown [RNA interference (RNAi)] plants were more sensitive to heat and drought stresses, whereas OsANN1-overexpression (OE) lines showed improved growth with higher expression of OsANN1 under abiotic stress
    + OsANN1 also has calcium-binding and ATPase activities in vitro, indicating that OsANN1 has multiple functions in rice growth
    + Here it is reported that OsANN1 confers abiotic stress tolerance by modulating antioxidant accumulation under abiotic stress
    + Overexpression of OsANN1 promoted SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) activities, which regulate H2O2 content and redox homeostasis, suggesting the existence of a feedback mechanism between OsANN1 and H2O2 production under abiotic stress
    + Higher expression of OsANN1 can provide overall cellular protection against abiotic stress-induced damage, and a significant accumulation of OsANN1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals was found in the cytosol after heat shock treatment
    + Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.

    + __HAN1__, __OsANN1__, [Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calcium binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.%5BTitle%5D),  By yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that OsANN1 interacted with a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, HAN1 (&quot;HAN&quot; termed &quot;chilling&quot; in Chinese), which has been reported to catalyze the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile)
