    + LMPA Regulates Lesion Mimic Leaf and Panicle Development Through ROS-Induced PCD in Rice.
    + These results provide a better understanding of the role of LMPA in panicle development and lesion mimic formation by regulating ROS homeostasis
    + Molecular cloning revealed that LMPA encodes a proton pump ATPase protein that is localized in the plasma membrane and is highly expressed in leaves and panicles
    + Moreover, physiological experiments revealed that lmpa was more sensitive to high temperatures and salt stress conditions
    + Cellular and histochemistry analysis indicated that the ROS accumulated and cell death occurred in lmpa
