## Key message
1. __auxin__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D)), Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
2. __auxin response__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D)), Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.

## Connection
1. __OsARF24__, __FH5~RMD~BUI1__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D)), Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
2. __OsARF24__, __FH5~RMD~BUI1__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D)), In support of this regulatory loop, osarf23 and lines with reduced expression of both OsARF23 and OsARF24 display reduced RMD expression, disrupted F-actin organization and cell growth, less sensitivity to auxin response, and altered auxin distribution and OsPIN localization.
