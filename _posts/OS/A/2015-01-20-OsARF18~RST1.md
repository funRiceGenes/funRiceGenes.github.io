* **Key message**  
    + Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710
    + The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions of OsARF18 and OsARF22
    + Additionally, overexpression of OsARF18 decreased the transcription of downstream genes PLT1 and PLT2, and inhibited callus formation of mature embryo
    + Loss of RST1 function increased the expression of OsAS1 and improved nitrogen (N) utilization by promoting asparagine production and avoiding excess ammonium (NH(4)(+)) accumulation
    + Transcriptional repressor RST1 controls salt tolerance and grain yield in rice by regulating gene expression of asparagine synthetase.
    + Map-based cloning revealed that the gene RST1 encoded an auxin response factor (OsARF18)
    + RST1 was undergoing directional selection during domestication
