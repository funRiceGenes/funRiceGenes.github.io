* **Key message**  
    + Ectopically overexpressed OsADF3 conferred the mannitol- and drought-stress tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings by increasing germination rate, primary root length and survival
    + Comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed rice actin depolymerizing factor gene family and heterologous overexpression of OsADF3 confers Arabidopsis Thaliana drought tolerance
    + Under ABA or abiotic stress treatments, OsADF3::GUS activity was enhanced in lateral roots and root tips
