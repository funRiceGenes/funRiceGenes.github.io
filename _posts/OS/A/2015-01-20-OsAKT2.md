* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions
    + Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane
    + Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.
    + Multiple basic amino acid residues contribute to phosphatidic acid-mediated inhibition of rice potassium channel OsAKT2
    + Here, using a PA biosensor (PAleon), we found that the exogenous PA treatment significantly increased the PA level at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes which were used to express OsAKT2 for electrophysiological assays
    + Rice shaker potassium channel OsAKT2 positively regulates salt tolerance and grain yield by mediating K + redistribution
    + In addition, OsAKT2 also regulates the translocation of K+ and sucrose from old leaves to young leaves, and affects grain shape and yield
    + Here, we provide physiological and genetic evidence of the involvement of phloem-localized OsAKT2 in rice salt tolerance
    + Under salt stress, a T-DNA knock-out mutant, osakt2 and two CRISPR lines showed a more sensitive phenotype and higher Na+ accumulation than wild type
    + Disruption of OsAKT2 decreases K+ concentration in phloem sap and inhibits shoot-to-root redistribution of K+
