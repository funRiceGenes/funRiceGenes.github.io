* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions
    + Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane
    + Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.
    + Multiple basic amino acid residues contribute to phosphatidic acid-mediated inhibition of rice potassium channel OsAKT2
    + Here, using a PA biosensor (PAleon), we found that the exogenous PA treatment significantly increased the PA level at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes which were used to express OsAKT2 for electrophysiological assays
