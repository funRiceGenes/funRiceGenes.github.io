* **Key message**  
    + Knockdown of OsAGO2 led to the overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal anther development, causing premature initiation of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen abortion
    + Moreover, knockdown of OsHXK1 restored pollen fertility in OsAGO2 knockdown plants
    + Here, we show that the AGO protein OsAGO2 regulates anther development in rice
    + OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.
    + These results indicate that OsHXK1 controls the appropriate production of ROS and the proper timing of tapetal PCD and is directly regulated by OsAGO2 through epigenetic regulation
