* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsAAA-ATPase1 significantly enhanced pathogenesis-related gene expression and the resistance to M
    + Recombinant OsAAA-ATPase1 synthesized in Escherichia coli showed ATPase activity
    + Here, we report the functional analysis of OsAAA-ATPase1 in rice's defense response to M
    + Rice OsAAA-ATPase1 is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.
    + OsAAA-ATPase1 transcription was induced by exogenous treatment with a functional analogue of salicylic acid (SA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), but not by other plant hormones tested
