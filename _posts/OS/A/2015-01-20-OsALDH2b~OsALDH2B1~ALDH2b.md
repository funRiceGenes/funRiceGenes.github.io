* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that ALDH2b was constitutively present in all the organs examined, whereas ALDH2a was expressed in leaves of dark-grown seedlings and panicles
    + We suggest that the rice ALDH2a and ALDH2b genes are orthologues of maize mitochondrial ALDH genes, rf2b and rf2a, respectively
    + Organ-specific expressions and chromosomal locations of two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), ALDH2a and ALDH2b
    + The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetum degeneration in rice.
    + These results demonstrate that OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetal PCD and is required for male reproductive development, providing insights into the regulation of tapetum development in plants.
    + Loss of function of OsALDH2B1 greatly enhanced resistance to broad-spectrum pathogens, including fungal blast, bacterial leaf blight, and leaf streak, but caused severe phenotypic changes such as male sterility and reduced plant size, grain size, and number
    + OsALDH2B1 has its primary function as an aldehyde dehydrogenase and a moonlight function as a transcriptional regulator
