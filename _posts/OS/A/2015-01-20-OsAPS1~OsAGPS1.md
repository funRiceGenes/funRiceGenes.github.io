* **Key message**  
    + OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
    + Subcellular localization studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs indicate that OsAGPS2a, the product of the leaf-preferential transcript of OsAGPS2, and OsAGPS1, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL3, and OsAGPL4 are plastid-targeted isoforms
