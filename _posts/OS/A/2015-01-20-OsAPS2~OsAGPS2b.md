* **Key message**  
    + Analysis of osagps2 and osagpl2 mutants revealed that a lesion of one of the two cytosolic isoforms, OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b, causes a shrunken endosperm due to a remarkable reduction in starch synthesis
    + In contrast, two isoforms, SSU OsAGPS2b which is a product of a seed-specific transcript of OsAGPS2, and LSU OsAGPL2, are localized in the cytosol
    + Western blot analysis of the osagp mutants and wild type plants demonstrated that OsAGPS2a is an SSU isoform mainly present in leaves, and that OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 are the major SSU and LSU isoforms, respectively, in the endosperm
    + OsAPS2 and OsAPL4 were constitutively expressed and these isoforms were coordinated with starch accumulation in the developing rice seed
