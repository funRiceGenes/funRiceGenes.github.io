* **Key message**  
    + We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
    + Similarly, there were undetectable levels of aldehydes in rice roots, in spite of the presence of OsHPL1 transcripts
    + OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
