## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
2. __shoot__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
3. __root__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  Similarly, there were undetectable levels of aldehydes in rice roots, in spite of the presence of OsHPL1 transcripts
4. __sheath__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
5. __leaf__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves

## Connection
1. __OsAOS1__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
2. __OsAOS1__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D),  The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts
3. __OsAOS3~OsHPL2__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
4. __OsAOS3~OsHPL2__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 metabolize 9-/13-hydroperoxides, whereas OsHPL3 metabolizes 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid exclusively
5. __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, __OsHPL3__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  There are three HPLs in rice Oryza sativa), designated OsHPL1 through OsHPL3
6. __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, __OsHPL3__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
7. __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, __OsHPL3__, [Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 metabolize 9-/13-hydroperoxides, whereas OsHPL3 metabolizes 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid exclusively
