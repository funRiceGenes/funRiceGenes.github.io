## Key message
1. __cell death__, [EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
2. __tapetum__, [EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants

## Connection
1. __OsAP25__, __OsAP37__, [EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
2. __GUDK__, __OsAP37__, [Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.%5BTitle%5D),  Phosphoproteome profiling of the mutant followed by in vitro assays identified the transcription factor APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR OsAP37 as a phosphorylation target of GUDK
3. __GUDK__, __OsAP37__, [Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.%5BTitle%5D),  Our transactivation assays confirmed that GUDK is required for activation of stress genes by OsAP37
4. __GUDK__, __OsAP37__, [Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.%5BTitle%5D),  We propose that GUDK mediates drought stress signaling through phosphorylation and activation of OsAP37, resulting in transcriptional activation of stress-regulated genes, which impart tolerance and improve yield under drought
5. __GUDK__, __OsAP37__, [Regulation of grain yield in rice under well-watered and drought stress conditions by GUDK.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of grain yield in rice under well-watered and drought stress conditions by GUDK.%5BTitle%5D),  Recently, we functionally characterized a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, named GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE (GUDK), revealing its role in regulating grain yield under well-watered and drought stress conditions by transphosphorylating the OsAP37 transcription factor
