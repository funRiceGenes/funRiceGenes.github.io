* **Key message**  
    + Proper expression of Osa-miR159a was critical for coordinating rice blast resistance with grain development
    + Fine-Tuning Roles of Osa-miR159a in Rice Immunity Against Magnaporthe oryzae and Development
    + Alteration of the expression of Osa-miR159a impacted yield traits including pollen and grain development
    + Conclusions: Our results indicated that Osa-miR159a positively regulated rice immunity against M
    + The expression of Osa-miR159a was suppressed in a susceptible accession at 12, 24, and 48 h post-inoculation (hpi); it was upregulated in a resistant accession of M
    + The transgenic rice lines overexpressing Osa-miR159a were highly resistant to M

* **Connection**  
    + __Osa-miR159a__, __OsMYBGA~OsGAMYB__, [Fine-Tuning Roles of Osa-miR159a in Rice Immunity Against Magnaporthe oryzae and Development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Fine-Tuning Roles of Osa-miR159a in Rice Immunity Against Magnaporthe oryzae and Development%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout mutations of the target genes of Osa-miR159a, including OsGAMYB, OsGAMYBL, and OsZF, led to resistance to M
