* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, OsABAR1-OX seedlings were hypersensitive to exogenous ABA, whereas Osabar1 seedlings were hyposensitive
    + Moreover, OsABAR1 expression was up-regulated by  drought and salinity stresses
    + These results imply that OsABAR1 is a positive regulator of the ABA pathway and confirm that OsABAR1 improves rice drought and salt tolerance via an ABA-dependent pathway
    + In turn, OsABAR1 regulated the expression of ABA metabolic genes and responsive genes
    + The OsABAR1 protein was localized in  the cytoplasm and nucleus
    + We further analyzed the involvement of OsABAR1 in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway
    + The OsABAR1 expression level was up-regulated by ABA
