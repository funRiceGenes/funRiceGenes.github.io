## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study, we found that expression of the rice Aconitase gene OsACO1 is induced in a time-dependent manner by heat but not other typical abiotic stresses |  Using qualitative and quantitative analyses, we found that the expression of the GUS reporter gene responded to heat in different tissues and at different stages of development when driven by POsACO1 |  A series of 5' distal deletions of POsACO1 was generated to delineate the region responsible for heat-induced gene expression |  Transient expression analyses in tobacco leaves identified a 322-bp minimal region between -1386 and -1065 as being essential and sufficient for heat-induced expression by POsACO1 |  We screened for known heat response-related cis-elements in this 322-bp region; however, sequences correlating with heat-induced gene expression were not identified in POsACO1
