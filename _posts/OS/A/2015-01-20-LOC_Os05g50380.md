* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, ABA alone did not affect the gene expression of OsAPL3 and starch content
    + Collectively, these results indicated that the expression level of OsAPL3 and starch content in the cultured cells were cooperatively controlled by alterations in the concentration of both sucrose and ABA
    + OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
