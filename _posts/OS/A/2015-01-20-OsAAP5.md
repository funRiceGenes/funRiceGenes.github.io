* **Key message**  
    + Lower expression of OsAAP5 in the young leaf blade in indica varieties than in japonica varieties was associated with more tillers in indica than in japonica
    + The amino acid permease OsAAP5 regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice.
    + Downregulation of OsAAP5 expression in japonica using RNA interference (Ri) and CRISPR led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, while OsAAP5 overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect
    + Thus, OsAAP5 could regulate tiller bud outgrowth by affecting cytokinin levels, and knockout of OsAAP5 could be valuable for japonica breeding programs seeking high yield and grain quality
