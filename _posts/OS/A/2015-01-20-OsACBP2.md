* **Key message**  
    + Herein, rice OsACBP2 was demonstrated not only to play a role in seed development and germination, but also to influence grain size
    + When OsACBP2 function was investigated using osacbp2 mutants and transgenic rice overexpressing OsACBP2 (OsACBP2-OE), osacbp2 was retarded in germination, while OsACBP2-OEs performed better than the wild-type and vector-transformed controls, in germination, seedling growth, grain size, and grain weight
    + Deletion analysis of the OsACBP2 5'-flanking region revealed five copies of the seed cis-element, Skn-I-like motif (-1486/-1482, -956/-952, -939/-935, -826/-822, and -766/-762), and the removal of any adversely affected expression in seeds, thereby providing a molecular basis for OsACBP2 expression in seeds
    + As dietary rice bran contains beneficial bioactive components, OsACBP2 appears to be a promising candidate for enriching seed nutritional value
    + OsACBP2 mRNA accumulated in embryos and endosperm of germinating seeds in qRT-PCR analysis, while Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) assays on OsACBP2pro::GUS rice transformants showed GUS expression in embryos, as well as the scutellum and aleurone layer of germinating seeds
