* **Publication**  
    + [Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Root cellular expression of OsACTPK1 also overlapped with that of ammonium-induced OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2
    + Furthermore, introduction of OsACTPK1 cDNA fused to the synthetic green fluorescence protein under its own promoter complemented growth and the HATS influx, and suggested plasma membrane localization
    + Using transcriptome and reverse genetics in ammonium-preferring rice, we revealed the role of the serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase gene OsACTPK1 in down-modulation of HATS under sufficient ammonium
