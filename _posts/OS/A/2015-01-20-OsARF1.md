* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, the OsARF1 was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development
    + OsARF1 is the first full-length member of auxin response factor (ARF) gene family to be cloned from monocot plant
    + Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice
    + A rice homologue of the auxin response factor (ARF) family of transcriptional regulators, OsARF1, was identified
    + Steady-state levels of OsARF1 mRNA correlated positively with auxin-dependent differential growth: gravitropic stimulation enhanced the amount of OsARF1 transcript in the lower, faster-growing flank accompanied by a decrease in the upper flank of gravitropically stimulated rice coleoptiles
    + Exogenous auxin up-regulated the steady-state level of OsARF1 mRNA within 15-30 min
    + Thus, OsARF1 is the first ARF that classifies as an early auxin-responsive gene
    + OsARF1, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene
    + In R109 leaves, the OsARF1 gene, which regulates plant growth, was expressed in consistence with growth promotion by P
    + Inversely, OsARF1 expression was coincident with inhibition in growth of HER1 leaves
    + The AS-OsARF1 plants showed extremely low growth, poor vigor, short curled leaves and tillered but were sterile
    + Using quantitative RT-PCR this study found that, the transcript abundance of OsARF1 was significantly higher in embryonic tissues than in vegetative tissues
