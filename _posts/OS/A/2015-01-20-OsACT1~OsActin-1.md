## Key message
1. __actin protein__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D), GSD1 functioned in affecting PD conductance by interacting with OsACT1 in association with the PD callose binding protein PDCB1.

## Connection
1. __GSD1__, __OsACT1__, [Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance%5BTitle%5D), GSD1 functioned in affecting PD conductance by interacting with OsACT1 in association with the PD callose binding protein PDCB1.
2. __GSD1__, __OsACT1~OsActin-1__, [Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.%5BTitle%5D), Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.
3. __GSD1__, __OsACT1~OsActin-1__, [Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain in GSD1 is necessary for sufficient interaction with OsACT1
4. __GSD1__, __OsACT1~OsActin-1__, [Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Grain setting defect1 GSD1 function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 OsACT1 at its C-terminal.%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results reveal that GSD1 attaches to the PM through S-acylation and interacts with OsACT1 through its coiled-coil domain structure to regulate plasmodesmata conductance for photoassimilate transport in rice
