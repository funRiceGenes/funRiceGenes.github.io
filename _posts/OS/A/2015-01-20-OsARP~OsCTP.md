* **Key message**  
    + The OsARP gene was introduced into tobacco under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter
    + Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type
    + Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco
