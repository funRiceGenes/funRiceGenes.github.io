* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM changed ABA sensitivity, validating the in vitro results
    + The effects of the second and forth residues on the interaction of OsPP2C50 with several OsPYL/RCAR proteins were investigated by systematic mutagenesis
    + The water-mediated interaction between the wedging Trp-259 of OsPP2C50 and pyrabactin is lost, undermining the structural integrity of the ABA receptor:co-receptor
    + OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice
    + We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 showed significantly higher water loss than control
