## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  OsACX2 was expressed predominantly in seeds
2. __seed__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
3. __jasmonic__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
4. __jasmonic acid__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding

## Connection
1. __OsACX2__, __OsACX3__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively
2. __OsACX2__, __OsACX3__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of OsACX2 and OsACX3 remained unchanged
3. __OsACX1__, __OsACX2__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively
4. __OsACX1__, __OsACX2__, [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
