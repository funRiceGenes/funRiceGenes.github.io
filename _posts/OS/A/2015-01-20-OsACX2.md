* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsACX2  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os11g39220](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g39220)  
    + RAPdb: [Os11g0605500](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os11g0605500)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding%5BTitle%5D), 2007, J Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [DP000010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/DP000010)

* **Key message**  
    + OsACX2 was expressed predominantly in seeds
    + It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding
