## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
2. __pollen__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In the Osam1 mutant, pollen mother cells are arrested at leptotene, showing that OsAM1 is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition
3. __meiotic__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
4. __meiotic__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8
5. __meiotic__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
