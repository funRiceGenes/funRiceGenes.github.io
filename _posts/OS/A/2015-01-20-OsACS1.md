## Connection
1. __OsACO1__, __OsACS1__, [ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants
2. __OsACO1__, __OsACS1__, [ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ACO1, a gene for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase: effects on internode elongation at the heading stage in rice%5BTitle%5D),  This study suggests that the ACO1 has a little effect on internode elongation at the heading stage, and that up-regulation of the ACS1 and OsEIN2 expression may attenuate inhibition of internode elongation

Habiganj Aman II) during partial submergence%5BTitle%5D),  Herein we have studied the expression characteristics of two members of the five-member multigene family encoding ACC synthase in rice OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2 and show that partial submergence induces expression of OS-ACS1 and suppresses expression of OS-ACS2
