* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptome sequencing of both nursed and un-nursed Osadk1 mutants then revealed that the mutation of OsADK1 could greatly affect the AM symbiotic programme, including many key transcription factors such as RAM1 and WRI5
    + In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development
    + OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching
