* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptome sequencing of both nursed and un-nursed Osadk1 mutants then revealed that the mutation of OsADK1 could greatly affect the AM symbiotic programme, including many key transcription factors such as RAM1 and WRI5
    + In this study, we identified a novel kinase gene in rice named OsADK1 (Arbuscule Development Kinase 1) that is required for arbuscule development
    + OsADK1 therefore represents a new rice kinase that is required for arbuscule branching
    + OsADK1 appeared to be required for mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule development
    + A PHR-regulated receptor-like kinase, OsADK1 is required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and phosphate starvation responses.
    + In addition, Hydroponic experiments suggested that OsADK1 may be involved in plant Pi starvation responses

* **Connection**  
    + __OsADK1__, __OsPHR2__, [A PHR-regulated receptor-like kinase, OsADK1 is required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and phosphate starvation responses.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A PHR-regulated receptor-like kinase, OsADK1 is required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and phosphate starvation responses.%5BTitle%5D),  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation assays showed that OsPHR2 can bind directly to the P1BS elements within the OsADK1 promoter to activate its transcription
