* **Key message**  
    + In the osatm3 T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short
    + Promoter-¦Â-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions
    + Massive cell death occurred in the osatm3 root tip meristem zone
    + Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the osatm3 and RNAi lines involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest
    + Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both osatm3 and RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines
    + The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the osatm3 and RNAi lines
    + Glutathione metabolism was impaired and reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide, accumulated in osatm3
