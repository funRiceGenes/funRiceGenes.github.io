* **Key message**  
    + An ADF isolated from a monocot halophyte, Spartina alterniflora (SaADF2) imparted significantly higher level of drought and salinity tolerance when expressed in rice than its rice homologue OsADF2
    + Rice transgenics constitutively overexpressing SaADF2 (SaADF2-OE) showed better growth, relative water content, and photosynthetic and agronomic yield under drought conditions than wild-type (WT) and OsADF2 overexpressers (OsADF2-OE)
    + SaADF2 differs from OsADF2 by a few amino acid residues, including a substitution in the regulatory phosphorylation site serine-6, which accounted for its weak interaction with OsCDPK6 (calcium dependent protein kinase), thus resulting in an increased efficacy of SaADF2 and enhanced cellular actin dynamics
