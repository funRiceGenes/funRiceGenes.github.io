* **Key message**  
    + OsAUX3 expression in PRs, LRs and RHs further supports that OsAUX3 plays a critical role in the regulation of root development
    + OsAUX3 is upregulated in the root apex under aluminium (Al) stress and osaux3-2 is insensitive to Al treatments
    + Auxin concentrations, Al contents and Al-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in osaux3-2 under Al stress are lower than in WT, indicating that OsAUX3 is involved in Al-induced inhibition of root growth
    + OsAUX3 locates at the plasma membrane and functions as an auxin influx carrier affecting acropetal auxin transport
