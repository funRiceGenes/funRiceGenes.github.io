* **Key message**  
    + OsAUX3 expression in PRs, LRs and RHs further supports that OsAUX3 plays a critical role in the regulation of root development
    + OsAUX3 is upregulated in the root apex under aluminium (Al) stress and osaux3-2 is insensitive to Al treatments
    + Auxin concentrations, Al contents and Al-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in osaux3-2 under Al stress are lower than in WT, indicating that OsAUX3 is involved in Al-induced inhibition of root growth
    + OsAUX3 locates at the plasma membrane and functions as an auxin influx carrier affecting acropetal auxin transport
    + RNA-sequencing, gene expression quantification, dual-luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and yeast one-hybrid assay demonstrated that OsARF6 is an upstream transcription factor of OsAUX3
    + OsARF6 directly binds to the auxin response elements of the OsAUX3 promoter, covering a single nucleotide polymorphism site between 9311 and NPB/Dongjin/Hwayoung, thereby controlling GL by altering longitudinal expansion and auxin distribution/content in glume cells
    + Herein, a quantitative trait locus qGL5 for grain length (GL) and GW was identified in recombinant inbred lines of 9311 and Nipponbare (NPB), and fine mapped to a candidate gene, OsAUX3
