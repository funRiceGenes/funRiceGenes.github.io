* **Key message**  
    + To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1
    + OsAKT1 transcripts were predominantly found in the coleoptile and in the roots of young rice seedlings
    + Patch-clamp studies on rice root protoplasts identified a K+ inward rectifier with similar channel properties as heterologously expressed OsAKT1
    + In line with the transcriptional downregulation of OsAKT1 in response to salt stress, inward K+ currents were significantly reduced in root protoplasts
    + Thus, OsAKT1 seems to represent the dominant salt-sensitive K+ uptake channel in rice roots
    + Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress
    + The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex
    + Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K+ content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development.
    + The most prominent result of OsAKT1 overexpression was a reduction in sensitivity to osmotic/drought stress in transgenic plants: the data suggest that AKT1 overexpression improved rice osmotic and drought stress tolerance by increasing tissue levels of K(+), especially in the root
    + However, loss-of-function of OsAKT1 increased the sensitivity to excess Fe regarding leaf bronzing symptoms, reactive oxygen species generation, leaf spectral reflectance indices, and chlorophyll fluorescence
    + In conclusion, OsAKT1 is crucial for the tolerance of rice against Fe toxicity as K homeostasis affects Fe translocation from root to shoot
