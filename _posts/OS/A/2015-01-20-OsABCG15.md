* **Key message**  
    + Based on map-based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459-bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, OsABCG15, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility
    + Consistently, histological analysis showed that osabcg15 mutants developed obvious abnormality in postmeiotic tapetum degeneration, leading to rapid degredation of young microspores
    + Expression analysis showed that OsABCG15 is expressed specifically in developmental anthers from stage 8 (meiosis II stage) to stage 10 (late microspore stage)
    + Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
    + The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice
    + The results suggest that OsABCG15 plays a critical role in exine formation and pollen development, similar to the homologous gene of AtABCG26 in Arabidopsis
    + OsABCG15 encodes a membrane protein that plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation in rice.
    + An ABC transporter gene ( OsABCG15 ) was proven to be involved in pollen development in rice
    + This osabcg15 mutant failed to produce any viable pollen and was completely male sterile
    + Histological analysis indicated that osabcg15 exhibited an undeveloped anther cuticle, enlarged middle layer, abnormal Ubisch body development, tapetum degeneration with a falling apart style, and collapsed pollen grains without detectable exine
    + Our results suggested that OsABCG15 played an essential role in the formation of the rice anther cuticle and pollen exine
    + OsABCG15 encodes a membrane protein that plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation in rice
