* **Key message**  
    + Conversely, knocking out OsACE2 resulted in compromised growth phenotypes compared to the wild-type (WT)
    + Collectively, OsACE2 plays a primary role in catabolizing OFF residues in rice through multiple degradation pathways and reducing OFF in its growth environment
    + To demonstrate the regulatory role of OsACE2 in resistance to OFF toxicity, we generated OsACE2 overexpression (OE) and knockout mutant using genetic transformation and gene-editing technologies (CRISPR/Cas9)
    + Acetyltransferase OsACE2 acts as a regulator to reduce the environmental risk of oxyfluorfen to rice production
    + In this study, we characterized a new functional locus encoding an acetyltransferase (OsACE2) that can facilitate OFF degradation in rice.
