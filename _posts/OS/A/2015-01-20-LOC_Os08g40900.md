* **Key message**  
    + To investigate how rice grain yield traits are regulated by auxin signaling pathways and to facilitate their application in rice improvement, we validated the functional relationships among regulatory genes such as OsIAA10, OsSK41, and OsARF21 that are involved in one of the auxin (OsIAA10) signaling pathways
    + Based on the results, we constructed a model that showed how grain yield traits were regulated by OsIAA10 and OsTIR1, OsAFB2, and OsSK41 and OsmiR393 in the OsSK41-OsIAA10-OsARF module and by OsARF21 in the transcriptional regulation of downstream auxin response genes in the OsSK41-OsIAA10-OsARF module
