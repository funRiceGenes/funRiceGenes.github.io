* **Key message**  
    + Differences in the proportion of seedlings with expanded cotyledons and root lengths, and the lack of differences in germination rates between OsAIR1-overexpressing lines and control plants under AsV stress, suggest that OsAIR1 may positively regulate post-germination plant growth under stress conditions
    + OsAIR1 expression was induced under abiotic stress conditions, including drought, salt, heat, and As exposure
