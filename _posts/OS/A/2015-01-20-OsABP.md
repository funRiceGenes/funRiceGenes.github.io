* **Key message**  
    + In the present study, we report on the identification of a new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice which is upregulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments including NaCl, dehydration, ABA, blue and red light
    + These results imply that OsABP might perform important functions in the cellular response to specific abiotic stress
