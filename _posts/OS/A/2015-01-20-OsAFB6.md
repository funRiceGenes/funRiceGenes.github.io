* **Key message**  
    + It would be a beneficial strategy to generate lines with varied expression levels of OsAFB6 to breed high-yielding cultivars for specific regions that can fully utilize the local sunlight and temperature resources
    + Overexpression of an auxin receptor OsAFB6 significantly enhanced grain yield by increasing cytokinin and decreasing auxin concentrations in rice panicle.
    + Overexpression of OsAFB6 delayed heading, increased cytokinin (CK) by suppressing the expression level of Gn1a and simultaneously decreased the IAA concentration in the young panicle, which promoted inflorescence meristem development and resulted in large panicles with more spikelets per panicle, primary branches and increased grain yield
    + OsAFB6 is preferentially expressed in young tissues with stronger meristem activities and suppresses flowering by upregulating OsRR1 and downregulating Ehd1 expression levels
