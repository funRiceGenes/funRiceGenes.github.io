* **Key message**  
    + Together, our results show that OsAGO1d acts as a mobile signal to fine-tune phasiRNA production and this function is important for male fertility at low temperature
    + Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development
    + OsAGO1d protein moves from anther wall cells into meiocytes, where it loads miR2275 to produce 24-nt phasiRNAs
