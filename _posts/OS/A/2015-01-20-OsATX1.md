* **Key message**  
    + At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were significantly increased in OsATX1-overexpressing plants and decreased in osatx1 mutants compared to that in wild type
    + Knocking out OsATX1 resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas OsATX1 overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots
    + In addition, heterologous expression of OsATX1 in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cadmium (Cd)-sensitive mutant Î”ycf1 increased the tolerance to Cu and Cd by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells
    + These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P1B-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues
