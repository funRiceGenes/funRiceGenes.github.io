* **Key message**  
    + By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease
    + Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses
    + Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains
    + Osa-miR167d facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.
    + Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M
    + Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M
    + The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M
