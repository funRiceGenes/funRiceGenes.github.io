* **Publication**  
    + [eIF4A, a target of siRNA derived from rice stripe virus, negatively regulates antiviral autophagy by interacting with ATG5 in Nicotiana benthamiana.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=eIF4A, a target of siRNA derived from rice stripe virus, negatively regulates antiviral autophagy by interacting with ATG5 in Nicotiana benthamiana.%5BTitle%5D), 2021, PLoS Pathog.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Finally, we demonstrate that eIF4A from rice, the natural host of RSV, also interacts with OsATG5 and suppresses OsATG5-activated autophagy, pointing to the conserved function of eIF4A as a negative regulator of antiviral autophagy.
