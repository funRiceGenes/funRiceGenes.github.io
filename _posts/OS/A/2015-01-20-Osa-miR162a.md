* **Key message**  
    + Osa-miR162a fine-tunes rice resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Yield.
    + Overexpression of Osa-miR162a enhances rice resistance to M
    + Moreover, the transgenic lines overexpressing Osa-miR162a display decreased seed setting rate resulting in slight reduced yield per plant, whereas the transgenic lines blocking Osa-miR162 show an increased number of grains per panicle, resulting in increased yield per plant
    + In contrast, blocking Osa-miR162 by overexpressing a target mimic of Osa-miR162a enhances susceptibility to blast fungus associating with compromised induction of defense-related gene expression and H2O2 accumulation
    + Here we demonstrate that Osa-miR162a fine-tunes rice immunity against M
    + Together, our results indicate that Osa-miR162a is involved in rice immunity against M
    + Consistently, overproduced osa-miR162a in transgenic rice plants compromised the fecundity of BPH adults fed with these plants, but meanwhile perturbed root and grain development
    + Overexpression of an Osa-miR162a Derivative in Rice Confers Cross-Kingdom RNA Interference-Mediated Brown Planthopper Resistance without Perturbing Host Development.
