* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrate that OsAPX7 might be involved in signaling transduction pathways related to drought stress response, contributing to the understanding of the physiological role of chloroplast APX isoforms in rice
    + In this work, we performed a functional study of the stromal APX in rice (OsAPX7) and demonstrated that silencing of OsAPX7 did not impact plant growth, redox state, or photosynthesis parameters
    + RNA-seq analyses indicate that the silencing of OsAPX7 did not lead to changes in the global expression of genes related to reactive oxygen species metabolism
