## Publication
1. [An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Plant Signal Behav.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth |  A detailed expression analysis revealed that 2 transcripts of OsASL1, OsASL1 | 2, showed different expression patterns; OsASL1  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __root__, [An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth
2. __root__, [An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of OsASL1 and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice
3. __growth__, [An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth
