* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Rice phenotypes with mutated OsABCG9 exhibited growth retardation and sensitivity to low humidity
    + OsABCG9 Is an Important ABC Transporter of Cuticular Wax Deposition in Rice.
    + However, OsABCG9 does not seem to be involved in cutin transportation, even though its ortholog in Arabidopsis, AtABCG11, transports both wax and cutin
