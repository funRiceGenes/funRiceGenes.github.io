    + [OsASHL1 and OsASHL2, two members of the COMPASS-like complex, control floral transition and plant development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsASHL1 and OsASHL2, two members of the COMPASS-like complex, control floral transition and plant development in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, J Genet Genomics.

* **Key message**  
    + Lower expression of Ehd1, OsVIL4, and OsMADS51 in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant background accompanies a delayed vegetative growth phase and photoperiod-sensitive phase compared with that in wild type
    + In addition, the expression of key genes in brassinosteroid and gibberellic acid metabolism is altered in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that the COMPASS-like complex regulates plant growth and development by modulating the levels of these two phytohormones
    + In summary, we demonstrate that OsASHL1 and OsASHL2 are important for floral transition and plant development
    + The osashl1 osashl2 double mutant shows a dwarf and late-flowering phenotype
