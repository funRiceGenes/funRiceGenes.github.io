* **Key message**  
    + A floury endosperm mutant, osagpl2-3, was isolated from the M2 generation of japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare following ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis
    + The osagpl2-3 mutant produced a white-core endosperm compared to the transparent endosperm of the wild type (WT)
    + Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice
    + The analysis for cooking and nutrition quality traits indicated that the values of gel consistency, gelatinization temperature, and rapid viscosity analysis profile of osagpl2-3 grains were lower than those of the WT
    + OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
    + The results from scanning electron microscope showed that the osagpl2-3 mutant grains comprised of round and loosely packed starch granules, some of which were compounded
    + Moreover, the expression of OsAGPL2 and its counterpart, OsAGPS2b, was highly coordinated in rice endosperm
    + Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays verified direct interactions between OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b as well as OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1, supporting the model for spatiotemporal complex formation of AGPase isoforms in rice endosperm
    + Grains of gif2 showed a slower filling rate and a significant lower final grain weight and yield compared to wild-type
    + All these results suggest that GIF2 plays important roles in the regulation of grain filling and starch biosynthesis during caryopsis development, and that it has been preserved during selection throughout domestication of modern rice
    + The starch content in gif2 was noticeably decreased and its physicochemical properties were also altered
    + Transcript levels for granule-bound starch synthase, starch synthase, starch branching enzyme and starch debranching enzyme were distinctly elevated in gif2 grains
    + Moreover, gif2 endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound granule formation
    + Positional cloning identified GIF2 to encode an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) large subunit, AGPL2; consequently, AGP enzyme activity in gif2 endosperms was remarkably decreased
    + This reflected the unanticipated expression of both OsAPL2 and OsAPS2b in the leaves, generating a complete ectopic AGPase in the leaf cytosol, and a corresponding decrease in the expression of the plastidial small subunit OsAPS2a that was only partially complemented by an increase in the expression of OsAPS1
    + The first committed step in the endosperm starch biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by the cytosolic glucose-1-phosphate adenylyl transferase (AGPase) comprising large and small subunits encoded by the OsAPL2 and OsAPS2b genes, respectively
    + OsAPL2 is expressed solely in the endosperm so we hypothesized that mutating this gene would block starch biosynthesis in the endosperm without affecting the leaves
