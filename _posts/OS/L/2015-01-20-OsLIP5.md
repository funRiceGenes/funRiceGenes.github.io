* **Key message**  
    + Here we report that rice OsLIP5 gene could fully restore both the disease resistance and salt tolerance of the Arabidopsis oslip5 mutant plants to the wild-type levels
    + Unlike Arabidopsis atlip5 mutants, rice oslip5 mutants were severely stunted, developed necrotic lesions and all died before flowering
