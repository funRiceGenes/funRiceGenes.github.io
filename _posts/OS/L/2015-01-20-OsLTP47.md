* **Key message**  
    + OsLTP47 may function in a lipid transfer relay essential for pollen wall development in rice.
    + These findings suggest that the plasma membrane-localized OsLTP47 may function as a mediator in a lipid transfer relay through association with cytosolic and/or locular OsC6 for pollen wall development and that various LTPs may function in a coordinated manner to transport lipid molecules during pollen wall development
    + Dysfunction of OsLTP47 causes disordered lipid metabolism and defective pollen walls, leading to male sterility
