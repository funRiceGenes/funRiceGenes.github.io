* **Key message**  
    + These data suggest that OsLOL2 is involved in rice growth and disease resistance
    + The rice OsLOL2 gene encodes a zinc finger protein involved in rice growth and disease resistance
    + Transgenic rice lines carrying the antisense strand of OsLOL2 with decreased expression of OsLOL2 had dwarf phenotypes, and the dwarfism could be restored by exogenous GA(3) treatment, suggesting that the dwarfism was the result of a deficiency in bioactive gibberellin (GA)
    + Sense transgenic lines with increased expression of OsLOL2 were more resistant to rice bacterial blight, while antisense transgenic lines were less resistant to rice bacterial blight
