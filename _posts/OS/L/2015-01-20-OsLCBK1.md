## Expression information

## Key message
1. __blast disease__, [Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease
2. __disease resistance__, [Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv
3. __cell death__, [Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death%5BTitle%5D),  Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes
4. __disease__, [Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease

9. __blast__, [Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease
