* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 separately causes delayed heading date and increased yield
    + Both OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 are expressed in rhythmic pattern, and their proteins are localized in the nucleus
    + Further analysis revealed that OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 delayed heading date by down-regulating the expression of the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 through key regulator of heading date Ehd1
    + OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 are two class II type LBD proteins, function as transcriptional activators
