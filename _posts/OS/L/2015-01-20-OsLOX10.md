* **Key message**  
    + In this study, the lipoxygenase OsLOX10 gene from the 9-lipoxygenase metabolic pathway was cloned from rice, and its roles in determining seed longevity and tolerance to saline-alkaline stress caused by Na(2)CO(3) in rice seedlings were mainly investigated

    + CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of OsLOX10 increased seed longevity compared with the wild-type and OsLOX10 overexpression lines in response to artificial aging
