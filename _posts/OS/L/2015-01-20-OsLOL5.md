* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsLOL5 grew well in the presence ofboth NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments, whereas wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth phenotype, and even death
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsLOL5 exhibited stronger resistance than NT under NaHCO3 treatment, as demonstrated by its greater shoot length, and fresh weight
    + These findings illustrated that OsLOL5 overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for SA stress through active oxygen species
    + A rice LSD1-like-type ZFP gene OsLOL5 enhances saline-alkaline tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast and rice.
    + The present study further revealed that OsLOL5 ZFP could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains
    + The results suggested that OsLOL5 improved SA tolerance in plants, and regulated oxidative and salinity stress retardation via the active oxygen detoxification pathway
    + Overexpression of OsLOL5 in yeast resulted in SA tolerance at significant level
    + OsLOL5 was located in the nucleus as evidenced by the bombardment of onion epidermal cells
