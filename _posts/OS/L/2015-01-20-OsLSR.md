* **Key message**  
    + ) NB-LRR gene via an insertion mutation, this mutant confesses a low seed setting phenotype and the corresponding genetic locus was named OsLSR (Low seed setting related)
    + Comparing with wildtype plant, both overexpression and suppression of OsLSR lead to the autoactivation of the rice immune system and accumulation of thiamine, which result in a great fitness cost and yield penalty
