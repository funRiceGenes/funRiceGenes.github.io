* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity
    + We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination
