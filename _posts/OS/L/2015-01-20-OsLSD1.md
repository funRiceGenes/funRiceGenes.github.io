* **Key message**  
    + OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation
    + Overexpression of OsLSD1 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter accelerated callus differentiation in transformed rice tissues and increased chlorophyll b content in transgenic rice plants

* **Connection**  
    + __OsLSD1__, __OsLSD3__, [Stress-Responsive Expression, Subcellular Localization and Protein-Protein Interactions of the Rice Metacaspase Family.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Stress-Responsive Expression, Subcellular Localization and Protein-Protein Interactions of the Rice Metacaspase Family.%5BTitle%5D), OsMC1 interacted with OsLSD1 and OsLSD3 while OsMC3 only interacted with OsLSD1 and that the zinc finger domain in OsMC1 is responsible for the interaction activity
