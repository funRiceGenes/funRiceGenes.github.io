* **Key message**  
    + Lectin receptor kinase OsLecRK-S.7 is required for pollen development and male fertility.
    + Rice OsLecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during pollen development.
    + Moreover, normal anther development requires the K-phosphorylation site (a conserved residue at the ATP-binding site) of OsLecRK5
    + In vitro assay showed that OsLecRK5 phosphorylates the callose synthesis enzyme UGP1, enhancing callose biosynthesis during anther development
    + OsLecRK5 encodes a plasma membrane (PM)-localized lectin receptor like kinase, which can form dimer with itself
