* **Key message**  
    + Previous reports showed that grain from the rice variety DawDam in which the LOX3 gene was deleted had less stale flavour after grain storage than normal rice
    + The suppression of LOX3 expression in rice endosperm increased grain storability
    + To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that decreased LOX3 expression can preserve rice grain quality during storage with no impact on grain yield, suggesting potential applications in agricultural production
    + Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity.
    + The molecular mechanism by which LOX3 expression is regulated during endosperm development remains unclear
    + ) plants to down-regulate LOX3 expression in rice endosperm
    + Further molecular and protein level experiments verified LOX3 deficiency and demonstrated the improvement of seed storability
    + Our work provides a flexible genome editing tool for improving important agronomic traits, as well as direct evidence that Lox3 has only a limited impact on seed longevity
    + TALEN-Based Mutagenesis of Lipoxygenase LOX3 Enhances the Storage Tolerance of Rice (Oryza sativa) Seeds.
