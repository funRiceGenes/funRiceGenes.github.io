* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, OsLMP1 epigenetically modifies SA synthetic pathway genes by deubiquitinating H(2)B and regulates the immune response in rice
    + In summary, this study deepens our understanding of the function of OsLMP1 in the plant immune response and provides further insight into the relationship between plants and pathogenic microorganisms
