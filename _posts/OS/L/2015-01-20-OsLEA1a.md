* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptome analysis revealed OsLEA1a mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues
    + Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA1a was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period
    + Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.
    + The accumulation of the TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein or OsLEA1a protein interfered with the resistance of E
    + The findings suggested that the OsLEA1a may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses
    + However, in the present study, based on growth status and physiological indices of rice plant, the overexpression of OsLEA1a in rice conferred increased resistance to abiotic stresses compared with the wild-type (WT) plants
    + Our previous studies have shown that the heterologous expression of OsLEA1a interfered with the resistance of Escherichia coli to abiotic stresses
    + OsLEA1a overexpression enhances tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses by inhibiting cell membrane damage and enhancing ROS scavenging capacity in transgenic rice
    + The present study shows that OsLEA1a could be a useful candidate gene for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in cultivated plants
    + The results indicate that the OsLEA1a gene is involved in the protective response of plants to various abiotic stresses by inhibiting cell membrane damage and enhancing reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity
