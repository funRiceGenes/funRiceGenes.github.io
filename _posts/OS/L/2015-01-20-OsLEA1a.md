* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptome analysis revealed OsLEA1a mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues
    + Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA1a was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period
    + Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.
    + The accumulation of the TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein or OsLEA1a protein interfered with the resistance of E
    + The findings suggested that the OsLEA1a may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses
