* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, OsLMP1 epigenetically modifies SA synthetic pathway genes by deubiquitinating H(2)B and regulates the immune response in rice
    + In summary, this study deepens our understanding of the function of OsLMP1 in the plant immune response and provides further insight into the relationship between plants and pathogenic microorganisms
    + The mutation of OsUBP2 was shown to result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, chloroplast structural defects, and programmed cell death, while the overexpression of OsUBP2 weakened rice resistance to leaf blast
    + LMM22 interacts with SPOTTED LEAF 35 (SPL35), a coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation domain-containing protein that is known to participate in ubiquitination and the regulation of cell death and disease response in rice
    + These data therefore improve our understanding of the function of UBP in rice innate immune responses by demonstrating that LMM22 functions as a critical regulator of SPL35 in cell death and disease resistance
    + Both dysfunction and overexpression of LMM22 gave rise to the hypersensitive response-like cell death, reactive oxygen species bursts, and activated defence responses
    + Here, we identified a rice lesion mimic mutant (LMM) and cloned its causative gene, LMM22
