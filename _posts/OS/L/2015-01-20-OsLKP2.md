* **Key message**  
    + Under drought conditions, total wax loads on the leaf surface increased by approximately 10% in oslkp2-1 and oslkp2-2 compared to the wild type, and the transcript levels of cuticular wax biosynthesis genes were upregulated in the oslkp2 mutants
    + OsLKP2 knockdown (oslkp2-1) and knockout (oslkp2-2) mutants exhibited enhanced drought tolerance
    + Among ZEITLUPE family genes, OsLKP2 expression specifically increased under dehydration stress
    + Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsLKP2 interacts with GIGANTEA (OsGI) in the nucleus
