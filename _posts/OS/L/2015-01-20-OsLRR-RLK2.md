* **Key message**  
    + Silencing OsLRR-RLK2 decreases the constitutive activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK6) and alters BPH-induced transcript levels of several defense-related WRKY transcription factors
    + Moreover, silencing OsLRR-RLK2 reduces BPH-induction of jasmonic acid and ethylene but promotes the biosynthesis of both elicited salicylic acid and H2 O2 ; silencing also enhances  the production of volatiles emitted from rice plants infested with gravid BPH females
