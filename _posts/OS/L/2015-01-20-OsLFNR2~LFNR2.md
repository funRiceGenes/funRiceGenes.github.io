## Key message
1. __growth__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice Oryza sativa full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis Arabidopsis thaliana and rice
2. __leaf__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice Oryza sativa full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis Arabidopsis thaliana and rice

3. __OsLFNR1~LFNR1__, __OsLFNR2~LFNR2__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions
