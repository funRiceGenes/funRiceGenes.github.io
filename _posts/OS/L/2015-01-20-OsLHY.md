* **Key message**  
    + OsCCA1 also regulates IPA1 expression to mediate panicle and grain development
    + Downregulating and overexpressing OsCCA1 increases and reduces tiller numbers, respectively, whereas manipulating PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (OsPPR1) expression results in the opposite effects
    + Genetic analyses using double mutants and overexpression in the mutants show that OsTB1, D14, and IPA1 act downstream of OsCCA1 Sugars repress OsCCA1 expression in roots and tiller buds to promote tiller-bud outgrowth
    + Additionally, the dual function of OsLHY entirely relied on Hd1, as the double mutant oslhy hd1 showed the same heading date with hd1 under about 11
    + Dual function of clock component OsLHY sets critical day length for photoperiodic flowering in rice
    + By MutMap technique, we identified the candidate gene OsLHY from a later flowering mutant lem1 and further confirmed it through genetic complementation, RNA interference knockdown, and CRISPR/Cas9-knockout
