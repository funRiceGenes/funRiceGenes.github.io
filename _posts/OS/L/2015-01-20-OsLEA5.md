* **Key message**  
    + The expression levels of OsLEA5 in the roots and panicles of full ripe stage were dramatically increased
    + coli cells producing OsLEA5 fusion protein exhibited improved resistance against diverse abiotic stresses: high salinity, osmotic, freezing, heat, and UV radiation
    + The OsLEA5 protein confers stabilization of the LDH under different abiotic stresses, such as heating, freeze-thawing, and drying in vitro
    + The combined results indicated that OsLEA5 protein was a hydrophobic atypical LEA and closely associated with resistance to multiple abiotic stresses
    + Molecular characterization and functional analysis by heterologous expression in E. coli under diverse abiotic stresses for OsLEA5, the atypical hydrophobic LEA protein from Oryza sativa L
