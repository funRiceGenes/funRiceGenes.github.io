* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of transcription factor OsLFL1 delays flowering time in Oryza sativa
    + In this study, it was found that the flowering promoting gene Ehd1 and its putative downstream genes were all repressed by OsLFL1
    + In the mutant W378, the mutant gene coding OsLFL1, a putative B3 transcription factor gene, was ectopically expressed
    + Furthermore, GD1 binds to the promoter of OsLFL1, a LEC2/FUS3-like gene of rice, via an RY element, leading to significant up-regulation of OsLFL1 and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the gd1 mutant
    + As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
    + Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1
    + OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice
    + These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
    + Introduction of OsLFL1-RNAi into mutant W378 successfully down-regulated OsLFL1 expression and restored flowering to almost normal time, indicating that overexpression of OsLFL1 confers late flowering for mutant W378
    + Thus, overexpression of OsLFL1 might delay the flowering of W378 by repressing the expression of Ehd1
