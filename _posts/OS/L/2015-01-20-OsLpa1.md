## Key message
1. __phosphate__, [The rice OsLpa1 gene encodes a novel protein involved in phytic acid metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsLpa1 gene encodes a novel protein involved in phytic acid metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  The proteins encoded by OsLpa1 do not have homology to any of the inositol phosphate metabolism genes recently characterized in plants, although there is homology to 2-phosphoglycerate kinase, an enzyme found in hyperthermophilic methanogens that catalyzes the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate from 2-phosphoglycerate
