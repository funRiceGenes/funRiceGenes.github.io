* **Key message**  
    + Overall, the data in this study provide an advanced understanding of the function of OsLACS9 and its role in starch degradation and plant growth
    + Our results indicate that the loss-of-function mutations in OsLACS9 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants with large starch granules in the chloroplast, showing the suppression of starch degradation
