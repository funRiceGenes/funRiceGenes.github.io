* **Key message**  
    + Oxidative damage also decreased, and plant growth increased in all oslcd single mutant seedlings as compared to WTs in the presence of Cd
    + Plant growth and most yield traits, as well essential element concentrations in rice seedling shoots, brown rice, and rice straw, were similar between oslcd single mutants and WTs
    + However, the effects of OsLCD gene editing on Cd accumulation, plant growth, and yield traits remain unknown
    + The OsLCD gene, which has been implicated in cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice, might be a useful target for CRISPR/Cas9 editing

    + __OsLCD__, __OsNRAMP5__, [Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.%5BTitle%5D),  We also generated osnramp5 single mutants and oslcd osnramp5 double mutants in the indica background
    + __OsLCD__, __OsNRAMP5__, [Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.%5BTitle%5D),  In the presence of Cd, Cd concentrations in the brown rice and shoots of oslcd osnramp5 double mutants were significantly decreased compared with WTs as well as osnramp single mutants
    + __OsLCD__, __OsNRAMP5__, [Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Generation of low-cadmium rice germplasms via knockout of OsLCD using CRISPR/Cas9.%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggested that OsLCD knockout may reduce Cd accumulation alone or in combination with other knockout mutations in a variety of rice genotypes; unlike OsNramp5 mutations, OsLCD knockout did not reduce essential element contents
