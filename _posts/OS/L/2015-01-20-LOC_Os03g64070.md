* **Key message**  
    + Conversely, mutations at the 3'-end of OsLOGL5 CDS resulted in normal rice plant morphology but with increased grain yield under well-watered, drought, normal nitrogen, and low nitrogen field conditions at multiple geographical locations
    + All OsLOGL5-edited plants significantly increased seed setting rate, total grain numbers, full-filled grain numbers per panicle, and thousand seed weight under drought conditions, suggesting that OsLOGL5 is likely involved in the regulation of both seed development and grain filling processes
    + Our results indicate that the C-terminal end of OsLOGL5 protein plays an important role in regulating rice yield improvement under different abiotic stress conditions, and OsLOGL5 is important for rice yield enhancement and stability
