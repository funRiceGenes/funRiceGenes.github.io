* **Key message**  
    + Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions
    + Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C
    + In this report, a LEA protein gene OsLEA3-1 was identified and over-expressed in rice to test the drought resistance of transgenic lines under the field conditions
    + These results indicate that transgenic rice with significantly enhanced drought resistance and without yield penalty can be generated by over-expressing OsLEA3-1 gene with appropriate promoters and following a bipartite (stress and non-stress) in-field screening protocol
    + Drought resistance pre-screening of T(1) families at anthesis stage revealed that the over-expressing families with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs had significantly higher relative yield (yield under drought stress treatment/yield under normal growth conditions) than the wild type under drought stress conditions, although a yield penalty existed in T(1) families under normal growth conditions
    + OsLEA3-1 is induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold stress
    + The promoter of OsLEA3-1 isolated from the upland rice IRAT109 exhibits strong activity under drought- and salt-stress conditions
    + Three expression constructs consisting of the full-length cDNA driven by the drought-inducible promoter of OsLEA3-1 (OsLEA3-H), the CaMV 35S promoter (OsLEA3-S), and the rice Actin1 promoter (OsLEA3-A) were transformed into the drought-sensitive japonica rice Zhonghua 11
    + Exogenous application of ABA and exposure to salt shock (150 mM NaCl) rapidly induces a de novo, abundant oslea3 transcript accumulation in seedling roots, whereas application of jasmonic acid (9 microM) does not induce oslea3 expression
    + The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress
    + Except for two families (transformed with OsLEA3-A), all the other families (transformed with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs) had higher grain yield than the wild type under drought stress in both the field and the PVC pipes conditions
    + The encoded OSLEA3 protein has previously been found to accumulate to higher levels in roots of two salt-tolerant compared to a salt-sensitive rice variety in response to abscisic acid (ABA) [Moons et al
    + The stress-induced oslea3 transcript gradually declined upon prolonged salt shock, as wilting-induced damage became irreversible
    + oslea3 expression was compared for the salt-tolerant variety Pokkali and the salt-sensitive cultivar Taichung N1
    + The results suggest that a differential regulation of oslea3 expression is an aspect of the varietal differences in salt stress tolerance
    + Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different
    + A cDNA clone oslea3, encoding a group 3 late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein was isolated from roots of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines

    + __OsLEA3~OsLEA3-1__, __OsNAC3__, [A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21
    + __OsHB22__, __OsLEA3~OsLEA3-1__, [The OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module regulates drought response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module regulates drought response in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The OsFTIP6-mediated OsHB22 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and OsMYBR57-OsHB22 regulation of OsbZIP transcription ensure precise control of expression of OsLEA3 and Rab21, and thereby regulate the response to water deficiency in rice
    + __OsbHLH96~OsbHLH044__, __OsLEA3~OsLEA3-1__, [Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, the expression of ion homeostasis-related genes (OsHKTs, OsHAK, OsSOSs, and OsNHX) and ABA-responsive gene (OsLEA3) was significantly altered in the osbhlh044 mutants after salt stress
    + __OsbHLH96~OsbHLH044__, __OsLEA3~OsLEA3-1__, [Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters
