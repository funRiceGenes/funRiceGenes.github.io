* **Key message**  
    + Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions
    + Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C
    + In this report, a LEA protein gene OsLEA3-1 was identified and over-expressed in rice to test the drought resistance of transgenic lines under the field conditions
    + These results indicate that transgenic rice with significantly enhanced drought resistance and without yield penalty can be generated by over-expressing OsLEA3-1 gene with appropriate promoters and following a bipartite (stress and non-stress) in-field screening protocol
    + Drought resistance pre-screening of T(1) families at anthesis stage revealed that the over-expressing families with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs had significantly higher relative yield (yield under drought stress treatment/yield under normal growth conditions) than the wild type under drought stress conditions, although a yield penalty existed in T(1) families under normal growth conditions
    + OsLEA3-1 is induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold stress
    + The promoter of OsLEA3-1 isolated from the upland rice IRAT109 exhibits strong activity under drought- and salt-stress conditions
    + Three expression constructs consisting of the full-length cDNA driven by the drought-inducible promoter of OsLEA3-1 (OsLEA3-H), the CaMV 35S promoter (OsLEA3-S), and the rice Actin1 promoter (OsLEA3-A) were transformed into the drought-sensitive japonica rice Zhonghua 11
    + Exogenous application of ABA and exposure to salt shock (150 mM NaCl) rapidly induces a de novo, abundant oslea3 transcript accumulation in seedling roots, whereas application of jasmonic acid (9 microM) does not induce oslea3 expression
    + The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress
    + Except for two families (transformed with OsLEA3-A), all the other families (transformed with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs) had higher grain yield than the wild type under drought stress in both the field and the PVC pipes conditions
    + The encoded OSLEA3 protein has previously been found to accumulate to higher levels in roots of two salt-tolerant compared to a salt-sensitive rice variety in response to abscisic acid (ABA) [Moons et al
    + The stress-induced oslea3 transcript gradually declined upon prolonged salt shock, as wilting-induced damage became irreversible
    + oslea3 expression was compared for the salt-tolerant variety Pokkali and the salt-sensitive cultivar Taichung N1
    + The results suggest that a differential regulation of oslea3 expression is an aspect of the varietal differences in salt stress tolerance
    + Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different
    + A cDNA clone oslea3, encoding a group 3 late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein was isolated from roots of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
