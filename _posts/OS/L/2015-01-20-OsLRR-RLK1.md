* **Key message**  
    + OsLRR-RLK1 acts upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades, and positively regulates defense-related MPKs and WRKY transcription factors
    + Moreover, OsLRR-RLK1 is a positive regulator of SSB-elicited, but not wound-elicited, levels of jasmonic acid and ethylene, trypsin protease inhibitor activity and plant resistance towards SSB
    + Screening of early signaling components reveals that indole pre-exposure directly enhances the expression of the receptor like kinase OsLRR-RLK1
