## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study, we identified OsLTPL36, a homolog of putative lipid transport protein, and showed specific expression in rice developing seed |  Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants |  Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT)  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT) |  Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines
