## Key message
1. __grain yield__, [Overexpression of microRNA OsmiR397 improves rice yield by increasing grain size and promoting panicle branching](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of microRNA OsmiR397 improves rice yield by increasing grain size and promoting panicle branching%5BTitle%5D),  We determined that OsmiR397 increases grain yield by downregulating its target, OsLAC, whose product is a laccase-like protein that we found to be involved in the sensitivity of plants to brassinosteroids
