* **Key message**  
    + qRT-PCR and promoter-GUS reporter analyses indicated that under Pi-sufficient conditions OsLPR5 was highly expressed in the roots, and specific expression occurred in the leaf collars and nodes, and its expression was increased under Pi-deficient conditions
    + Overexpression of OsLPR5 triggered higher ferroxidase activity, and elevated concentrations of Fe(III) in the xylem sap and of total Fe in the roots and shoots
    + Knockout mutation in OsLPR5 by means of CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in adverse effects on Pi translocation, on the relative expression of Cis-NATOsPHO1;2, and on several morphological traits, including root development and yield potential
    + Our results indicate that ferroxidase-dependent OsLPR5 has both a broad-spectrum influence on growth and development in rice as well as affecting a subset of physiological and molecular traits that govern Pi homeostasis
    + Transient expression of OsLPR5 in Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence of its subcellular localization to the cell wall and endoplasmic reticulum
