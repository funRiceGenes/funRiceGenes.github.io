* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsLTPL36 was exclusively expressed in developing seed coat and endosperm aleurone cells
    + Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants
    + Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines
    + Histological analysis showed that the embryo development was delayed after down regulation of OsLTPL36
    + Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT)

    + __OsCR4~MIS2__, __OsLTPL36~OsCIP1__, [OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCIP1, a secreted protein, binds to and stabilizes OsCR4 to promote aleurone layer development, seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  oscip1, in which OsCR4 protein was decreased, exhibited thinner aleurone layer, late germination and delayed growth; while OsCIP1-overexpressing plants, in which OsCR4 protein was increased, displayed enhanced growth at the early seedling stage
