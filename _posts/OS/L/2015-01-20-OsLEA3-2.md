* **Key message**  
    + OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance
    + The coding protein localizes to the nucleus and overexpression of OsLEA3-2 in yeast improved growth performance compared with control under salt- and osmotic-stress conditions
    + OsLEA3-2 was found to be only expressed in the embryo and can be induced by abiotic stresses
    + These results indicated that OsLEA3-2 plays an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses
