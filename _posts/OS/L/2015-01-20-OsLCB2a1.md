* **Key message**  
    + Transcripts of OsLCB2a1 gene in rice seedlings were increased at 4 h, but decreased at 8-24 h after BPH attack
    + Herein we report that a rice LCB gene, OsLCB2a1 encoding a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a key enzyme responsible for the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids, plays a critical role in plant defense response to the brown planthopper (BPH) attack and that its up-regulation protects plants from herbivore infestation

    + Our data highlight the key functions of OsLCB2a1 in biotic stress response in plants
