* **Key message**  
    + In transgenic rice, the knock-down of either OsPT2 or OsPT6 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased both the uptake and the long-distance transport of Pi from roots to shoots
    + Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters
    + A putative high-affinity phosphate (Pi) transporter gene in rice (Oryza sativa), OsLPT1, was isolated by RT-PCR from the leaves of the plants
    + The 1635-bp nucleotide sequence of OsLPT1 spans an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 535 amino acids with sequence similarity to phosphate transporters from other plant species
    + The expression of OsLPT1 in the roots was enhanced by Pi deprivation
    + The data suggests that the OsLPT1 protein may be involved in enhancing phosphate uptake under conditions of Pi starvation, and in the translocation of Pi among cells in shoots to increase the efficiency of internal Pi use
    + Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
    + In situ hybridization revealed OsLPT1 expression in mesophyll cells, xylem parenchyma and phloem cells in the leaves, and in the epidermis, exodermis, and in the vasculature surrounding metaxylem vessels in the roots
    + Taken together, these data suggest OsPT6 plays a broad role in Pi uptake and translocation throughout the plant, whereas OsPT2 is a low-affinity Pi transporter, and functions in translocation of the stored Pi in the plant
    + In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8
    + RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the expression of OsLPT1 in both leaves and roots
    + Two rice phosphate transporters, OsPht1;2 and OsPht1;6, have different functions and kinetic properties in uptake and translocation
    + By using transgenic rice plants expressing the GUS reporter gene, driven by their promoters, we detected that OsPT2 was localized exclusively in the stele of primary and lateral roots, whereas OsPT6 was expressed in both epidermal and cortical cells of the younger primary and lateral roots
    + OsPT6, but not OsPT2, was able to complement a yeast Pi uptake mutant in the high-affinity concentration range
