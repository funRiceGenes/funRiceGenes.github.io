* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, OsLMP1 epigenetically modifies SA synthetic pathway genes by deubiquitinating H(2)B and regulates the immune response in rice
    + In summary, this study deepens our understanding of the function of OsLMP1 in the plant immune response and provides further insight into the relationship between plants and pathogenic microorganisms
    + The mutation of OsUBP2 was shown to result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, chloroplast structural defects, and programmed cell death, while the overexpression of OsUBP2 weakened rice resistance to leaf blast
