## Expression information

## Key message
1. __domestication__, [Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Association analysis indicates that a single-nucleotide polymorphism-6 in the OsLG1 regulatory region led to a compact panicle architecture in cultivars during rice domestication
2. __meristem__, [Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic plants harboring the OsLG1 promoter:GUS beta-glucuronidase reporter gene construct display preferential expression in developing laminar joint regions and meristemic regions
3. __panicle__, [Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development
4. __panicle__, [Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Association analysis indicates that a single-nucleotide polymorphism-6 in the OsLG1 regulatory region led to a compact panicle architecture in cultivars during rice domestication
5. __panicle architecture__, [Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development

7. __architecture__, [Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development

9. __leaf__, [Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint%5BTitle%5D),  These results indicate that OsLG1 is a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in building the laminar joint between leaf blade and leaf sheath boundary, thereby controlling ligule and auricle development
10. __transcription factor__, [Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development
11. __panicle__, [OsLG1 regulates a closed panicle trait in domesticated rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsLG1 regulates a closed panicle trait in domesticated rice%5BTitle%5D), OsLG1 regulates a closed panicle trait in domesticated rice
12. __sheath__, [Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint%5BTitle%5D),  These results indicate that OsLG1 is a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in building the laminar joint between leaf blade and leaf sheath boundary, thereby controlling ligule and auricle development
