* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
    + The OsLTP5 transcript was expressed prominently in stems and flowers, but was barely detectable in leaves
    + Treatment with the cutin monomer 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (HPA), a major component of cutin, elicited the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rice leaves and induced the expression of the lipid transfer protein gene OsLTP5
    + Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene
