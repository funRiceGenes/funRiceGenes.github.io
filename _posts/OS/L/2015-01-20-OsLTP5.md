## Key message
1. __ ABA __, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
2. __stem__, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsLTP5 transcript was expressed prominently in stems and flowers, but was barely detectable in leaves
3. __cutin__, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)), Treatment with the cutin monomer 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (HPA), a major component of cutin, elicited the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rice leaves and induced the expression of the lipid transfer protein gene OsLTP5
4. __cutin__, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)), Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene
5. __shoot__, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
6. __salicylic acid__, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid
7. __flower__, [Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsLTP5 transcript was expressed prominently in stems and flowers, but was barely detectable in leaves
