* **Key message**  
    + Identification and expression analysis of OsLPR family revealed the potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.
    + The results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of OsLPR family with potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice
    + Pi deficiency (-P) triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5
    + OsLPR3 was found to be induced in the leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots under Pi deprivation
    + OsLPR3 overexpression strongly inhibited the growth and development of the rice but did not affect the Pi homeostasis of the plant
    + The agronomic traits of the oslpr3 mutants, such as 1000-grain weight and seed length, were stimulated under Pi-sufficient conditions, indicating that OsLPR3 plays roles different from those of OsLPR5 during plant growth and development, as well as in the maintenance of the Pi status of rice
    + However, oslpr3 mutants improved RSA and Pi utilization, and they exhibited a higher tolerance to low Pi stress in rice
    + Mutation of OsLPR3 Enhances Tolerance to Phosphate Starvation in Rice.
