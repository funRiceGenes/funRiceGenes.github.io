* **Key message**  
    + Both the OsFIE2 and OsEZ11 genes are strongly expressed in leaf and stem compared to other tissues, including root, anther, ovary, and ovule
    + Involvement of rice Polycomb protein OsFIE2 in plant growth and seed size
    + Our results suggest that OsFIE2-polycomb complex positively regulates rice endosperm development and grain filling via a mechanism highly different from that in Arabidopsis
    + Genetic studies showed that a reduction of OsFIE2 expression led to smaller seeds, partially filled seeds, and partial loss of seed dormancy
    + Polycomb group gene OsFIE2 regulates rice (Oryza sativa) seed development and grain filling via a mechanism distinct from Arabidopsis
    + The H3K27me3 modification and gene expression in a key helix-loop-helix transcription factor is shown to be regulated by OsFIE2
    + Importantly, they produced bigger seed than the wild type, indicating that OsFIE2 may play an important role in seed size
    + Gene expression and proteomics analyses found that the starch synthesis rate limiting step enzyme and multiple storage proteins are down-regulated in OsFIE2 reduction lines
    + We further examined whether OsFIE2 interacted with OsEZ1 using a yeast two-hybrid system
    + In this study, the function of the rice fertilization-independent endosperm gene OsFIE2, which expresses a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis Polycomb protein FIE, was characterized
    + Polycomb Protein OsFIE2 Affects Plant Height and Grain Yield in Rice.
    + Taken together, these results indicate that OsFIE2 plays an important role in the regulation of plant height and grain yield in rice
    + OsFIE2 is expressed in most tissues and the coded protein localizes in both nucleus and cytoplasm
    + The CRISPR/Cas9-derived mutant osfie2 exhibited impaired cellularization of the endosperm, which suggested that OsFIE2 is indispensable for early seed development as a positive regulator of cellularization
