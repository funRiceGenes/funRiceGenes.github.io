## Connection
1. __OsF5HL__, __OsF5HL2__, [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  We have isolated twoF5H genes,OsF5HL andOsF5HL2, from a japonica-type rice (Oryza sativa L
2. __OsF5HL__, __OsF5HL2__, [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  Alignments of theOsF5HL andOsF5HL2 cDNAs to their genomic DNAs revealed thatOsF5HL has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1590 b from four exons, whileOsF5HL2 has an ORF of 1560 b from two exons
3. __OsF5HL__, __OsF5HL2__, [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression ofOsFSHL is highest in young leaves, whereas that ofOsF5HL2 is greatest in mature leaves
4. __OsF5HL__, __OsF5HL2__, [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  These data suggest that theOsF5HL andOsF5HL2 genes belong to theCYP84 subfamily and that their expressions are tissue-specific
