2. __temperature__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicated that OsFAD2 is involved in fatty acid desaturation and maintenance of the membrane lipids balance in cells, and could improve the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress"
3. __cold tolerance__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)), " Heterologous expression of OsFAD2 enhanced the yeast cells cold tolerance capacity compared to wild-type yeast
4. __cold tolerance__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  More importantly, the 35S::OsFAD2 plants showed significantly enhanced cold tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 46% over controls in the greenhouse under cold conditions"
