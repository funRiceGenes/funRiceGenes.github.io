* **Key message**  
    + OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 interacted in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cell and cross-regulated the expression of each other
    + OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.

    + __FKF1~OsFKF1__, __OsFBO10__, [OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Novel interactions were confirmed between OsCRY2 and members of ZEITLUPE family of blue/ultraviolet-A light photoreceptors, encoded by OsFBO8, OsFBO9 and OsFBO10 which are orthologous to ZEITLUPE (ZTL), LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) and FLAVIN BINDING, KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1), respectively, of Arabidopsis thaliana
    + __FKF1~OsFKF1__, __OsFBO10__, [OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Since FKF1 is known to play a role in regulating photoperiodic flowering, OsFBO10 was chosen for further studies
    + __OsCRY2~CRY2__, __OsFBO10__, [OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.%5BTitle%5D), OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.

    + __OsCRY2~CRY2__, __OsFBO10__, [OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Both OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 played a positive role in photomorphogenic responses in different light conditions
    + __OsCRY2~CRY2__, __OsFBO10__, [OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCRY2 and OsFBO10 co-regulate photomorphogenesis and photoperiodic flowering in indica rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The physical interaction of OsCRY2 with OsFBO10, their involvement in common physiological and developmental pathways and their cross-regulation of each other suggest that the two photoreceptors may regulate common developmental pathways in plants, either jointly or redundantly
