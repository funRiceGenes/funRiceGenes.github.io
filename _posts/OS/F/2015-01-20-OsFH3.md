* **Key message**  
    + osfh3 osfh5 mutants were dwarf with more severe developmental defectiveness
    + Furthermore, its N-terminal phosphatase and tensin homolog domain played a key role in modulating OsFH3 localization at intersections of AF and punctate structures of microtubules, which differed from other reported plant formins
