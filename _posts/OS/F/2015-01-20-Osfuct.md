* **Key message**  
    + We characterized an Osfuct mutant that displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, such as impaired anther and pollen development, diminished growth, shorter plant height, fewer tillers, and shorter panicle length and internodes under field conditions

* **Connection**  
    + __Osfuct__, __OsXylT~RCN11__, [Inactivation of the β 1, 2-xylosyltransferase and the α 1, 3-fucosyltransferase gene in rice Oryza sativa by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inactivation of the β 1, 2-xylosyltransferase and the α 1, 3-fucosyltransferase gene in rice Oryza sativa by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy%5BTitle%5D), CRISPR/Cas9-mediated OsXylT and OsFucT mutation caused the elimination of plant-specific β1,2-xylose and α1,3-fucose residues on glycoproteins in rice, which is the first report of OsXylT/OsFucT double KO mutation in rice
    + __Osfuct__, __OsXylT~RCN11__, [Inactivation of the β 1, 2-xylosyltransferase and the α 1, 3-fucosyltransferase gene in rice Oryza sativa by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inactivation of the β 1, 2-xylosyltransferase and the α 1, 3-fucosyltransferase gene in rice Oryza sativa by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy%5BTitle%5D),  As an effort to use plants as a platform to produce biopharmaceuticals, the plant-specific N-glycan genes of rice (Oryza sativa), β1,2-xylT (OsXylT) and α1,3-FucT (OsFucT), were knocked out using multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 technology
    + __Osfuct__, __OsXylT~RCN11__, [Inactivation of the β 1, 2-xylosyltransferase and the α 1, 3-fucosyltransferase gene in rice Oryza sativa by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inactivation of the β 1, 2-xylosyltransferase and the α 1, 3-fucosyltransferase gene in rice Oryza sativa by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, we suggest that each enzymes working on the process for complex N-glycan biosynthesis might independently act in rice, hence the double knock-out of both OsXylT and OsFucT might be not enough to humanize N-glycan structure in rice
