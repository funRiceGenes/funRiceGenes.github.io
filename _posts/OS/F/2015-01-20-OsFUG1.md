* **Key message**  
    + Data suggests a role for OsFUG1 in seed-related stages that influence panicle architecture and fertility
    + Although the differences are not statistically significant, both OsELS1 and OsFUG1 KO lines showed decreased internode elongation compared to the respective controls
    + OsFUG1 KO also significantly impacts development and fertility
