* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing OsFRO1 were more sensitive to Fe toxicity, in contrast RNA interference lines showed more tolerance to Fe excess stress
    + Together these data show that OsFRO1 is involved in reducing ferric Fe into ferrous Fe in the vacuole, and makes the vacuolar stored Fe available to the cytoplasm through Fe (II) or chelated Fe (II) transporters
    + This indicates that OsFRO1 plays an important role to maintain Fe homeostasis between the cytoplasm and vacuole in rice
