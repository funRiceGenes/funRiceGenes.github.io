* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The expression level of OsFTL10 was high in young seedlings and shown to be induced by GA3 and drought stress
    + Overexpression of OsFTL10 induces early flowering and improves drought tolerance in Oryza sativa L.
    + Further experiments revealed that constitutive expression of OsFTL10 improved the drought tolerance of transgenic plants by stimulating the expression of drought responsive genes
    + The OsFTL10 protein was also detected in both nucleus and cytoplasm
