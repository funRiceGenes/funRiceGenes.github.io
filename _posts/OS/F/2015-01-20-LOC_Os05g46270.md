* **Key message**  
    + In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves
    + OsFEN-1 transcripts were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
    + Our results indicate that OsFEN-1 is expressed in tissues rich in proliferating cells, and its expression may be required for cell growth and organ formation
