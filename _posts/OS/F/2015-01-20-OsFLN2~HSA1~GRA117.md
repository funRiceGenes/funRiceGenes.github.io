* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning revealed that HSA1 encodes a putative OsFLN2
    + The hsa1 mutant harbors a recessive mutation in a gene encoding fructokinase-like protein2 (FLN2); the mutation causes a premature stop codon and results in a severe albino phenotype, with defects in early chloroplast development
    + The color of hsa1 mutant plants gradually changed from albino to green at later stages of development at various temperatures and chloroplast biogenesis was strongly delayed at high temperature (32<U+202F><a1><e3>C)
    + HSA1 localizes to the chloroplast and regulates chloroplast development
    + These results demonstrated that HSA1 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early stages, and functions in protecting chloroplasts under heat stress at later stages in rice
    + GRA117 encodes PfkB-type fructokinase-like 2, which is subcellularly localized in chloroplasts and is widely expressed in various rice tissues, particularly at high levels in leaf tissues
    + RNA-Seq analysis revealed that GRA117 plays a significant role in photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon metabolism, and chloroplast ribosome-related pathways
    + Our study supports that GRA117 promotes the Calvin-Benson cycle by regulating chloroplast development, ultimately leading to enhanced carbon assimilation in rice
    + GRA117 is crucial in the process of carbon assimilation in rice as it regulates the development of chloroplasts, which in turn facilitates the Calvin-Benson cycle
