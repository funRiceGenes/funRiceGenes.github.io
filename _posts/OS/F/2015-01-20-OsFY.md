## Connection
1. __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis
2. __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA

5. __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots
