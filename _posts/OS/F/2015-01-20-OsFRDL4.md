## Key message
1. __transporter__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
2. __xylem__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap
3. __Al tolerance__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
4. __Al tolerance__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap
5. __Al tolerance__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between OsFRDL4 expression level and the amount of citrate secretion in rice cultivars that are differing in Al tolerance
6. __Al tolerance__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
7. __root__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression level of the OsFRDL4 gene in roots was very low in the absence of Al, but was greatly enhanced by Al after short exposure
8. __root__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL4 was localized in all cells in the root tip
9. __root__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
10. __transcription factor__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance

## Connection
1. __ART1__, __OsFRDL4__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
2. __OsFRDL2__, __OsFRDL4__, [Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  A double mutant between osfrdl2 and osfrdl4 or osfrdl1 did not further decrease the Al-induced citrate secretion and Fe translocation compared with the single mutant
