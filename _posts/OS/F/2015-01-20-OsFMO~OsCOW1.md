## Key message
1. __stem__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that oscow1 plants are water-deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio
2. __growth__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D),  Our results demonstrated that IAA biosynthesis regulated by OsFMOt is likely localized and might play an essential role in shaping local IAA concentrations which, in turn, is critical for regulating normal growth and development in rice
3. __leaf__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, the full-length genomic DNA and cDNA of OsFMOt), a FMO gene that was originally identified from a rolled-leaf mutant in rice, was isolated and cloned from wild type of the rolled-leaf mutant
4. __leaf__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D),  Spatio-temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR and histochemical analysis for GUS activity revealed that expression of OsFMOt was totally absent in the rolled-leaf mutant
5. __leaf__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D),  Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T-DNA-inserted allele of OsCOW1 exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios
6. __leaf__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D),  When oscow1 seedlings are grown under low-intensity light and high relative humidity, the rolled-leaf phenotype is greatly alleviated
7. __iaa__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of OsFMOt in transformed rice calli produced IAA-excessive phenotypes that showed browning and lethal effects when exogenous auxins such as naphthylacetic acid NAA were added to the medium
8. __iaa__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMOt in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggested that the OsFMOt protein is involved in IAA biosynthesis in rice and its overexpression could lead to the malformation of calli
