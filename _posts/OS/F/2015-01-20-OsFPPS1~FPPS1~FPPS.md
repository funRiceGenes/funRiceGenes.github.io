* **Key message**  
    + Immunocytochemical staining using anti-FPPS1 antibody followed by electron microscopy showed that FPPS1 was localized to chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells
    + FPPS was detected in the chloroplast fraction in wheat, and was protected from proteolysis following trypsin treatment of chloroplasts
    + FPPS was also detected in the chloroplast fraction of a dicot plant, tobacco
