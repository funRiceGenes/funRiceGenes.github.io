## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D),  Immunocytochemical staining using anti-FPPS1 antibody followed by electron microscopy showed that FPPS1 was localized to chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells
2. __chloroplast__, [Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D),  FPPS was detected in the chloroplast fraction in wheat, and was protected from proteolysis following trypsin treatment of chloroplasts
3. __chloroplast__, [Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D),  FPPS was also detected in the chloroplast fraction of a dicot plant, tobacco
4. __chloroplast__, [Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D),  Immunocytochemical staining using anti-FPPS1 antibody followed by electron microscopy showed that FPPS1 was localized to chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells
