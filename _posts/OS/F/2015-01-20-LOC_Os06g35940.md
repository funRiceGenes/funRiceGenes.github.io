* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that OsFTL12 plays an antagonistic function against Hd3a and RFT1 to modulate the heading date and plant architecture in rice
    + Unlike Hd3a and RFT1, OsFTL12 is not regulated by daylength and highly expressed in both SD and LD conditions, and delays the heading date under either SD or LD conditions
