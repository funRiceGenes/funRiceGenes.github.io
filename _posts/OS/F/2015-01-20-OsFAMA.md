* **Key message**  
    + OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation.
    + These results indicated that OsFAMA controlled the cell fate transition from GMCs to GCs and from SMCs to SCs and affected SMC asymmetrical division.
    + OsICE1 and OsICE2 interact with OsSPCH1, OsSPCH2, OsMUTE or OsFAMA to specify three cell fate transition steps during stomatal development
