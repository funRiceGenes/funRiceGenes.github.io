* **Key message**  
    + The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures
    + The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GmFAD3-1 and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0
    + Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than GmFAD3-1 in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds
    + Similar temperature responses of the OsFAD3 gene were observed both in chilling- tolerant and in chilling-intolerant rice cultivars
    + In root tissues, a high level of the OsFAD3 mRNA was observed at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with its level decreasing markedly at temperatures below 10 degrees C
    + Expression of the OsFAD3 cDNA in tobacco hairy root tissues and subsequent analysis of fatty acid compositions demonstrated the activity of the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase
    + The OsFAD3 mRNA was abundant in root tissues, but was hardly detectable in leaves

* **Connection**  
    + __OsFAD3__, __OsFAD7__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds
