* **Key message**  
    + Here, we investigated the role of OsFBT4 in abiotic stress signalling
    + Overexpression of OsFBT4 caused upregulation of several ABA-regulated/independent stress-responsive genes at more advanced stages of growth, showing wide and intricate roles played by OsFBT4 in stress signalling
    + The OsFBT4 transcript was strongly upregulated in response to different abiotic stresses in rice, including exogenous ABA
    + The OsFBT4 showed interaction with several OSKs (Oryza SKP1 proteins) and localized to the plasma membrane (PM)
