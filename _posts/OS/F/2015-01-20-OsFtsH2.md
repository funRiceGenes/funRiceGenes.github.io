* **Key message**  
    + OsFtsH2 transcriptional expression possibly played an important role in the regulation of D1 protein turnover and PSII repair cycle in relation to ABA mediated leaf senescence
    + The essential roles of OsFtsH2 in developing the chloroplast of rice.
    + OsFtsH2 was located in the chloroplast and preferentially expressed in green tissues
    + CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggested OsFtsH2 to be essential for chloroplast development in rice
    + RNA sequencing analysis indicated that many biological processes such as photosynthesis-related pathways and plant hormone signal transduction were significantly affected in osftsh2 mutants

    + __D1~RGA1~LW5__, __OsFtsH2__, [Involvement of Abscisic Acid in PSII Photodamage and D1 Protein Turnover for Light-Induced Premature Senescence of Rice Flag Leaves.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Involvement of Abscisic Acid in PSII Photodamage and D1 Protein Turnover for Light-Induced Premature Senescence of Rice Flag Leaves.%5BTitle%5D), The participation of ABA in the timing of senescence initiation and in the subsequent rate of leaf senescence was closely associated with PSII photodamage and D1 protein turnover during leaf senescence, in which the transcriptional expression of several key genes (psbA, psbB, psbC and OsFtsH2) involved in D1 protein biosynthesis and PSII repair cycle was seriously suppressed by the significantly increased ABA level
