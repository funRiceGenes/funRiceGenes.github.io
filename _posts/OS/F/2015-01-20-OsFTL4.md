* **Key message**  
    + An analysis of the effects of simulated drought stress suggested that silencing OsFTL4 enhances drought tolerance by decreasing stomatal conductance and water loss
    + These results indicate that OsFTL4 helps integrate the flowering process and the drought response in rice
    + Additionally, OsFTL4 was mainly expressed in the vascular tissue, with the resulting OsFTL4 protein localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm

* **Connection**  
    + __Hd3a__, __OsFTL4__, [OsFTL4, an FT-like Gene, Regulates Flowering Time and Drought Tolerance in Rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFTL4, an FT-like Gene, Regulates Flowering Time and Drought Tolerance in Rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsFTL4 was observed to compete with Hd3a for the interaction with multiple 14-3-3 proteins
