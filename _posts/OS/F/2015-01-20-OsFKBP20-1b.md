* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsFKBP20-1b was highly upregulated under various abiotic stresses
    + Moreover genetic analysis revealed that OsFKBP20-1b positively affected transcription and pre-mRNA splicing of stress-responsive genes under abiotic stress conditions
    + OsFKBP20-1b interacts with the splicing factor OsSR45 and participates in the environmental stress response at the post-transcriptional level in rice.
    + Nuclear OsFKBP20-1b maintains SR34 stability and promotes the splicing of retained introns upon ABA exposure in rice.
    + OsFKBP20-1b facilitates the splicing of mRNAs with retained introns after ABA treatment; some of these mRNAs are translatable and encode functional transcriptional regulators of stress-responsive genes
    + In addition, interacting proteins, OsSR34 and OsSR45, regulate the splicing of the same retained introns as OsFKBP20-1b after ABA treatment
    + We determined the AS landscape of wild-type and osfkbp20-1b knockout plants upon abscisic acid (ABA) treatment by transcriptome deep sequencing
