* **Key message**  
    + Evidently decreased grain width, grain thickness, and endosperm filling rate were detected in the osfrk3 mutants (osfrk3-1 and osfrk3-2) compared with those of the WT
    + These results suggest that OsFRK3 may positively regulate the accumulation of starch through influencing the sugar metabolism
