* **Key message**  
    + A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance
    + And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants
