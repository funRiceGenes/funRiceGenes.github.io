* **Key message**  
    + The Al-induced inhibition of the root elongation was similar between the OsFRDL2 knockout line and its wild type rice
    + Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.
    + Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
    + Collectively, our results indicate that although OsFRDL2 is involved in the Al-induced secretion of citrate, its contribution to high Al tolerance is relatively small in rice
