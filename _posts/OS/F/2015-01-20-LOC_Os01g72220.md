    + __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis
    + __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA

    + __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), The protein-protein interaction between OsFY and OsFCA-gamma, the key feature of their gene function, was also demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system
    + __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots
