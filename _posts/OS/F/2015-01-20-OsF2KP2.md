* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The results imply that OsF2KP2 participates in the glycolytic pathway by providing precursors and energy for synthesis of grain storage compounds
    + Mutation of OsF2KP2 decreased Fru-2,6-P(2) content in endosperm cells, leading to drastically reduced phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate contents and disordered glycolysis and energy metabolism
    + Fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase/Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase Regulates Energy Metabolism and Synthesis of Storage Products in Developing Rice Endosperm
    + The results imply that OsF2KP2 participates in the glycolytic pathway by providing precursors and energy for synthesis of grain storage compounds.
