* **Key message**  
    + In situ hybridization experiments showed the transcripts of OsFOR1 are present in young spikelet primordia and in almost all of the young floral organs
    + OsFOR1 transcript was not detected in the frizzy panicle mutant, which is defective in its spikelet formation but normal in inflorescence-meristem initiation and maintenance
    + Antisense expression of OsFOR1 resulted in an increase in the numbers of floral organs, including the stamen, carpel, palea/lemma, stigma, and lodicule
    + We have isolated a cDNA clone, OsFOR1, from the immature panicles of rice
    + OsFOR1 is highly expressed in the calli and immature and mature panicles, while detectable at only low levels in seedling roots and mature stems
    + The OsFOR1 gene encodes a polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) that regulates floral organ number in rice
    + The OsFOR1 (Oryza sativa floral organ regulator 1) gene encodes a protein that contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain
    + Therefore, we suggest that OsFOR1 plays a role in the formation and/or maintenance of floral organ primordia

* **Connection**  
    + __OsFOR1~PGIP__, __OsPGIP4__, [The polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 4 OsPGIP4, a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus, confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 4 OsPGIP4, a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus, confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.%5BTitle%5D), Our results not only provide the first report that rice PGIP could enhance resistant against a bacterial pathogen but also indicate that OsPGIP4 is a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus for bacterial leaf streak in rice
