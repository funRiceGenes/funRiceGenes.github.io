## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: We demonstrated that ectopically expressed OsFLS2 in Arabidopsis senses the eliciting flg22 peptide and in vitro purified Acidovorax avenae (Aa) flagellin in an expression level-dependent manner, but does not recognize purified flagellins or derivative flg22(Xo) peptides of Xanthomonas oryzae pvs  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __growth__, [Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice
2. __cell death__, [Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin
