* **Key message**  
    + However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice
    + OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin
