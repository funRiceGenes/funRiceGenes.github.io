* **Key message**  
    + RNA in situ hybridization showed that the accumulation of Osfad8 mRNA was abundant in leaves but hardly detectable in roots
    + " Fatty acid analysis of homozygous OsFAD8 T-DNA knockout mutant and wild type plants have exhibited changes in fatty acid composition after cold stress, thus confirming that OsFAD8 gene codes for omega-3 fatty acid desaturase activity at low temperature
    + Photosynthetic efficiency and recovery of OsFAD8 knockout mutants are significantly reduced after cold stress as compared to those of wild type plants"
    + The Osfad8 transcript level in leaves was much higher at 15 degrees C than at normal temperature (25 degrees C)
    + These data suggest that Osfad8 encodes a temperature-dependent chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase
    + "Expression of two rice plastidial omega-3 desaturase genes, OsFAD7 and OsFAD8 under different temperatures has been investigated
    + Transcript levels of OsFAD7 increased at high temperature; while those of OsFAD8 increased at low temperatures
    + Fatty acid analysis of homozygous OsFAD8 T-DNA knockout mutant and wild type plants have exhibited changes in fatty acid composition after cold stress, thus confirming that OsFAD8 gene codes for omega-3 fatty acid desaturase activity at low temperature
    + Characterization of OsFAD8 suggests that it has a functional role in maintaining levels of trienoic fatty acids and stress tolerance at low temperatures
    + Effects of low temperature stress on rice (Oryza sativa L.) plastid Ï‰-3 desaturase gene, OsFAD8 and its functional analysis using T-DNA mutants"
    + A cDNA, designated Osfad8, encoding a chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase responsible for trienoic fatty acid formation, was isolated from the leaves of Oryza sativa L
    + At room temperature (28 ¡ãC), osfad8 plants exhibited significant alterations in fatty acid (FA) unsaturation for all four investigated plastidic lipid classes
    + Taken together, our findings suggest that FA unsaturation by OsFAD8 is crucial for the acclimation of higher plants to low-temperature stress
