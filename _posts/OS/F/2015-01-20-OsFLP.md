* **Key message**  
    + Our results reveal that OsFLP is probably a multiple functional regulator involved in many biological processes in growth development and stress responses in rice
    + Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp
    + However, we mainly focus on the role of OsFLP in salt stress response
    + Consistently, phenotypic analysis under salt stress conditions showed that osflp exhibited significant sensitivity to salt stress, while OsFLP over-expression lines displayed obvious salt tolerance
    + Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice
