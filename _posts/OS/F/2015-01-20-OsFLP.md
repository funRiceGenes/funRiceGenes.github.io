* **Key message**  
    + Our results reveal that OsFLP is probably a multiple functional regulator involved in many biological processes in growth development and stress responses in rice
    + Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp
    + However, we mainly focus on the role of OsFLP in salt stress response
    + Consistently, phenotypic analysis under salt stress conditions showed that osflp exhibited significant sensitivity to salt stress, while OsFLP over-expression lines displayed obvious salt tolerance
    + Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice
    + A Rice R2R3-Type MYB Transcription Factor OsFLP Positively Regulates Drought Stress Response via OsNAC.
    + Overexpression of OsFLP showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses
    + These findings suggested that OsFLP positively participates in drought stress, mainly through regulating regulators&#x27; transcripts of OsNAC1 and OsNAC6
    + OsFLP was transiently induced by drought, salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA)
    + Here, OsFLP was identified as an R2R3-MYB transcriptional activator and localized in the nucleus
