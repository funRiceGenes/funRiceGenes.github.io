## Expression information

## Key message
1. __grain__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds
2. __seed__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds

## Connection
1. __OsFKI__, __OsFKII__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)), Two cDNA clones, OsFKI and OsFKII, encoding fructokinase (EC 2
2. __OsFKI__, __OsFKII__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, OsFKII cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 336 amino acids that shared only 64% amino acid identity with OsFKI
3. __OsFKI__, __OsFKII__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The identity of OsFKI and OsFKII as fructokinases was confirmed by the expression of enzyme activity in E
4. __OsFKI__, __OsFKII__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Although both OsFKI and OsFKII utilized fructose as substrate, only OsFKII activity was strongly inhibited at a high fructose concentration
5. __OsFKI__, __OsFKII__, [Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds
