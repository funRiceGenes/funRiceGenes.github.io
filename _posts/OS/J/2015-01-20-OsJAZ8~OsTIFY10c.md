## Key message
1. __blight__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
2. __ ja __, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway
3. __ ja __, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice
4. __jasmonate__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA
5. __jasmonate__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
6. __bacterial blight__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
7. __ xoo __, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, OsJAZ8DeltaC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice
8. __defense__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8DeltaC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice"

## Connection
1. __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ8~OsTIFY10c__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner
