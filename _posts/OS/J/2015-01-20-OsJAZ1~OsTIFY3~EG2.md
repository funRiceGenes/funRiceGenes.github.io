* **Key message**  
    + These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance
    + We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development
    + In addition, there were significant differences in shoot and root length between the OsJAZ1 transgenic and WT plants under the MeJA and ABA treatments
    + OsJAZ1 Attenuates Drought Resistance by Regulating JA and ABA Signaling in Rice.
    + In this study, OsJAZ1 was investigated for its role in drought resistance in rice
    + These results together suggest that OsJAZ1 plays a role in regulating the drought resistance of rice partially via the ABA and JA pathways
    + Expression of OsJAZ1 was strongly responsive to JA treatment, and it was slightly responsive to ABA, salicylic acid, and abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and cold
    + A subcellular localization assay indicated that OsJAZ1 was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + The OsJAZ1 degron modulates jasmonate signaling sensitivity during rice development.
    + To clarify this question, we performed bioassays and genetic experiments to uncover the function of the OsJAZ1 degron in rice JA signaling
    + Here, we found that OsJAZ6 interacts with OsJAZ1 depending on a single amino acid in the so-called ZIM domain of OsJAZ6 in rice JA signaling transduction and JA-regulated rice spikelet development
