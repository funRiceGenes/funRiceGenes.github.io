## Key message
1. __drought__, ["OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance
2. __jasmonate__, [OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance
3. __drought tolerance__, ["OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance
4. __JA signalling repressor __, [Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development

## Connection
1. __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ1~OsTIFY3~EG2__, [OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine
2. __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ1~OsTIFY3~EG2__, [OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the OsJAZ1 protein was degraded by rice and Arabidopsis extracts in the presence of coronatine, and its degradation was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsJAZ1 via the SCF(OsCOI1) complex

5. __OsMYC2__, __OsJAZ1~OsTIFY3~EG2__, [Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development.
