* **Key message**  
    + Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
    + OsJMT1 is up-regulated in response to infestation with the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens)
    + After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA
