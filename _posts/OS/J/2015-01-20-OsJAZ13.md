* **Key message**  
    + Gene-expression analysis suggested the role of OsJAZ13 in modulating the expression of JA/ethylene response-related genes to regulate growth and activate hypersensitive cell death
    + OsJAZ13 Negatively Regulates Jasmonate Signaling and Activates Hypersensitive Cell Death Response in Rice
    + The expression of OsJAZ13 was mainly activated in vegetative tissues and transiently responded to JA and ethylene
    + Taken together, these observations describe a novel regulatory mechanism in rice and provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsJAZ13 in signal transduction and cell death in plants
