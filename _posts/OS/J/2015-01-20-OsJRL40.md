* **Key message**  
    + RNA-seq analysis revealed that OsJRL40 regulates salt tolerance in rice by controlling the expression of genes encoding Na(+)/K(+) transporters, salt-responsive transcription factors, and other salt response-related proteins
    + The loss of function of OsJRL40 increased sensitivity to salt stress in rice, whereas its overexpression enhanced salt tolerance at the seedling stage and during reproductive growth
    + Further molecular analyses showed that OsJRL40 enhances antioxidant enzyme activities and regulates Na(+)-K(+) homeostasis under salt stress
    + Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter assays indicated that OsJRL40 is expressed to higher levels in roots and internodes than in other tissues, and subcellular localization analysis revealed that the OsJRL40 protein localizes to the cytoplasm
