    + OsJAR1 Contributes Mainly to Biosynthesis of the Stress-Induced Jasmonoyl-Isoleucine Involved in Defense Responses in Rice
    + In addition, OsJAR1 was required for normal seed development in rice under field conditions
    + In WT seedlings, OsJar1 transcripts were up-regulated transiently in response to treatment with exogenous methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA)
    + " Our results suggest that OsJAR1 possesses at least two major functions in rice defense and development that cannot be complemented by the additional OsJAR2 gene function, although this gene previously showed overlapping enzyme activity in vitro"
    + Response of rice to insect elicitors and the role of OsJAR1 in wound and herbivory-induced JA-Ile accumulation
    + We isolated rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (osjar1) mutants from the Tos17 mutant panel by BLAST search
    + The osjar1 mutant was also found to be more susceptible to the blast fungus than the parental wild type
    + In contrast, only the expression of OsJAR1 was associated with the accumulation of JA-Ile after blast infection
    + In summary, this paper demonstrated that OsJar1 modulates light and JA signalling in the photomorphogenesis of rice
    + OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling
