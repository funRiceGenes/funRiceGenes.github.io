* **Key message**  
    + On the other hand, positively transformed T(0) plants with the OsTPKa gene from Horkuch consistently showed growth advantage under both control and salt stress
    + DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the transgenic plants with the down-regulated genes OsTPKa and OsHAK_like under salt stress supports the assumption that OsTPKa and OsHAK_like play important roles in defending the rice landrace Horkuch against salt stress, minimizing salt injury, and maintaining plant growth
    + Moreover, the growth advantage provided by overexpression of the vacuolar OsTPKa K(+) transporter, particularly under salt stress reconfirms its important role in providing salt tolerance
    + These are OsTPKa or Vacuolar two-pore potassium channel and OsHAK_like or a hypothetical protein of the HAK family
