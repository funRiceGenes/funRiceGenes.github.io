* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation
    + OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
    + Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways
    + Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
