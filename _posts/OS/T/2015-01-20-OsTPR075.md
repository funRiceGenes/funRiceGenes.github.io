* **Key message**  
    + The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.
    + Our findings suggest that florigen transport in rice is mediated by different OsFTIPs under different photoperiods and that interactions between OsTPR075 and OsFTIPs are essential for mediating florigen movement from leaves to the SAM
