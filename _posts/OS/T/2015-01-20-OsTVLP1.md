* **Key message**  
    + The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
    + Importantly, the expression of OsTVLP1 was activated specifically in disease resistance response induced by BTH and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus
    + Our observations suggest that OsTVLP1 may play a role in rice disease resistance response against pathogen infection
