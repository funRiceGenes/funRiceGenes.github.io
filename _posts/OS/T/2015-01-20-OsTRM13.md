* **Key message**  
    + The 2'-O-methyladenosine nucleoside modification gene OsTRM13 positively regulates salt stress tolerance in rice.
    + OsTRM13 transcript levels increased significantly upon salt stress and ABA treatment, and the OsTrm13 protein was found to be located primarily to the nucleus
    + More importantly, OsTRM13 overexpression plants displayed improved salt stress tolerance, and vice versa, OsTRM13 RNA interference (RNAi) plants showed reduced tolerance
