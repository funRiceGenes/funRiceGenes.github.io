* **Key message**  
    + We report here that the gene MICROSPORELESS2 (MIL2) regulates early anther cell differentiation in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + The anthers of mil2 mutants were characterized using molecular markers and cytological examination
    + However, mil2 anthers display phenotypes different from those of tpd1 mutants, with only two layers of anther wall cells formed
    + Our results demonstrate that MIL2 is responsible for the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers, and suggest that rice and Arabidopsis anthers might share similar regulators in anther patterning, but divergent mechanisms are employed in these processes
    + MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther
    + Both are co-expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co-expressed in the ovule
    + When driven by the maize Ubiquitin1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL1A phenocopies msp1 in the ovule but not in the anther
    + MIL2 encodes the rice homolog of the Arabidopsis TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) protein
