## Connection
1. __OsMED4__, __OsTFIIF2-1__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D), TFIIF2 and RPC53 are counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4.
