## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content
2. __photosynthesis__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants
3. __chloroplast__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Ostrxm was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol-dependent insulin beta-chain reduction activity in vitro
4. __chloroplast__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content
5. __chloroplast__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants
6. __chloroplast__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The pleiotropic effects of Ostrxm RNAi suggest that Ostrxm plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions
