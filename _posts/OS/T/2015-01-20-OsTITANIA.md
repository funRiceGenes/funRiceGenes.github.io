* **Key message**  
    + A rice PHD-finger protein OsTITANIA, is a growth regulator that functions through elevating expression of transporter genes for multiple metals.
    + OsTTA is required for the maintenance of metal transport©\associated gene expression
    + These findings establish that OsTTA is a transcription factor that supports basic metal supply to the growing portions of plants and is part of an environmental response mechanism.
