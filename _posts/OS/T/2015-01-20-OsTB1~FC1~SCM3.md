* **Key message**  
    + We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching
    + The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering
    + We propose that FC1 acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice
    + On the other hand, the expression level of FC1 is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment
    + Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
    + Expression of OsTB1, as examined with a putative promoter-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion, was observed throughout the axillary bud, as well as the basal part of the shoot apical meristem, vascular tissues in the pith and the lamina joint
    + An in situ hybridization analysis showed that FC1 mRNA accumulates in axillary buds, the shoot apical meristem, young leaves, vascular tissues and the tips of crown roots
    + We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 (fc1) mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog
    + Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 (10 microM) causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on fc1 mutants, implying that proper FC1 functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth
    + Overexpression of FC1 partially rescued d3-2 defects in the tiller growth and plant height
    + The rice TB1 gene (OsTB1) was first identified based on its sequence similarity with maize TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1), which is involved in lateral branching in maize
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTB1 exhibited markedly reduced lateral branching without the propagation of axillary buds being affected
    + Taking these data together, we concluded that OsTB1 functions as a negative regulator for lateral branching in rice, presumably through expression in axillary buds
    + The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice
    + FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
    + Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
    + The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
    + In addition, we present observations that suggest that FINE CULM1 (FC1), a rice ortholog of teosinte branched 1 (tb1), possibly works independently of the branching inhibitor pathway
    + Our study of a locus involved in resistance to lodging demonstrated that saturation editing of the qSCSA3-1/OsTB1/SCM3 region led to loss-of-function, normal-like, and gain-of-function plant types, based on OsTB1 expression and stem cross-section area
    + One gain-of-function allele recapitulated a previously described beneficial allele of OsTB1 carrying a TGTG insertion in the 5' region of OsTB1 and enhanced OsTB1 expression at the inflorescence formation stage
