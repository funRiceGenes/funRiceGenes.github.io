    + RNA Binding Protein OsTZF7 Traffics Between the Nucleus and Processing Bodies/Stress Granules and Positively Regulates Drought Stress in Rice.
    + Accordingly, the overexpression of OsTZF7 increased drought tolerance and enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA in rice, whereas the knockdown of OsTZF7 resulted in the opposite phenotype
    + Together, these results indicate that OsTZF7 positively regulates drought response in rice via ABA signaling and may be involved in mRNA turnover
    + The expression of OsTZF7 was upregulated by abiotic stresses, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, NaCl, and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice
    + In this study, we characterized the biological and molecular functions of a novel tandem zinc finger protein, OsTZF7
    + We demonstrated that OsTZF7 can traffic between the nucleus and PBs/SGs, and the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) mediates the nuclear export of OsTZF7
    + RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes related to &quot;response to stress,&quot; &quot;abscisic acid signaling,&quot; &quot;methylated histone binding,&quot; and &quot;cytoplasmic mRNA processing body&quot; are regulated by OsTZF7
