* **Key message**  
    + OsTLP27 transcripts accumulated specifically in green tissues such as the leaf blade and leaf sheath, and the levels of its transcripts followed a circadian rhythm
    + OsTLP27 was predicted to encode a thylakoid lumen protein of unknown function in chloroplast, and chloroplast targeting of OsTLP27 was confirmed by transient expression of a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP)
    + Overexpression of OsTLP27 also enhanced transcript levels of genes related to chloroplast function and caused changes in the grana size and number
    + These data suggested that OsTLP27 encodes a protein with a novel function in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice
    + Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency
