* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ
    + wp2 and Ostrx z knockout lines show reduced editing efficiencies in many plastidial-encoded genes especially under high temperature conditions

* **Connection**  
    + __OsTRXZ~WP2__, __TCD5~CSV1~TSV__, [TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z%5BTitle%5D), Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures.
    + __OsTRXZ~WP2__, __WLP2~OsFLN1__, [White Leaf and Panicle 2, encoding a PEP-associated protein, is required for chloroplast biogenesis under heat stress in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=White Leaf and Panicle 2, encoding a PEP-associated protein, is required for chloroplast biogenesis under heat stress in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, WLP2 and its paralog OsFLN2 can physically interact with thioredoxin OsTRXz to form a TRX-FLN regulatory module, which not only regulates transcription of the PEP-encoded genes but also maintains the redox balance in chloroplasts under heat stress
    + __OsTRXZ~WP2__, __WLP2~OsFLN1__, [FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 interacts with TRXz to regulate chloroplast development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 interacts with TRXz to regulate chloroplast development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments revealed that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 interact with THIOREDOXINZ (OsTRXz) to regulate chloroplast development
    + __OsTRXZ~WP2__, __WLP2~OsFLN1__, [FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 interacts with TRXz to regulate chloroplast development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1 interacts with TRXz to regulate chloroplast development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis revealed that the transcription and translation of PEP-dependent genes were strongly inhibited in fln1 and trxz mutants, indicating that loss of OsFLN1, HSA1/OsFLN2, or OsTRXz function perturbs the stability of the transcriptionally active chromosome complex and PEP activity
