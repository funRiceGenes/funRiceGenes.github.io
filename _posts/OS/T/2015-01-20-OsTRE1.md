## Key message
1. __resistance__, [Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1
2. __drought__, [Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1
3. __drought stress__, [Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1
