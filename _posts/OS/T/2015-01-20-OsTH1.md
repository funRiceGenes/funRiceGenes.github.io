* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We also found that alternative splicing and translation allowed OsTH1 to be localized to both chloroplast and cytosol
    + Our study revealed that OsTH1 was an essential enzyme in VB1 biosynthesis and played crucial roles in seedling growth and development by participating in fatty acid and sugar metabolism, providing new perspectives on VB1 function in rice
    + OsTH1 encoded a phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase/thiamin-phosphate pyrophosphorylase, and was expressed in various tissues, especially in seedlings, leaves, and young panicles
