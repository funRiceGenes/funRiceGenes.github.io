* **Key message**  
    + To characterize the rice (Oryza sativa) tonoplast monosaccharide transporters, OsTMT1 and OsTMT2, we analysed their subcellular localization using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expression patterns using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assay and in situ hybridization analysis, and assessed sugar transport ability using isolated vacuoles
    + Analyses of OsTMT promoter-GUS transgenic rice indicated that OsTMT1 and OsTMT2 are highly expressed in bundle sheath cells, and in vascular parenchyma and companion cells in leaves, respectively
    + The modification of the sugar transport between cytosol and vacuole mediated by OsTST1 induces deregulation of several genes including transcription factors (TFs)
    + In summary, no matter the location of sucrose and sink is, these preliminary results revealed that OsTST1 was important for sugar transport from source to sink tissues, thus affecting plant growth and development
    + OsTST1 affects yield and development and mediates sugar transportation of plants from source to sink in rice, which influences the accumulation of intermediate metabolites from tricarboxylic acid cycle indirectly
    + ) sugar transport protein OsTST1 affects yield and development
    + In this study, we found that OsTST1 knockout mutants generated via CRISPR/Cas9 exhibited slower development, smaller seeds, and lower yield than wild type (WT) rice plants
    + Changes in rice leaves at 14 days after germination (DAG) and at 10 days after flowering (DAF) suggested that OsTST1 affected the accumulation of intermediate metabolites from the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
    + OsTST1, a key tonoplast sugar transporter from source to sink, plays essential roles in affecting yields and height of rice (Oryza sativa L.)
