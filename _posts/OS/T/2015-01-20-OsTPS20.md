* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsTPS20  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os04g27340](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g27340)

* **Publication**  
    + [Rice terpene synthase 20 OsTPS20 plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice terpene synthase 20 OsTPS20 plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Protoplasma.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of OsTPS20 were significantly induced in response to oxidative stress, thereby suggesting that OsTPS20 plays a major role in producing terpene volatiles during abiotic stress

* **Connection**  
    + __OsTPS19__, __OsTPS20__, [The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D),  OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event
    + __OsTPS19__, __OsTPS20__, [The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D),  We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity
    + __OsTPS19__, __OsTPS20__, [The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D),  This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20
