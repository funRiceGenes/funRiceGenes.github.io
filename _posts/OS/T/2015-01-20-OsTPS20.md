## Key message
1. __oxidative stress__, [Rice terpene synthase 20 OsTPS20 plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice terpene synthase 20 OsTPS20 plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of OsTPS20 were significantly induced in response to oxidative stress, thereby suggesting that OsTPS20 plays a major role in producing terpene volatiles during abiotic stress
