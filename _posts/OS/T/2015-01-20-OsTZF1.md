* **Key message**  
    + The OsTZF1 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves and shoots, although its transcripts were detected in various organs
    + Expression of OsTZF1 was induced by drought, high-salt stress, and hydrogen peroxide
    + Ubi:OsTZF1-OX plants showed improved tolerance to high-salt and drought stresses and vice versa for OsTZF1-RNAi plants
    + Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues
    + In addition, OsTZF1 expression was regulated by salt, PEG, and ABA
    + Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to stress, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and metal homeostasis were regulated in the Ubi:OsTZF1-OX plants
    + Overexpression of OsTZF1 caused a long leaf sheath relative to wild type (WT) under R and FR, suggesting that OsTZF1 probably acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTZF1 driven by a maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:OsTZF1-OX [for overexpression]) exhibited delayed seed germination, growth retardation at the seedling stage, and delayed leaf senescence
    + RNA interference (RNAi) knocked-down plants (OsTZF1-RNAi) showed early seed germination, enhanced seedling growth, and early leaf senescence compared with controls
    + Here, we investigated a cytoplasmic TZF protein, OsTZF1, which is involved in photomorphogenesis and ABA responses in rice seedlings
    + Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was marked in the OsTZF1-overexpression lines compared with WT, suggesting the positive regulation of OsTZF1 to ABA responses
    + Overexpression of a phytochrome-regulated tandem zinc finger protein gene, OsTZF1, confers hypersensitivity to ABA and hyposensitivity to red light and far-red light in rice seedlings
    + OsTZF1 gene expression was also induced by abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid
    + OsTZF1, a CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, confers delayed senescence and stress tolerance in rice by regulating stress-related genes
    + KEY MESSAGE: OsTZF1 encodes a cytoplasm-localized tandem zinc finger protein and is regulated by both ABA and phytochrome-mediated light signaling
    + OsTZF1 functions in phytochrome-mediated light and ABA responses in rice
    + Here, we report that transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTZF1 under own promoter (P(OsTZF1):OsTZF1-OX [for overexpression]) transferred to soil showed normal growth similar to vector control plants
