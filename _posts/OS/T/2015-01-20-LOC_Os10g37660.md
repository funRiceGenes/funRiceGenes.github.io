* **Key message**  
    + Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1
    + An expression analysis in young seedlings revealed that OsTRE1 is induced by stresses such as salt, drought, and chilling
    + The OsTRE1 overexpressors did not have notable morphological alterations or growth defects but exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting the involvement of OsTRE1 in salt stress tolerance in rice
    + ABA treatment also transiently upregulated OsTRE1 expression
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTRE1 showed remarkable increases in trehalase activity and dramatic decreases in trehalose abundance compared with the wild type, with little change in the levels of other soluble sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose
