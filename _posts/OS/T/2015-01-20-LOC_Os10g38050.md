* **Key message**  
    + Further analysis showed that the tapetal transcription factor OsMS188 directly regulates OsTMS18 for pollen wall formation
    + Cellular analysis revealed the pollen wall of ostms18 to be defective, leading to aborted pollen under high temperature
    + Under low temperature, the flawed pollen wall in ostms18 is sufficient to protect its microspore, allowing for development of functional pollen and restoring fertility
    + ostms18 sterility is more stable in summer than the TGMS line carrying the widely used locus tms5 in the ZH11 genetic background, suggesting its potential application for rice breeding
    + The ostms18 TGMS trait is caused by the point mutation from Gly to Ser in a glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase; knockout of the oxidoreductase was previously reported to cause complete male sterility
