* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsTPS8 was adequate to confer enhanced salinity tolerance without any yield penalty, suggesting its usefulness in rice genetic improvement
    + OsTPS8 controls yield-related traits and confers salt stress tolerance in rice by enhancing suberin deposition.
    + The ostps8 mutant showed salt sensitivity, ABA sensitivity and altered agronomic traits compared to the wild-type (WT), which could be rescued upon complementation
    + Our results suggest that OsTPS8 may regulate suberin deposition in rice through ABA signalling
    + The ostps8 mutant was characterised by GC-MS analysis, an abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity test and by generating transgenic lines
