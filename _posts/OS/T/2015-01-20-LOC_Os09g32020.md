    + Ostkpr1 functions in anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice.
    + Loss of function of OsTKPR1 delayed tapetum degradation, reduced the levels of anther cuticular lipids, and impaired Ubisch body and pollen exine formation, resulting in complete male sterility
    + Localization studies suggest that OsTKPR1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, while specific accumulation of OsTKPR1 mRNA in the anther tapetum and microspores is consistent with its function in anther and pollen wall development
    + Our results show that OsTKPR1 is indispensable for anther cuticle development and pollen wall formation in rice, providing new insights into the biochemical mechanisms of the conserved sporopollenin metabolon in flowering plants
    + Furthermore, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor OsMYB103/OsMYB80/OsMS188/BM1, involved in tapetum and pollen development, regulates the expression of OsCCRL1
    + In the current study, to investigate this, we identified and analyzed the male-sterile mutant, osccrl1 (cinnamoyl coA reductase-like 1), which exhibited delayed tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and defective mature pollen
    + Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and gene knockout revealed that OsCCRL1 corresponds to the gene LOC_Os09g32020
    + OsCCRL1 was preferentially expressed in the tapetal cells and microspores, and localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm in both rice protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana leaves
    + The osccrl1 mutant exhibited reduced CCRs enzyme activity, less lignin accumulation, delayed tapetum degradation, and disrupted phenylpropanoid metabolism
