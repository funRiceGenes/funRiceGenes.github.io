* **Key message**  
    + The knockdown of OsTRXh1 results in dwarf plants with fewer tillers, whereas the overexpression of OsTRXh1 leads to a salt-sensitive phenotype in rice
    + In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of OsTRXh1 decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth
    + OsTRXh1 is ubiquitously expressed in rice, and its expression is induced by salt and abscisic acid treatments
    + Intriguingly, OsTRXh1 is secreted into the extracellular space, and salt stress in the apoplast of rice induces its expression at the protein level
    + We also analyzed the levels of hydrogen peroxide produced in transgenic plants, and the results show that more hydrogen peroxide is produced in the extracellular space of OsTRXh1 knockdown plants than in wild-type plants, whereas the OsTRXh1 overexpression plants produce less hydrogen peroxide under salt stress
    + Characterization of rice pho2 complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic OsPHO2 or OsPHO2(C445S) (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that OsPHO2(C445S) restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native OsPHO2 Moreover, the suppression of OsTrxh1 (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves
