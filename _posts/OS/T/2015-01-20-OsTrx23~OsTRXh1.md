## Key message
1. __tiller__, [An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The knockdown of OsTRXh1 results in dwarf plants with fewer tillers, whereas the overexpression of OsTRXh1 leads to a salt-sensitive phenotype in rice
2. __seed germination__, [An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of OsTRXh1 decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth
3. __growth__, [An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of OsTRXh1 decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth
4. __salt__, [An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice%5BTitle%5D), " OsTRXh1 is ubiquitously expressed in rice, and its expression is induced by salt and abscisic acid treatments
5. __salt__, [An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Intriguingly, OsTRXh1 is secreted into the extracellular space, and salt stress in the apoplast of rice induces its expression at the protein level
