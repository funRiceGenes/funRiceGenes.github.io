* **Key message**  
    + Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
    + However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
    + OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.
    + Together, our results (i) reveal that OsHUB2 represses the function of OsTrx1 and H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1 and (ii) suggest that OsHUB2-mediated H2B ubiquitination plays critical roles together with H3K4me3 in rice heading date regulation

    + __Ghd7__, __OsTrx1~SDG723__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D), However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
