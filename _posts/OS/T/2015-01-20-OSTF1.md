* **Key message**  
    + In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3~6 d after pollination
    + In this study, a gene designated OSTF1 (Oryza sativa transcription factor 1) encoding a homeodomain protein in rice was isolated and characterized
