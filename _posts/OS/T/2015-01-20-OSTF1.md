## Expression information

## Key message
1. __grain__, [OSTF1: A HD-GL2 Family Homeobox Gene is Developmentally Regulated During Early Embryogenesis in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OSTF1: A HD-GL2 Family Homeobox Gene is Developmentally Regulated During Early Embryogenesis in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3~6 d after pollination
2. __transcription factor__, [OSTF1: A HD-GL2 Family Homeobox Gene is Developmentally Regulated During Early Embryogenesis in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OSTF1: A HD-GL2 Family Homeobox Gene is Developmentally Regulated During Early Embryogenesis in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, a gene designated OSTF1 Oryza sativa transcription factor 1 encoding a homeodomain protein in rice was isolated and characterized
