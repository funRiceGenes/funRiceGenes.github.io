* **Key message**  
    + oryzae strain Guy11 specifically induced rice miR319 expression, and consequently suppressed its target gene, OsTCP21 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF), which encodes a transcription factor
    + By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease
