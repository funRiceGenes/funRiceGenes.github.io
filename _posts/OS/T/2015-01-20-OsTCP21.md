* **Key message**  
    + oryzae strain Guy11 specifically induced rice miR319 expression, and consequently suppressed its target gene, OsTCP21 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF), which encodes a transcription factor
    + By using miR319b-OE and OsTCP21-Res (resistant to miR319-mediated silencing) transgenic rice, we found that OsTCP21 is a positive regulator of rice defense response against the blast disease
    + MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice
    + These data suggest that miR319 regulates rice tiller bud development and tillering through targeting OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb
    + Notably, the tiller number and grain yield increased in STTM319 and overexpression lines of OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb but decreased in OE319a and knockout lines of OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb
    + Taken together, our findings indicate that miR319s negatively affect tiller number and grain yield by targeting OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb, revealing a novel function for miR319 in rice
    + Moreover, OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb overexpression lines and STTM319 had increased tiller bud length and biomass, whereas both were decreased in OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb knockout lines and OE319a
