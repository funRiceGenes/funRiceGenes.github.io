* **Key message**  
    + To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes
    + Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of OsTPS1 showed that OsTPS1 is inducible by drought, salt, cold, and ABA
    + Leaves of OsTPS1 knockout (KO) plants were more sensitive to drought or cold stress than were the wild types
    + Characterization of a drought-responsive gene, OsTPS1, identified by the T-DNA gene-trap system in rice
    + These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes
    + Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice
    + Therefore, we propose that OsTPS1 plays an important role during the abiotic stress response
    + Furthermore, transgenic rice of UBI::CBF1 had high expression OsTPS1 mRNA, suggesting that OsTPS1 is regulated by the CBF/DREB transcription factor
    + Further experiments demonstrated that the natural variation in the disease resistance level was associated with differential transcription of OsTPS1 due to polymorphisms in its promoter
    + We demonstrated that OsTPS1 was regulated at the epigenetic level by JMJ705 through the methyl jasmonate pathway
