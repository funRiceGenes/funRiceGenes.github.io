* **Key message**  
    + OsTPR boosts the superior grains through increase in upper secondary rachis branches without incurring a grain quality penalty.
    + This confirmed a critical role for OsTPR in influencing yield while maintaining grain and nutritional quality
    + Through haplotype mining, we further demonstrated the synergy of offering added yield advantage due to superior allele of OsTPR in elite materials with low glycaemic index (GI) property
