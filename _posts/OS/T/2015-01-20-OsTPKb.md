## Connection
1. __OsTPKa__, __OsTPKb__, [Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles%5BTitle%5D)),  The Oryza sativa genome encodes two TPK isoforms (TPKa and TPKb) that have very similar sequences and are ubiquitously expressed
2. __OsTPKa__, __OsTPKb__, [Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles%5BTitle%5D)),  In spite of high levels of similarity in sequence and transport properties, the cellular localization of TPKa and TPKb channels was different, with TPKa localization predominantly at the large LV and TPKb primarily in smaller PSV-type compartments
3. __OsTPKa__, __OsTPKb__, [Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles%5BTitle%5D)),  Trafficking of TPKa was sensitive to brefeldin A, while that of TPKb was not
