## Key message
1. __salinity__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D), " Overexpression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to the stress hormone, abscisic acid, and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration"
2. __auxin__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
3. __flower__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D),  The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus
4. __cytokinin__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
