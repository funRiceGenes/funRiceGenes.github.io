* **Key message**  
    + Although OsTrxh2 positively regulates rice immunity by catalyzing the dissociation of OsNPR1 into monomers in rice, the XopI effector serves as an F-box adapter to form an OSK1-XopI-OsTrxh2 interaction complex, and further disrupts OsNPR1-mediated resistance through proteasomal degradation of OsTrxh2
    + Our results indicate that XopI targets OsTrxh2 and further represses OsNPR1-dependent signaling, thereby subverting systemic acquired resistance (SAR) immunity in rice
