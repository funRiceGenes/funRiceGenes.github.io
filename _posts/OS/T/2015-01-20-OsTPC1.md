* **Key message**  
    + Rice OsTPC1 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (PM), and assumed to play an important role as a Ca(2)(+)-permeable cation channel in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2)(+) rise and innate immune responses including hypersensitive cell death and phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells triggered by a fungal elicitor, xylanase from Trichoderma viride
    + A putative voltage-gated cation channel, OsTPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in hypersensitive cell death induced by a fungal xylanase protein (TvX) in suspension-cultured rice cells
    + OsTPC1 rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1
    + OsTPC1-overexpressing cells showed hypersensitivity to excess Ca2+ but higher growth rate under Ca2+ limitation, while growth of the OsTPC1-knockout cultured cells was less sensitive to extracellular free Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that OsTPC1 has Ca2+ transport activity across the plasma membrane
    + OsTPC1-overexpressing plants showed reduced growth and abnormal greening of roots
    + Growth of Ostpc1 seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants
    + These results suggest that OsTPC1 functions as a Ca2+ -permeable channel involved in the regulation of growth and development
    + Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice
    + We here identified a gene (OsTPC1) encoding a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from rice, ubiquitously expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured cells
