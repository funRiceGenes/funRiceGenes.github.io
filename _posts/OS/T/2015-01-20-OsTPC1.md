## Key message
1. __cell death__, [Intracellular localization and physiological function of a rice Ca2+-permeable channel OsTPC1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Intracellular localization and physiological function of a rice Ca2+-permeable channel OsTPC1%5BTitle%5D),  Rice OsTPC1 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane PM), and assumed to play an important role as a Ca2+-permeable cation channel in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ rise and innate immune responses including hypersensitive cell death and phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells triggered by a fungal elicitor, xylanase from Trichoderma viride

3. __growth__, [Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel OsTPC1 involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel OsTPC1 involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsTPC1 rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1
