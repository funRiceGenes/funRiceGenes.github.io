    + __OsTRBF1__, __OsTRBF2__, [Identification and characterization of three telomere repeat-binding factors in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of three telomere repeat-binding factors in rice%5BTitle%5D), Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays indicated that both OsTRBF1 and OsTRBF2 interact with one another to form homo- and hetero-complexes, while OsTRBF3 appeared to act as a monomer.
