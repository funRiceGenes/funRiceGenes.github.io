* **Key message**  
    + Analysis of candidate genes showed that two genes, the similar to transthyretin-like protein OsTTL and the serine/threonine protein kinase OsSAPK1, were the causal genes of qNL3
    + Germination tests indicated that both Osttl and Ossapk1 mutants significantly reduced seed germination under salt stress compared to the wild type
