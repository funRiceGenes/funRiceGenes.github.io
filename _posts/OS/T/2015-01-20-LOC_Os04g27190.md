* **Key message**  
    + The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an (S)-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
    + Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M
    + oryzae, a terpene synthase gene OsTPS19 was identified as a candidate defense gene
    + OsTPS19 was determined to function as an (S)-limonene synthase in rice and plays a role in defense against M
    + oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen

* **Connection**  
    + __OsTPS19__, __OsTPS20__, [The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D),  OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event
    + __OsTPS19__, __OsTPS20__, [The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D),  We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity
    + __OsTPS19__, __OsTPS20__, [The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Terpene Synthase Gene OsTPS19 Functions as an S-Limonene Synthase in planta and its Overexpression Leads to Enhanced Resistance to the Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D),  This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20
