* **Key message**  
    + OsThi9 was localized to the cell wall and was shown to bind Cd; these characters help to increase Cd tolerance
    + In Cd-exposed rice plants, OsThi9 overexpression significantly increased cell wall Cd binding, decreasing upward Cd translocation and subsequent Cd accumulation in shoots and straw, while OsThi9 knockout had inverse effects
    + Plant Defensin-Dissimilar Thionin OsThi9 Alleviates Cadmium Toxicity in Rice Plants and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grains.
    + Here, cadmium (Cd)-related functions and mechanisms of the defensin-dissimilar rice thionin OsThi9 were investigated
