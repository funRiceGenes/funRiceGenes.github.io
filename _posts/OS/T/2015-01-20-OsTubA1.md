* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + RNA gel-blot analysis demonstrated that OsTubA1 RNA was accumulated mainly at root tips, supporting that the gene is expressed preferentially in actively dividing tissues: root tips, young leaves, and flowers of the meiotic to mitotic pollen stage during rice growth and development.
