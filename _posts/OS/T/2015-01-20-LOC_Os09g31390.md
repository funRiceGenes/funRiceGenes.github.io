* **Key message**  
    + OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status
    + Transcription factor OsTGA10 is a target of the MADS protein OsMADS8 and is required for tapetum development.
    + OsTGA10 was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of OsTGA10 resulted in male sterility
    + Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development
    + Furthermore, the defective endothecium in ostga10 implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development
    + In addition, in ostga10 stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective
    + OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development, and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes
