## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Close examination revealed that regulation of meristem fate was compromised in asp1: degeneration of the inflorescence meristem was delayed, transition from the branch meristem to the spikelet meristem was accelerated, and stem cell maintenance in both the branch meristem and the spikelet meristem was compromised
2. __meristem__, [Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice%5BTitle%5D),  It is likely that the pleiotropic defects are associated with de-repression of multiple genes related to meristem function in the asp1 mutant
3. __branching__, [Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we analyzed a recessive mutant of rice, aberrant spikelet and panicle1 asp1), that showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as a disorganized branching pattern, aberrant spikelet morphology, and disarrangement of phyllotaxy
