    + [TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z.%5BTitle%5D), 2017, New Phytol.

* **Key message**  
    + We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ

* **Connection**  
    + __OsTRXZ__, __TCD5~CSV1~TSV__, [TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z%5BTitle%5D), Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures.
    + __OsTRXZ__, __WLP2__, [White Leaf and Panicle 2, encoding a PEP-associated protein, is required for chloroplast biogenesis under heat stress in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=White Leaf and Panicle 2, encoding a PEP-associated protein, is required for chloroplast biogenesis under heat stress in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, WLP2 and its paralog OsFLN2 can physically interact with thioredoxin OsTRXz to form a TRX-FLN regulatory module, which not only regulates transcription of the PEP-encoded genes but also maintains the redox balance in chloroplasts under heat stress
