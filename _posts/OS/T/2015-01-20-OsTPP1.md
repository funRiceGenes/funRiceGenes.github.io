* **Key message**  
    + Application of exogenous ABA (50 microM) resulted in a transient increase of OsTPP1 expression within 20 min of the treatment, thereby suggesting involvement of ABA in OsTPP1 gene regulation
    + Expression analysis demonstrated that OsTPP1 was initially and transiently up-regulated after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments but slowly up-regulated under cold stress
    + OsTPP1 overexpression in rice enhanced tolerance to salt and cold stress
    + Northern blots revealed that the OsTPP1 transcript levels were fairly low or under detectable limits in most of the tissues under ambient conditions but were highly induced within 1-2 h of chilling stress (12 degrees C) in both root and shoot tissues of seedlings
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
    + Transient expression of OsTPP1 was also induced under severe chilling stress (4 degrees C) as well as salinity and drought stresses at ambient temperatures
    + Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice
    + Analysis of the overexpression lines revealed that OsTPP1 triggered abiotic stress response genes, which suggests a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by OsTPP1
    + The current study revealed the mechanism of an OsTPP gene involved in stress tolerance in rice and also suggested the use of OsTPP1 in abiotic stress engineering of crops
