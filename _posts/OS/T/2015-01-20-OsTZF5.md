* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTZF5 under the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter exhibited improved survival under drought but also growth retardation
    + By introducing OsTZF5 behind the stress-responsive OsNAC6 promoter in two commercial upland cultivars, Curinga and NERICA4, we obtained transgenic plants that showed no growth retardation
    + Expression of the CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein gene OsTZF5 under a stress-inducible promoter mitigates the effect of drought stress on rice grain yield under field conditions.
    + Physiological analysis indicated that OsTZF5 promoted both drought tolerance and drought avoidance
    + Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that OsTZF5 is a useful biotechnological tool to minimize yield losses in rice grown under drought conditions
    + Expression of OsTZF5 was induced by abscisic acid, dehydration and cold stress
