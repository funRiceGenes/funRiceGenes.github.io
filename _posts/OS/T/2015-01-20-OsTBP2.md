## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System%5BTitle%5D),  We also demonstrate a physical interaction between OsTBP2 and RF2a, a rice bZIP transcription factor that bound to the box II cis element of the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus, resulting in enhanced transcription from the viral promoter
2. __transcription factor__, [Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System%5BTitle%5D),  We conclude that OsTBP2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal transcription factor OsTFIIB and the accessory transcription factor RF2a

## Connection
1. __OsTBP2__, __OsTFIIB__, [Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System%5BTitle%5D),  Recombinant rice TFIIB OsTFIIB stimulated the DNA binding and bending activities of OsTBP2 and synergistically enhanced OsTBP2-mediated transcription from the pal promoter and the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus but not from the barley pr1 promoter
