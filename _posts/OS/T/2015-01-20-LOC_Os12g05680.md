    + The basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP83 and the glutaredoxins OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 facilitate rice iron utilization under the control of OsHRZ ubiquitin ligases.
    + In response to iron deficiency or OsHRZ knockdown, many genes showed differential regulation between the transcript and protein levels, including the TGA-type basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP83
    + Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsGRX9 and OsbZIP83 showed improved tolerance to iron deficiency
    + OsbZIP83 overexpression lines showed enhanced expression of OsYSL2 and OsNAS3, which are involved in internal iron translocation, in addition to OsGRX9 and genes related to phytoalexin biosynthesis and the salicylic acid pathway
