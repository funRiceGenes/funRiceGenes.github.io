* **Key message**  
    + The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
    + In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development
    + A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA
    + Biochemical and chemical biology study of rice OsTAR1 revealed that tryptophan aminotransferase is involved in auxin biosynthesis; identification of a potent OsTAR1 inhibitor, pyruvamine2031.
    + In this study, we obtained biochemical evidence that the rice tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 converts L-tryptophan to IPyA, and has a Km of 82
