* **Key message**  
    + Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
    + However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1

    + __Ehd3__, __OsTrx1~SDG723__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D), We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains
    + __Ghd7__, __OsTrx1~SDG723__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D), However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
    + __Ghd7__, __OsTrx1~SDG723__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D), Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7

    + __OsTrx1~SDG723__, __SIP1__, [SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.%5BTitle%5D), SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
    + __OsTrx1~SDG723__, __SIP1__, [SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we show that the rice TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 is recruited to its target, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), by the C2H2 zinc finger protein SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1)
    + __OsTrx1~SDG723__, __SIP1__, [SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.%5BTitle%5D),  SIP1 binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and interacts with OsTrx1

    + __OsTrx1~SDG723__, __SIP1__, [SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.%5BTitle%5D),  Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
