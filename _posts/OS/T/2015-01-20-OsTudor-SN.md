* **Key message**  
    + Consistent with this view, GFP-tagged OsTudor-SN is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors
    + These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + Normal protein body formation, grain weight, and expression of many genes were partially restored in EM1084 transgenic line complemented with wildtype OsTudor-SN gene
    + Overall, our study showed that OsTudor-SN possesses multiple functional properties in rice storage protein expression and seed development and that the 4SN and Tsn modules have unique roles in these processes
    + The Role of RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development.
    + Transcriptome analysis indicates that OsTudor-SN also functions in regulating gene expression of transcriptional factors and genes involved in developmental processes and stress responses as well as for storage proteins
    + We had previously demonstrated that OsTudor-SN is a key player for transporting storage protein mRNAs to speciÔ¨Åc ER subdomains in developing rice endosperm
