* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsTKPR2  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os01g03670](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g03670)

* **Publication**  
    + [OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, J Exp Bot.

* **Key message**  
    + Thus, our results demonstrated that OsTKPR2 is required for anther and pollen development where an OsTKPR2-containing metabolon is functional during rice sporopollenin synthesis
    + Three independent ostkpr2 mutant lines generated by CRISPR/Cas9 displayed reduced male fertility to various extents which were correlated with the severity of gene disruptions

    + __OsACOS12__, __OsTKPR2__, [OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
    + __OsPKS2__, __OsTKPR2__, [OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
    + __OsTKPR1~OsDFR2~OS-DFR2~OsCCRL1__, __OsTKPR2__, [OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We found that OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 share a similar expression pattern, and their coding proteins have a similar subcellular localization and enzyme activities towards reduced tetraketide α-pyrone and hydroxylated tetraketide α-pyrone
    + __OsTKPR1~OsDFR2~OS-DFR2~OsCCRL1__, __OsTKPR2__, [OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTKPR2 is part of a sporopollenin-producing metabolon required for exine formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were integrated into a metabolon including OsACOS12 and OsPKS2, which resulted in a significant increased enzymatic efficiency when both OsTKPR1 and OsTKPR2 were present, indicating the mutual dependence of OsTKPR2 and OsTKPR1 for their full biochemical activities
