* **Key message**  
    + OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and confers drought tolerance to rice.
    + OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance
    + The expression of OsbZIP42 was induced by ABA treatment, although it was not induced by drought and salt stresses
    + These results suggest that OsbZIP42 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance depending on its activation, which is followed by an additional ABA-dependent modification
    + We propose that OsbZIP42 is an important player in rice for conferring ABA-dependent drought tolerance
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP42 (OsbZIP42-OX) exhibited a rapidly elevated expression of the ABA-responsive LEA3 and Rab16 genes and was hypersensitive to ABA
    + The activation of OsbZIP42 depends on stress-/ABA-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4) and an additional ABA-dependent modification of OsbZIP42
