    + The transcription factor OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.
    + The bHLH TF OsbHLH035 is a salt-induced gene that is primarily expressed in germinating seeds and seedlings
    + Moreover, Osbhlh035 mutant seedlings are unable to recover from salt-stress treatment
    + Consistently, sodium is over-accumulated in aerial tissues but slightly reduced in terrestrial tissues from Osbhlh035 seedlings after salt treatment
    + Furthermore, genetic complementation can restore both the delayed seed germination and the impaired recovery of salt-treated Osbhlh035 seedlings to normal growth
    + OsbHLH035 mediates seed germination and seedling recovery after salt stress relief through the ABA-dependent and ABA-independent activation of OsHKT pathways, respectively
    + Osbhlh035 mutants show delayed seed germination, particularly under salt-stress conditions
    + The expression of OsbHLH035 is induced by drought and salinity
    + In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating Osbhlh035 mutant seeds is downregulated
    + Stable expression of GFP-fused OsbHLH035 in rice transgenic plants revealed that this protein is predominantly localized to the nucleus
    + Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice
    + Our data suggest that OsbHLH35 plays an essential role in anther development in rice and the fine control of its expression is crucial to ensure proper seed production
    + Rice transgenic plants expressing GUS reporter gene under the control of OsbHLH35 promoter (pOsbHLH35::GUS) showed that this TF specifically accumulates in anthers at the meiosis stage and in other spikelet tissues
    + Plants overexpressing OsbHLH35 presented small and curved anthers, leading to a reduction of 72 % on seed production
    + Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35
