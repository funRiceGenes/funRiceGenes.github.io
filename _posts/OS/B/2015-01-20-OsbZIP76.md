* **Key message**  
    + As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
    + Genes involved in endosperm development or starch biosynthesis were prematurely activated in the osbzip76 caryopsis
    + In summary, OsbZIP76 is an endosperm-expressed imprinted gene that regulates endosperm development in rice
    + OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa).
    + OsbZIP76 and OsNF-YB9 were  predominantly expressed in the endosperm and the proteins colocalized
    + OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Seeds of osnf-yb1 and osbzip76 mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content.
