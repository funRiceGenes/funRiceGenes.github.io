* **Key message**  
    + The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress
    + Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion
    + Our demonstration of the important role of Osj10gBTF3 in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants
    + Knockout of Osj10gBTF3 affects pollen and chloroplast development and significantly reduces the accumulation of fertility-related chloroplast protein OsPPR676
    + Interestingly, the interaction between OsHSP82 and OsPPR676 is only found in the cytoplasm, while the interaction between Osj10gBTF3 and OsPPR676 also occurs inside the chloroplast
    + Further investigation indicates that Osj10gBTF3 enters the chloroplast stroma possibly through the inner chloroplast membrane channel protein Tic110 and then recruits OsCpn60 for the folding or assembly of OsPPR676
    + Our results reveal a chaperone role of Osj10gBTF3 in chloroplast import different from Hsp90 and provide a link between chloroplast transport and pollen development in rice
