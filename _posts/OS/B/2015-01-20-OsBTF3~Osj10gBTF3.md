* **Key message**  
    + The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress
    + Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion
    + Our demonstration of the important role of Osj10gBTF3 in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants

    + __OsBTF3~Osj10gBTF3__, __OsPPR676~OsATP4__, [A Plastid-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is Required for Both Pollen Development and Plant Growth in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Plastid-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is Required for Both Pollen Development and Plant Growth in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, OsPPR676 was confirmed to be an interacted protein with Osj10gBTF3, β-subunit of nascent polypeptide-associated complex (β-NAC), by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating that both proteins are probably involved in the same regulatory pathway of pollen development
