    + OsbHLH98 regulates leaf angle in rice through transcriptional repression of OsBUL1.
    + osbhlh98 mutant leaves formed a larger leaf angle, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing OsbHLH98 exhibited a slight reduction in leaf angle
    + We determined that the changes in leaf angle resulted from increased number and size of parenchyma cells on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in osbhlh98 mutants
    + Experiments using reporter constructs showed that OsbHLH98 is expressed on the adaxial side of lamina joints, consistent with its proposed function in regulating leaf angle
    + Our results demonstrate that OsbHLH98 negatively regulates leaf angle by counteracting brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation via the repression of OsBUL1 transcription
    + The characterization of OsbHLH98 and its role in determining leaf angle will lay the foundation to develop the ideal plant architecture for adaptation to high planting density
