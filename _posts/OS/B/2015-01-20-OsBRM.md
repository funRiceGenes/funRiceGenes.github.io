* **Key message**  
    + Here, we constructed ossyd and osbrm mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and analyzed the effects of mutations on rice embryo development
    + We discovered that the ossyd and osbrm mutants exhibited severe defects during embryonic development, whereas endosperm development was normal
    + Collectively, our findings provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsSYD and OsBRM during embryo development in rice
    + Chromatin remodeling ATPases OsSYD and OsBRM are involved in shoot establishment, and both affect OSH gene transcription
