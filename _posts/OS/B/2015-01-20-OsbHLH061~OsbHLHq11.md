* **Key message**  
    + The bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH061 interacts with OsPRI1, and this study used molecular, genetics, biochemical and physiological approaches to functionally characterise OsbHLH061 and how it affects Fe homeostasis
    + OsbHLH061 links TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED repressor proteins with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 to maintain iron homeostasis in rice.
    + OsbHLH061 knockout or overexpression lines increase or decrease Fe accumulation in shoots respectively
    + OsbHLHq11 is expected to increase photosynthetic efficiency by being involved in the chlorophyll content, and is expected to be utilized as a new genetic resource for breeding high-yield rice
    + OsbHLHq11 was finally selected through screening of genes related to chlorophyll content in the RM26981-RM287 region
    + The relative expression level of the gene of OsbHLHq11 was highly expressed in cultivars with low chlorophyll content, and is expected to have a similar function to BHLH62 of the Gramineae genus
