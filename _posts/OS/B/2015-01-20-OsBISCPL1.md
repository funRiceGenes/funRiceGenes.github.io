* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsBISCPL1 in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
    + " Furthermore, the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants also showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress and up-regulated expression of oxidative stress-related genes
    + The results suggest that the OsBISCPL1 may be involved in regulation of defense responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress
    + A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress"
    + OsBISCPL1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice, including roots, stems, leaves and spikes
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression of OsBISCPL1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicated that the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv
    + A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress
