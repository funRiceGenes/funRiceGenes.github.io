## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars%5BTitle%5D)),  The current communication shows a comparative analysis performed on the binding of rice nuclear proteins, together with the purified transcription factor OSBZ8, to the cis-elements in the promoters of Rab16A (Motif I/Motif II), Osem (Motif A-1/Motif B) and Em (4X ABRE/2X ABRC)
