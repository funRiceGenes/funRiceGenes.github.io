* **Key message**  
    + Disease resistance phenotype assays revealed that the OsBIRH1-overexpressing transgenic plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Alternaria brassicicola and Pseudomonas syringae pv
    + Expression of OsBIRH1 was activated in rice seedling leaves after treatment with defence-related signal chemicals, for example benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and jasmonic acid, and was also up-regulated in an incompatible interaction between a resistant rice genotype and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
    + The results suggest that OsBIRH1 encodes a functional DEAD-box RNA helicase and plays important roles in defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses
    + Moreover, the OsBIRH1 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also showed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and elevated expression levels of oxidative defence genes, AtApx1, AtApx2, and AtFSD1
    + OsBIRH1, a DEAD-box RNA helicase with functions in modulating defence responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress
    + The tcd33 seedlings also exhibited less chlorophyll contents and severe defects of chloroplast structure under 20<U+2009>°„C condition
    + A DEAD-box RNA helicase TCD33 that confers chloroplast development in rice at seedling stage under cold stress.
    + The transcript expression level of TCD33 indicated that the genes related to chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and chloroplast development in tcd33 mutants were down-regulated at 20<U+2009>°„C, while the down-regulated genes were nearly recovered to or slightly higher than the WT level at 32<U+2009>°„C
    + Together, our results suggest that the cold-inducible TCD33 is essential for early chloroplast development and is important for cold-responsive gene regulation and cold tolerance in rice
    + Map-based cloning and complementation experiments suggested that TCD33 encodes a chloroplast-located DEAD-box RNA helicase protein
