* **Key message**  
    + We showed that knockout mutants of OsBSK1-1 are less sensitive to BR and exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype, including lower plant height, less tiller number and shortened grain length, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing a gain-of-function dominant mutant form of OsBSK1-1 (OsBSK1-1A295V) are hypersensitive to BR, and exhibit some enhanced BR-responsive phenotypes
    + Together, our results suggest that OsBSK1-1 may serve as a scaffold protein directly bridging OsBRI1 and OsGSK2 to positively regulate BR signalling, thus affecting plant architecture and grain size in rice
    + We found that OsBSK1-1 physically interacts with the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (OsBRI1), and GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE2 (OsGSK2), a downstream component crucial for BR signalling
    + Moreover, we showed that OsBSK1-1 can be phosphorylated by OsBRI1 and can inhibit OsGSK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRASSINOSTEROID RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1)
