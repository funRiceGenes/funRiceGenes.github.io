* **Key message**  
    + Among the Cd-tolerant genes identified, several categories of genes such as BAX inhibitor (BI), NAC transcription factors and Rapid ALkalinization Factors (RALFs) were of particular interest, and their function of Cd tolerance was further validated via heterologous expression, which suggested that SNAC1, RALF12, OsBI-1 can confer Cd tolerance in yeast and tobacco leaves
