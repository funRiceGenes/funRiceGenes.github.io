* **Key message**  
    + Expression of the OsbZIP52 gene was strongly induced by low temperature (4 degrees C) but not by drought, PEG, salt, or ABA
    + OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) family in rice (Oryza sativa) isolated from rice (Zhonghua11) panicles
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP52 showed significantly increased sensitivity to cold and drought stress
    + These results suggest that OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 could function as a negative regulator in cold and drought stress environments
    + bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
