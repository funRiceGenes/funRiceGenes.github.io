* **Key message**  
    + In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots
    + The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type
