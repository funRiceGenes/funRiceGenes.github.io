    + The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.
    + Lines overexpressing OsBLR1 (blr1-D and BLR1-OE-1/2/3) had similar traits, with increased leaf angle and grain length
    + These results suggest that OsBLR1 is involved in BR signal transduction
    + Among the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa), we found an enhancer-trap T-DNA insertion mutant of OsbHLH079 (termed osbhlh079-D)
    + Taking these observations together, we propose that OsbHLH079 functions as a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice
