* **Key message**  
    + We further demonstrated that OsbZIP18 is strongly induced by nitrogen (N) deficiency and that N starvation results in enhanced BCAA levels in an OsbZIP18-dependent manner
    + Here, we identified the basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP18 as a positive regulator of serotonin biosynthesis in rice
    + Overexpression of OsbZIP18 strongly induced the levels of serotonin and its early precursors (tryptophan and tryptamine), resulting in stunted growth and dark-brown phenotypes
