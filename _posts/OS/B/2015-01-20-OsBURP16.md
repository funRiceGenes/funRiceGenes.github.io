## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, ["Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice"%5BTitle%5D)), " All these results suggested that overexpression of OsBURP16 caused pectin degradation and affected cell wall integrity as well as transpiration rate, which decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses
