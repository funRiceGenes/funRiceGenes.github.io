## Information
__Symbol__: OsBi1  
__MSU__: None  
__RAPdb__: None  

## Publication
1. [OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding%5BTitle%5D), 2004, Plant Science.

## Genbank accession number
[AAQ54305](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AAQ54305)  

## Expression information

## Key message
1. __brown planthopper__, [OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding%5BTitle%5D),  Increase in the level of OsBi1 expression was detected in rice plants shortly after brown planthopper feeding
2. __brown planthopper__, [OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding%5BTitle%5D),  Evidences suggest that OsBi1 is a BPH-inducible gene that is implicated in the resistance of rice plants to brown planthopper
