* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsBi1  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding%5BTitle%5D), 2004, Plant Science.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AAQ54305](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AAQ54305)

* **Key message**  
    + Increase in the level of OsBi1 expression was detected in rice plants shortly after brown planthopper feeding
    + Evidences suggest that OsBi1 is a BPH-inducible gene that is implicated in the resistance of rice plants to brown planthopper
