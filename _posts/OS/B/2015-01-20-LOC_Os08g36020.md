* **Key message**  
    + OsBRXL1 and OsBRXL4 were significantly up-regulated by brassinosteroid and auxin, respectively
    + The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
    + Four rice BRX-like genes were predominantly (OsBRXL1, OsBRXL2, and OsBRXL4) or specifically (OsBRXL3) expressed in young panicle
    + OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.
    + Consistent with this, OsBRXL4 regulates the shoot gravitropism through affecting polar auxin transport as did LA1
    + Overexpression of OsBRXL4 leads to a prostrate growth phenotype, whereas OsBRXLs RNAi plants, in which the expression levels of OsBRXL1, OsBRXL4, and OsBRXL5 were decreased, display a compact phenotype
    + Further genetic evidence confirmed that OsBRXL4 controls rice tiller angle by affecting LA1 nuclear localization
    + Therefore, our study not only identifies OsBRXL4 as a regulatory component of rice tiller angle, but also provides a new insight into our understanding of rice plant architecture
    + We showed that the interaction between OsBRXL4 and LA1 occurs at the plasma membrane and that their interaction determines LA1 nuclear localization
