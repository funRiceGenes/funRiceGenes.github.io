* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening
    + OsBC1L6 mRNA was expressed in ripening seeds during endosperm enlargement
