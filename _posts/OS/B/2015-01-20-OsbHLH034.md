* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of jasmonate-responsive OsbHLH034 in rice results in the induction of bacterial blight resistance via an increase in lignin biosynthesis
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight
    + OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells
    + The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment
    + These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice
