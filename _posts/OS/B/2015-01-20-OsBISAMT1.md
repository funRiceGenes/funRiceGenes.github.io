## Key message
1. __disease__, [OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance
2. __disease__, [OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses%5BTitle%5D)),  The results suggest that OsBISAMT1 may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice
