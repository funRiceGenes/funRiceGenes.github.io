* **Key message**  
    + OsBT1-3 expression was high in the young leaves, decreased after the two-leaf stage, and was low in the sheath, and these findings are consistent with the recovery of a number of chloroplasts in the third leaf of sla mutant seedlings
    + Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage
    + The results also showed that OsBT1-3-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was targeted to the chloroplast, and a Western blot assay using a peptide-specific antibody indicated that OsBT1-3 localizes to the chloroplast envelope
    + We also demonstrated that OsBT1-3 functions as a unidirectional transporter of adenine nucleotides
