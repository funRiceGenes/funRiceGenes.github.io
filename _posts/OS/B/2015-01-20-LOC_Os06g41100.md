    + Transcription Factor OsbZIP49 Controls Tiller Angle and Plant Architecture through the Induction of Indole-3-acetic Acid-amido Synthetases in Rice.
    + Taken together, the present results reveal the role transcription factor OsbZIP49 plays in determining plant architecture, primarily due to its influence on local auxin homeostasis
    + Follow-up studies indicated that the effects of OsbZIP49 on tiller angles are mediated through changes in shoot gravitropic responses
    + Knockout of OsbZIP49 led to reduced expression of both OsGH3-2 and OsGH3-13 within the shoot base, and increased accumulation of IAA and increased OsIAA20 expression levels were observed in transformants following gravistimulation
    + In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of OsbZIP49 resulted in a compact architecture
    + Increased GH3-catalysed conjugation of IAA in rice transformants overexpressing OsbZIP49 resulted in the increased accumulation of IAA-Asp and IAA-Glu, and a reduction in local free auxin, tryptamine and IAA-Glc levels
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP49 displayed a tiller-spreading phenotype with reduced plant height and internode lengths
