* **Key message**  
    + These results demonstrate a conserved function of OsBZR1 and an important role of 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in rice
    + Functions of OsBZR1 and 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signaling in rice
    + To understand the downstream BR signaling mechanism in rice, we studied the function of OsBZR1 using reverse genetic approaches and identified OsBZR1-interacting proteins
    + Suppressing OsBZR1 expression by RNAi resulted in dwarfism, erect leaves, reduced BR sensitivity, and altered BR-responsive gene expression in transgenic rice plants, demonstrating an essential role of OsBZR1 in BR responses in rice
    + Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element
    + We reported that DGS1 plays a positive role in regulating grain size in rice and was regulated by OsBZR1
    + OsBZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1), a core transcription activator of BR signaling, also plays a positive role in grain size
    + The histone deacetylase HDA703 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate rice brassinosteroid signaling, growth and heading date through repression of Ghd7 expression
    + We further show that GRAIN NUMBER, PLANT HEIGHT, and HEADING DATE 7 (Ghd7), a central regulator of growth, development, and the stress response, is a direct target of OsBZR1
    + We also show that HDA703 is a direct target of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1), a primary regulator of rice BR signaling, and HDA703 interacts with OsBZR1 in rice
    + Together, our study suggests that HDA703, a histone H4 deacetylase, interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate rice BR signaling, growth, and heading date through epigenetic regulation of Ghd7
    + Moreover, cellular ammonium contents, 15NH4 + uptake, and the regulatory effect of methyl-ammonium on root growth are strongly dependent on the levels of BZR1
    + qGL3/OsPPKL1 Induces Phosphorylation of 14-3-3 OsGF14b to Inhibit OsBZR1 Function in Brassinosteroid Signaling
    + Genetic and molecular analyses indicated that OsGF14b functions as a negative regulator in BR signaling and represses the transcriptional activation activity of OsBZR1
    + OsGSK2 deacetylation attenuated the interaction between OsGSK2 and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1), leading to accumulation of OsBZR1
    + Although BZR1 is known to regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signalling, the observation that BR signalling negatively regulated resistance to ShB indicated an independent role for BZR1 in controlling rice resistance
    + Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB
    + It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB
