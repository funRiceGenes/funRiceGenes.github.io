* **Key message**  
    + In this study, three rice basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (OsbZIP39, OsbZIP50 and OsbZIP60) containing putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) in their C-terminal regions were identified as candidates of the ER stress sensor transducer
    + A rice transmembrane bZIP transcription factor, OsbZIP39, regulates the endoplasmic reticulum stress response
