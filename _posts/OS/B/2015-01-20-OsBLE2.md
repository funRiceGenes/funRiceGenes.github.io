## Key message
1. __vascular bundle__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE2 expressed more, as revealed by in situ hybridization, in vascular bundles and root primordia, where the cells are actively undergoing division, elongation, and differentiation
2. __sheath__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings
3. __leaf__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings
4. __seedling__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings
5. __growth__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE2 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth
6. __growth__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsBLE2 is involved in BL-regulated growth and development processes in rice
7. __BR signaling__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  BL could not enhance its expression in transgenic rice expressing antisense BRI1, a BR receptor, indicating that BR signaling to the enhanced expression of OsBLE2 is through BRI1
8. __root__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE2 expressed more, as revealed by in situ hybridization, in vascular bundles and root primordia, where the cells are actively undergoing division, elongation, and differentiation
9. __lamina__, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings
10. __ BR __, [A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  BL could not enhance its expression in transgenic rice expressing antisense BRI1, a BR receptor, indicating that BR signaling to the enhanced expression of OsBLE2 is through BRI1
