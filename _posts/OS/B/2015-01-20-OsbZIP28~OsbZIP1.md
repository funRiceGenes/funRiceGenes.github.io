* **Key message**  
    + Northern blotting analysis showed thatOsbZIP1 was constitutively expressed in the roots and strongly induced in rice leaves in response to infection with both the compatible race MS220 and incompatible race 131 ofM
    + Furthermore, OsbZIP1 expression could be rapidly induced in leaves treated with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid
    + These results indicate that the OsbZIP1 may function as a transcription factor and may play a role in salicylic acid-dependent signal transduction pathway for defense of rice against pathogens
