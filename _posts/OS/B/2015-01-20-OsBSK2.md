* **Key message**  
    + OsBSK2 directly interacts with the BR receptor kinase OsBRI1, however, genetic experiments have demonstrated that OsBSK2 likely regulates grain size independently of the BR signaling pathway
    + OsBSK2 can form a homodimer or heterodimers with OsBSK3 and OsBSK4, and silencing OsBSK2, OsBSK3, and OsBSK4 reduced grain size
    + MutMap-based gene mapping and transgenic experiments demonstrated that GLW10 encodes a putative brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling kinase, OsBSK2
    + OsBSK2 is a plasma membrane protein, and an N-myristoylation site is needed for both its membrane localization and functions
    + Finally, we determined that OsBSK2 is involved in a number of divergent traits in japonica relative to indica rice, including grain shape, tiller number, cold adaptation, and nitrogen-use efficiency
    + OsBSK2(L13) in indica plays a greater role in BR signaling than OsBSK2(P13) in japonica by affecting the auto-binding and protein accumulation of OsBSK2
    + Our study suggests that the natural variation in OsBSK2 plays a key role in the divergence of BR signaling, which underlies multiple divergent traits between japonica and indica
