## Key message
1. __cell elongation__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA
2. __shoot apical meristem__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
3. __growth__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants
4. __growth__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice
5. __iaa__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA
6. __auxin__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin
7. __ BR __, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice
8. __ BR __, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin
9. __meristem__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
10. __shoot__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
11. __root__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment

## Connection
1. __D61~OsBRI1__, __OsBLE3__, [OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In OsBRI1 antisense transgenic rice and OsBLE3, the BR-insensitive mutant expression of OsBLE3 in response to exogenous BL treatment was significantly lower compared to that in control plants transformed with a vacant vector
