* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA
    + In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue
    + Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants
    + OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice
    + These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin
    + To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice
    + The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment
