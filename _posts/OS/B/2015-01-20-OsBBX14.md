* **Key message**  
    + OsBBX14 is highly expressed in flag leaf blades
    + Thus, OsBBX14 acts as a floral repressor by promoting Hd1 expression under LD conditions, probably because of crosstalk with the circadian clock
    + OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice
    + OsBBX14-overexpression (OsBBX14-OX) lines exhibited delayed heading date under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions, whereas RNAi lines of OsBBX14 lines had similar heading dates to the WT
    + Our findings suggested that OsBBX14 regulates heading date differently under LD and SD conditions
    + OsBBX14 is located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation potential
