* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsBP-73  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g08480](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g08480)

* **Publication**  
    + [OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth%5BTitle%5D), 2003, Plant Mol Biol.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AJ315791](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AJ315791)

* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed
    + Genetic interference of OsBP-73 gene expression by double-stranded RNA strikingly inhibits the whole plant growth but does not affect the passage from the juvenile to adult phase
    + OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth
