* **Key message**  
    + The osbt1 mutant showed a white-core endosperm and a significantly lower grain weight than the wild-type
    + The formation and development of compound starch granules in osbt1 was obviously defective: the amyloplast was disintegrated at early developmental stages and the starch granules were disperse and not compound in the endosperm cells in the centre region of osbt1 seeds
    + OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.
    + Furthermore, the expression of starch synthesis related genes was also altered in the osbt1 mutant
    + These findings indicate that OsBT1 plays an important role in starch synthesis and the formation of compound starch granules
    + Map-based cloning of OsBT1 indicated that it encodes a putatively ADP-glucose transporter
