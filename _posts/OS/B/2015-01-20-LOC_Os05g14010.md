* **Key message**  
    + We report that OsbHLH073 participates in regulating plant height, internode elongation, and panicle exsertion by regulating GA biosynthesis associated with the OsKO1 and OsKO2 genes
    + OsbHLH073 Negatively Regulates Internode Elongation and Plant Height by Modulating GA Homeostasis in Rice.
    + Yeast two-hybrid and localization assays showed that the OsbHLH073 protein is a nuclear localized-transcriptional activator
