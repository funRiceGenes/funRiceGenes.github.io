* **Key message**  
    + Besides, OsbHLH96 might interact with Jasmonate Zim-Domain3 (OsJAZ3)
    + Loss-of-function mutations of OsbHLH044 transcription factor lead to salinity sensitivity and a greater chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + The expression levels of genes coding for starch (OsAGPL1, OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) and seed storage proteins (GluA1 and Globulin 1) were significantly decreased, indicating that they synthesize less store starch and proteins, resulting in grain chalkiness in the osbhlh044 (OsHKT1;3, OsHAK7, OsSOS1, OsSOS2, OsNHX2, and OsLEA3 but not OsHKT2;1), and starch-related genes (OsSSIIa, OsWx, and OsFLO2) by binding to the G-boxes of their promoters
    + Therefore, the OsbHLH044 gene editing mutants revealed multiple functions, specifically a positive regulator of salt stress and grain quality, which might bring new insights into the breeding of rice varieties
    + Notably, the osbhlh044 mutants resulted in prominently reduced morphological and physiological parameters under salt stress
    + Moreover, the expression of ion homeostasis-related genes (OsHKTs, OsHAK, OsSOSs, and OsNHX) and ABA-responsive gene (OsLEA3) was significantly altered in the osbhlh044 mutants after salt stress
    + Lower antioxidant activities and higher lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation in the osbhlh044 mutants caused salinity sensitivity due to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS)
    + Under salt stress, both shoots and roots of the osbhlh044 mutants acquired higher Na(+)
