    + A stress-responsive bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP62 improves drought and oxidative tolerance in rice.
    + Overexpression of OsbZIP62-VP64 (OsbZIP62V) enhanced the drought tolerance and oxidative stress tolerance of transgenic rice, while osbzip62 mutants exhibited the opposite phenotype
    + OsbZIP62 is involved in ABA signalling pathways and positively regulates rice drought tolerance by regulating the expression of genes associated with stress, and this gene could be used for the genetic modification of crops with improved drought tolerance
    + OsbZIP62 expression was induced by drought, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + Moreover, OsbZIP62 could bind to the promoters of several putative target genes and could interact with stress/ABA-activated protein kinases (SAPKs)
