* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsbZIP79 functions as a negative regulator of phytoalexin production triggered by a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in rice cells, although it remains open under which conditions OsbZIP79 can work with OsTGAP1.
    + Among the OsTGAP1-interacting protein candidates, a TGA factor OsbZIP79 was investigated to verify its physical interaction with OsTGAP1 and involvement in the regulation of phytoalexin production.
