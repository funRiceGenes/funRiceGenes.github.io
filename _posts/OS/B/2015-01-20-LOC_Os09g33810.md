    + Moreover, the accumulation of XB25 is induced by Xoo infection
    + The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage
    + Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance
    + The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance
    + Molecular characterization of rice OsBIANK1, encoding a plasma membrane-anchored ankyrin repeat protein, and its inducible expression in defense responses
    + Expression of OsBIANK1 was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical inducer capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice
    + Our preliminary results confirm previous evidences that OsBIANK1 may be involved in regulation of disease resistance response in rice
    + In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIANK1 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings
