* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark grown rice and Athy5 seedlings complemented with OsbZIP48, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5
    + The RNAi lines and T-DNA insertional mutant of OsbZIP48 showed seedling lethal phenotype despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development
    + In comparison to AtHY5, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when over-expressed in Arabidopsis, the over-expression of full-length OsbZIP48 in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably
