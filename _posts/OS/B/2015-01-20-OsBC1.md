* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size
    + Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177 and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation
