    + Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) staining further indicated that OsBAG3 is mainly involved in primary young tissues under both primary and secondary growth
    + The co-expression analysis and the hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the OsBAG1 and OsBAG3 were co-expressed with primary cell wall-biosynthesizing genes, OsBAG4 was co-expressed with phytohormone and transcriptional factors, and OsBAG6 was co-expressed with disease and shock-associated genes
