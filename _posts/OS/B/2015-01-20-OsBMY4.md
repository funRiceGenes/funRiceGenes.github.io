* **Key message**  
    + Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance
    + In this study, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, the key β-amylase and debranching enzymes that control transient starch degradation in rice leaves, were co-overexpressed in rice in order to accelerate starch degradation efficiency and increase the sugar supply for sink organs
    + Moreover, since the OsBMY4 gene has not been characterized, we generated osbmy4 mutants using CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing, which helped to reveal the roles of β-amylase in rice yield and quality
