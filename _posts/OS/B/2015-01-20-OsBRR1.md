* **Key message**  
    + OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus (Ken 54-04) and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment
    + In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) strategy was used to specifically knockdown 59 individual rice genes encoding putative LRR-RLKs, and a novel rice blast resistance-related gene (designated as OsBRR1) was identified by screening T(0) RNAi population using a weakly virulent isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae, Ken 54-04
    + These results indicate that OsBRR1 is involved in rice resistance responses to blast fungus and mediates resistance to rice blast
    + A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance
