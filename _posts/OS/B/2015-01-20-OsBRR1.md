## Key message
1. __growth__, [A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance%5BTitle%5D),  OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus Ken 54-04 and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment
2. __blast__, [A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, RNA interference RNAi strategy was used to specifically knockdown 59 individual rice genes encoding putative LRR-RLKs, and a novel rice blast resistance-related gene designated as OsBRR1 was identified by screening T0 RNAi population using a weakly virulent isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae, Ken 54-04
3. __blast__, [A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance%5BTitle%5D),  OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus Ken 54-04 and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment
