* **Key message**  
    + Cell-type specificity of the expression of Os BOR1, a rice efflux boron transporter gene, is regulated in response to boron availability for efficient boron uptake and xylem loading.
    + The OsBOR1 protein shows polar localization at the distal side of bundle sheath cells in nodes and xylem parenchyma cells of elongating leaf sheath, but at the proximal side of bundle sheath in the mature leaf sheath and blade
    + These results indicate that OsBOR1 expressed in nodes and leaf sheath is involved in the proper distribution of B to different tissues in rice
    + OsBOR1 was highly expressed in the nodes at all growth stages
