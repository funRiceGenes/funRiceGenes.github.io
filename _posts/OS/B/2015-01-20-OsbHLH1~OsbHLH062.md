* **Key message**  
    + The transcription of the OsbHLH1 gene was specifically induced in roots of rice seedlings by cold but not by NaCl, PEG and ABA treatments
    + A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response
    + These results indicate that the OsbHLH1 may function as a transcription factor in a cold signal-transduction pathway
    + OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain
    + OsbHLH062 can bind to an E-box in the promoters of the ion transporter genes such as OsHAK21, and most of these ion transporter genes are responsive to JA treatment
