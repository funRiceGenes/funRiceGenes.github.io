* **Key message**  
    + Protein interaction assays showed OsbZIP47 partnerships with RICE HOMEOBOX1 (OSH1), RICE FLORICULA/LEAFY (RFL), and OsMADS1 transcription factors
    + OsbZIP47 Is an Integrator for Meristem Regulators During Rice Plant Growth and Development.
    + We characterized the role of rice OsbZIP47 in vegetative and reproductive development
    + Taken together, we provide insights on OsbZIP47 roles in SAM development, inflorescence branching, and floret development
