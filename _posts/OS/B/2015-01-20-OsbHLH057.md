* **Key message**  
    + Using a DNA pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor OsbHLH057 was determined to interact with the AATCA cis-element
    + OsbHLH057 targets the AATCA cis-element to regulate disease resistance and drought tolerance in rice.
    + OsbHLH057 bound to the motif to positively regulate rice disease resistance and drought tolerance
    + Furthermore, overexpressing OsbHLH057 enhanced rice disease resistance and drought tolerance, while knocking out OsbHLH057 made rice more susceptible to pathogens and drought
