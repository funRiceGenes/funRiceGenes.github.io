* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsbZIP71 was strongly induced by drought, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ABA treatments, but repressed by salt treatment
    + OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice
    + OsbZIP71 overexpressing (p35S::OsbZIP71) rice significantly improved tolerance to drought, salt and PEG osmotic stresses
    + These results suggest that OsbZIP71 may play an important role in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerance in rice
    + Inducible expression (RD29A::OsbZIP71) lines were significantly improved their tolerance to PEG osmotic stresses, but hypersensitivity to salt, and insensitivity to ABA

* **Connection**  
    + __OsbZIP71__, __OsNHX1__, [OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D), Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that OsbZIP71 directly binds the promoters of OsNHX1 and COR413-TM1 in vivo
