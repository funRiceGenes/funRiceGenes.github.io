10. __LIC~OsLIC1__, __OsBZR1__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels
