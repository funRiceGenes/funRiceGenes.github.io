* **Key message**  
    + These results demonstrate a conserved function of OsBZR1 and an important role of 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in rice
    + Functions of OsBZR1 and 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signaling in rice
    + To understand the downstream BR signaling mechanism in rice, we studied the function of OsBZR1 using reverse genetic approaches and identified OsBZR1-interacting proteins
    + Suppressing OsBZR1 expression by RNAi resulted in dwarfism, erect leaves, reduced BR sensitivity, and altered BR-responsive gene expression in transgenic rice plants, demonstrating an essential role of OsBZR1 in BR responses in rice
    + Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element
