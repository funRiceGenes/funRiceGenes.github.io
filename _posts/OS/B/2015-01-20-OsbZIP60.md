* **Key message**  
    + Finally, yeast two-hybrid screening results showed that Bphi008a is able to interact with a b-ZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP60) and a RNA polymerase polypeptide (SDRP)
    + Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) reveals that the transcription factor OsbZIP60 is a vital regulator of rice grain chalkiness
    + Genetic analysis demonstrates that knockout of OsbZIP60 results in extremely high grain chalkiness and aberrant structure of storage substances
    + Furthermore, OsbZIP60 is found to activate the expression of key genes related to grain chalkiness, such as GPA3, FSE1, FLO7, Chalk5, OsNF-YB1, and OsPK2, whose expression is significantly suppressed in osbzip60 and overexpression lines of OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2, and OsBiP3
    + Our study provides novel insights into the function of OsbZIP60 and the role of the UPR pathway in the formation of grain chalkiness in rice
