* **Key message**  
    + By knocking out the OsbZIP14 gene in the rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, we observed that the knockout mutant OsbZIP14 exhibited dwarfism with reduced tiller during the grain-filling stage
    + Our results suggested that OsbZIP14 acts as a key TF gene through the concerted action of OsbZIP58 and OsbZIP14 during rice filling under heat stress
    + Under high-temperature treatment, it was also demonstrated that in the OsbZIP14 mutant, the expression of the OsbZIP58 gene, a key regulator of rice seed storage protein (SSP) accumulation, was upregulated
