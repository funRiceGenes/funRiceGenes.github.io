* **Key message**  
    + In conclusion, this study identified OsBBX11 as a salt-tolerance gene, and one SNPs in the OsBBX11 promoter region can be used to identify its interacting transcription factors
    + Transgenic plants using knockout-based technology and demonstrated that Na(+) and K(+) in the roots of the functional-loss-type OsBBX11 were translocated largely to the leaves under 120 mmol/L NaCl compared with the wild-type, causing osbbx11 leaves to die after 12 days of salt stress due to an imbalance in osmotic pressure
    + OsBBX11 on qSTS4 links to salt tolerance at the seeding stage in Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica.
    + This provides a theoretical basis for finding the molecular mechanism of OsBBX11 upstream and downstream regulation of salt tolerance and molecular design breeding in the future
