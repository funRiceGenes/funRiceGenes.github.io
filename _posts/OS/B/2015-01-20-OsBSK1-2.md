* **Key message**  
    + Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling
    + Our study reveals that OsBSK1-2 functions as a major regulator in rice plant immunity
