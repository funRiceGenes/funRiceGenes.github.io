    + OsBIC1 Directly Interacts with OsCRYs to Regulate Leaf Sheath Length through Mediating GA-Responsive Pathway.
    + The overexpression of OsBIC1 and OsBIC2 led to increased leaf sheath length, whereas mutations in OsBIC1 displayed shorter leaf sheath in a blue light intensity-dependent manner
    + OsBIC1 regulated blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through direct interaction with OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b, and OsCRY2 (OsCRYs)
    + Longitudinal sections of the second leaf sheath demonstrated that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs controlled leaf sheath length by influencing the ratio of epidermal cells with different lengths
    + Taken together, these results suggested that OsBIC1 and OsCRYs worked together to regulate epidermal cell elongation and control blue light-induced leaf sheath elongation through the GA-responsive pathway
