* **Publication**  
    + [OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Plant Cell Rep.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Both OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 were induced by treatments with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), and defense-related hormones, such as methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid
    + OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 are induced by biotic stress and defense-related hormones
    + OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK belonging to Group C and directly phosphorylates OsbHLH65 in the nucleus
    + In the study reported here, we determined that a TEY-type rice MAPK belonging to subgroup C, named OsMPK3, phosphorylates its substrate OsbHLH65 in the nucleus
