* **Key message**  
    + Here, we characterized the function of a rice bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP16 in drought stress
    + Basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP16 positively regulates drought resistance in rice
    + At both the seedling and tillering stages, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP16 exhibited significantly improved drought resistance, which was positively correlated with the observed expression levels of OsbZIP16
    + Expression of OsbZIP16 was dramatically induced under drought conditions
    + Overall, our findings suggest that OsbZIP16 positively regulates drought resistance in rice
    + OsbZIP16 was shown to be induced by exogenous ABA treatment, while overexpression of OsbZIP16 was observed to make transgenic plants more sensitive to ABA than wild type plants were
