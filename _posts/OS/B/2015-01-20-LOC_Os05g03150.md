* **Key message**  
    + OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression
    + OsBLE1 expressed mainly in active tissues such as vascular bundles and root primordial
    + Results suggest that OsBLE1 might be involved in BL-regulated growth processes in rice seedlings
    + Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings
    + Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE1 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth
