## Key message
1. __cell wall__, [Identification of transcription factors involved in rice secondary cell wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of transcription factors involved in rice secondary cell wall formation%5BTitle%5D),  Further analyses were performed for the OsMYB55/61 and OsBLH6 TFs, the former being a TF in which the Arabidopsis ortholog is known to participate in lignin biosynthesis AtMYB61 and the latter being one for which no previous involvement in cell wall formation has been reported even in Arabidopsis BLH6)  
2. __cell wall__, [Identification of transcription factors involved in rice secondary cell wall formation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of transcription factors involved in rice secondary cell wall formation%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, expression of a reporter gene driven by the OsCAD2 promoter was enhanced in rice calli when OsMYB55/61 or OsBLH6 was transiently expressed, demonstrating that they function in secondary cell wall formation
