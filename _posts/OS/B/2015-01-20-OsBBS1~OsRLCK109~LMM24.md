    + A guanine insert in OsBBS1 leads to early leaf senescence and salt stress sensitivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Transgenic LOC_Os03g24930 knockout plants generated by a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy exhibited similar early leaf senescence phenotypes as did the bbs1 mutant, which confirmed that LOC_Os03g24930 was the OsBBS1 gene
    + The OsBBS1 gene was cloned by a map-based cloning strategy, and a guanine (G) insertion was found in the first exon of LOC_Os03g24930
    + The expression of OsBBS1 could be greatly induced by salt stress, and the bbs1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to salt stress
    + Chloroplast degradation was observed in lmm24 leaves, with decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes and increased expression of the senescence-induced STAYGREEN (SGR) gene and other senescence-associated genes
    + The lmm24 mutant displayed dark brown lesions in leaves and growth retardation that were not observed in wild-type ZH8015
    + Furthermore, lmm24 exhibited enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M
    + LMM24 Encodes Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase 109, Which Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses in Rice.
    + Our data demonstrate that LMM24 regulates cell death and defense responses in rice
    + The results of histochemical staining and TUNEL assays showed enhanced ROS accumulation and cell death in lmm24
    + The LMM24 gene was identified by MutMap, and LMM24 was confirmed as a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase 109 by amino acid sequence analysis
    + We identified a new rice lesion mimic mutant lmm24 from a mutant pool of indica rice cultivar &quot;ZhongHui8015&quot;
