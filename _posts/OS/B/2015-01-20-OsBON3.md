* **Key message**  
    + In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth
    + Knockdown of OsBON1 and dominant negative mutant of OsBON3 enhanced resistance to rice bacterial and fungal pathogens with either hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic life styles
    + Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.
    + However, neither OsBON1 nor OsBON3 could rescue the dwarf phenotype of the Arabidopsis BON1 knockout mutant, suggesting an evolutionary divergence of the rice and Arabidopsis copine genes
    + Both OsBON1 and OsBON3 changed their protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge
    + Here, we show that the rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 are critical suppressors of immunity
