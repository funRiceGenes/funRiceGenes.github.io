* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsbZIP72 plays a positive role in drought resistance through ABA signaling, and is potential useful for engineering drought tolerant rice
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP72 showed a hypersensitivity to ABA, elevated levels of expression of ABA response gene such as LEAs, and an enhanced ability of drought tolerance
    + Identification of OsbZIP72 as a positive regulator of ABA response and drought tolerance in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __OsABF1~OsABI5~OREB1~OsbZIP10__, __OsbZIP72__, [The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway
