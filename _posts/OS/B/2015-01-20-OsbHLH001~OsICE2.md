## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cold stress__, [Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation%5BTitle%5D)), " In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2"

## Connection
1. __OsbHLH001~OsICE2__, __OsICE1__, [Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation%5BTitle%5D)),  These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively
