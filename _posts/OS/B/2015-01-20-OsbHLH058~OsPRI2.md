    + OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.
    + Subgroup IVc basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in rice in a similar but distinct manner, putatively under partial control by OsHRZs
    + Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsbHLH058 showed tolerance for iron deficiency and higher iron concentration in seeds
    + In the present study, we investigated the functions of OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 related to iron deficiency response
    + OsbHLH058 expression was repressed under iron deficiency, whereas the expression of OsbHLH057 and OsbHLH060 was moderately induced
    + Conversely, OsbHLH058 knockdown lines showed susceptibility to iron deficiency and reduced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes
    + These results indicate that OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in a similar but distinct manner, and that this function may be partially controlled by OsHRZs
