* **Key message**  
    + To understand their possible involvement in stomatal formation, in this study we generated a series of transgenic lines including reporter promoter fusions, down-regulation and overexpression and demonstrated drastic differences in stomatal densities between different genotypes, as elevated expression of OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 greatly reduced stomatal density in rice, whereas ectopic overexpression of either OsEPF1 or OsEPF2 significantly decreased the high stomatal frequency of both mutant lines of epf2 and epf1epf2 Arabidopsis
