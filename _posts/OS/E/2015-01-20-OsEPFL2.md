* **Key message**  
    + OsEPFL2 is strongly expressed in the young panicle, consistent with a role in regulating awn and grain development
    + Loss of function of most OsEPF/EPFL genes generated no obvious phenotype alteration, whilst disruption of OsEPFL2 in Kasalath caused a short or no awn phenotype and reduced grain size
    + Nucleotide diversity and genetic differentiation analyses suggested that OsEPFL2 was positively selected during the domestication of rice
