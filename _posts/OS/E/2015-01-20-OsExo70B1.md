* **Key message**  
    + OsExo70B1 mainly expresses in leaf and shoot and its expression is induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M
    + OsExo70B1 Positively Regulates Disease Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice
    + Knocking out OsExo70B1 results in significantly decreased resistance and defense responses to M
    + Taken together, our data demonstrate that OsExo70B1 functions as an important regulator in rice immunity
    + Furthermore, OsExo70B1 can interact with the receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, an essential component for chitin reception in rice
