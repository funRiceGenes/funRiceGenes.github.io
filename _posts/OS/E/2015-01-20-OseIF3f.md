* **Publication**  
    + [The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit f OseIF3f Is Involved in Microgametogenesis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit f OseIF3f Is Involved in Microgametogenesis.%5BTitle%5D), 2016, Front Plant Sci.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Subcellular localization analysis showed that OseIF3f was localized to the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum in rice root cells
    + The OseIF3f-RNAi lines grew normally at the vegetative stage but displayed a large reduction in seed production and pollen viability, which is associated with the down-regulation of OseIF3f
