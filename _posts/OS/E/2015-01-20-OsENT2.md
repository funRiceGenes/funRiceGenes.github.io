## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D),  The OsENT2 promoter drove the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene in the scutellum during germination and in vascular tissues in germinated plants, suggesting a participation of OsENT2 in the retrieval of endosperm-derived nucleosides by the germinating embryo and in the long-distance transport of nucleosides in growing plants, respectively
2. __resistant__, ["Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport"%5BTitle%5D), " OsENT2-mediated adenosine transport was resistant to the typical inhibitors of mammalian ENTs, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, dilazep, and dipyridamole"
3. __growth__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D),  Growth analysis of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing OsENTs showed that OsENT2 transported adenosine and uridine with high affinity adenosine, Km = 3
4. __cytokinin__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D),  In competition experiments with various cytokinins, adenosine transport by OsENT2 was inhibited by isopentenyladenine riboside iPR)  
5. __cytokinin__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D),  Direct measurements with radiolabeled cytokinins demonstrated that OsENT2 mediated uptake of iPR Km = 32 microm and trans-zeatin riboside Km = 660 microm), suggesting that OsENT2 participates in iPR transport in planta
6. __cytokinin__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D), Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport
7. __transporter__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D), Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport
8. __root__, [Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport%5BTitle%5D),  In mature plants, OsENT2 was predominantly expressed in roots
