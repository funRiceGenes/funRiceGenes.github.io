    + CURLED LATER1 encoding the largest subunit of the Elongator complex has a unique role in leaf development and meristem function in rice
    + The shoot apical meristem (SAM) was small and the leaf initiation rate was low, suggesting that the activity of the SAM seemed to be partially reduced in cur1.
    + OsEDM2L interacts with the transcription factors bHLH142 and TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION to regulate the expression of ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 (EAT1), a positive regulator of tapetal PCD
    + The osedm2l knockout mutant showed delayed tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and defective pollen development
    + Therefore, OsEDM2L is indispensable for proper mRNA m6 A modification in rice anther development
    + OsEDM2L mediates m 6 A of EAT1 transcript for proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation regulating rice tapetal degradation
    + Mutation of OsEDM2L altered the transcriptomic m6 A landscape, and caused a distinct m6 A modification of the EAT1 transcript leading to dysregulation of its alternative splicing and polyadenylation, followed by suppression of the EAT1 target genes OsAP25 and OsAP37 for tapetal PCD
