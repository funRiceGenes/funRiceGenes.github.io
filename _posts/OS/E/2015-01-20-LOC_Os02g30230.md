* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsExo70-F2  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os02g30230](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g30230)

* **Publication**  
    + [Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii, and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii, and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Simultaneous knockdown of OsExo70-F2 and F3 totally abrogated Pii immune receptor-dependent resistance, but had no effect on Pia- and Pik-dependent resistance
    + Knockdown levels of OsExo70-F3 but not OsExo70-F2 correlated with reduction of Pii function, suggesting that OsExo70-F3 is specifically involved in Pii-dependent resistance
