* **Key message**  
    + OsEXPA7 was highly expressed in the shoot apical meristem, root, and the leaf sheath
    + Morphological analysis revealed structural alterations in the root and leaf vasculature of OsEXPA7 overexpressing (OX) lines
    + In this study, we evaluated the function of OsEXPA7 involved in salt stress tolerance
    + Phenotypic analysis showed that OsEXPA7 overexpression remarkably enhanced tolerance to salt stress
    + These results suggest that OsEXPA7 plays an important role in increasing salt stress tolerance by coordinating sodium transport, ROS scavenging, and cell-wall loosening
    + OsEXPA7 overexpression resulted in decreased sodium ion (Na+) and accumulated potassium ion (K+) in the leaves and roots
