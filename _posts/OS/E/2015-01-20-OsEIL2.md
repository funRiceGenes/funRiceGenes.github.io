* **Key message**  
    + In rice, however, lack of MHZ6/OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 functions improves salt tolerance, whereas the overexpression lines exhibits salt hypersensitivity at seedling stage, indicating that MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 negatively regulate salt tolerance in rice
    + MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 Regulate Ethylene Response of Roots and Coleoptiles and Negatively Affect Salt Tolerance in Rice.
    + Disruption of MHZ6/OsEIL1 caused ethylene insensitivity mainly in roots, whereas silencing of the closely-related OsEIL2 led to ethylene insensitivity mainly in coleoptiles of etiolated seedlings
    + Together, our study provides insights for functional diversification of MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in ethylene response and finds a novel mode of ethylene-regulated salt stress response which could be helpful for engineering salt-tolerant crops
    + Furthermore, this negative regulation by MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in salt tolerance is likely in part attributable to the direct regulation of OsHKT2;1 expression and Na+ uptake in roots
    + Transgenic plants of overexpressing OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) show reduced tolerance to salt and drought stress compared with the controls
    + Taken together, these results revealed a new mechanism of OsEIL2 in abiotic stress responses
    + OsEIL2 is a nuclear-localized protein with transactivation activity in the C-terminus (amino acids 344-583) and can be induced by NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), dark, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
