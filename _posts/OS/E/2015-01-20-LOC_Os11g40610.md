* **Key message**  
    + Unlike OsLUX, loss OsELF4a displayed a marginal influence under short-day (SD) condition, but markedly delayed flowering time under long-day (LD) condition
    + OsLUX combined with OsELF4a and OsELF3a or OsELF3b to form two ECs, of which the OsLUX-OsELF3a-OsELF4a was likely the dominant promoter for photoperiodic flowering
    + In addition, OsELF4a was also essential for promoting rice flowering
