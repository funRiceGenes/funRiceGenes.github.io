* **Key message**  
    + Here, we identified an S-domain receptor-like kinase OsESG1 from rice (Oryza sativa), and identified its involvement in early crown root (CR) development and drought response
    + Results above suggested that OsESG1 may regulate CR initiation and development by controlling auxin response and distribution, and participate in stress response by regulating the activities of antioxidants and expressions of stress-regulated genes
    + The OsESG1 kinase domain possessed auto-phosphorylation activity and was able to phosphorylate MBP and His proteins
