* **Key message**  
    + The novel transcription factor OsERF106MZ negatively regulates shoot growth and salinity tolerance in rice through the disruption of ion homeostasis and modulation of stress-responsive gene expression
    + Overexpression of OsERF106MZ led to retardation of growth, relatively high levels of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced catalase (CAT) activity, and overaccumulation of both sodium (Na(+)) and potassium (K(+)) ions in transgenic rice shoots
    + OsERF106MZ is expressed in germinating seeds, primary roots, and developing flowers
