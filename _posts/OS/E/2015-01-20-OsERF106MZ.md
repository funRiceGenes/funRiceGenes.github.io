* **Key message**  
    + The novel transcription factor OsERF106MZ negatively regulates shoot growth and salinity tolerance in rice through the disruption of ion homeostasis and modulation of stress-responsive gene expression
    + Overexpression of OsERF106MZ led to retardation of growth, relatively high levels of both malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced catalase (CAT) activity, and overaccumulation of both sodium (Na(+)) and potassium (K(+)) ions in transgenic rice shoots
    + OsERF106MZ is expressed in germinating seeds, primary roots, and developing flowers
    + Overexpression of OsERF106MZ promotes parental root growth in rice seedlings by relieving the ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth under salinity stress conditions.
    + RESULTS: Histochemical staining to examine Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic rice seedlings harboring OsERF106MZp::GUS indicated that OsERF106MZ is mainly expressed in the root exodermis, sclerenchyma layer, and vascular system
    + OsERF106MZ overexpression in rice seedlings leads to an increase in primary root (PR) length
    + However, the roles of OsERF106MZ in root growth remain poorly understood
    + CONCLUSIONS: OsERF106MZ may play a role in maintaining root growth for resource uptake when rice seeds germinate under salinity stress by alleviating ABA-mediated root growth inhibition
    + OsERF106MZ is a salinity-induced gene that is expressed in germinating seeds and rice seedling roots
