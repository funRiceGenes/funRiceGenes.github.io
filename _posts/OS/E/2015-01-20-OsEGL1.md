* **Key message**  
    + Expression of an endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanase in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid and ethephon in rice seedlings
    + The matrix polysaccharide (1;3,1;4)-beat-D-glucan is involved in silicon-dependent strengthening of rice cell wall
    + The matrix polysaccharide (1;3,1;4)-beta-D-glucan is involved in silicon-dependent strengthening of rice cell wall
    + Here, we present an analysis of the correlative action of Si and MLG on the mechanical properties of leaf blades using a transgenic rice line in which the MLG level was reduced by overexpressing EGL1, which encodes (1;3,1;4)-beta-D-glucanase.
