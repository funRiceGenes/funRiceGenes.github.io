## Expression information
__Expression__:In rice seedling leaves, OsEGL1 gene expression significantly increased in response to methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, ethephon and mechanical wounding.  
__Expression__:RNA blot analysis revealed that the OsEGL1 gene is expressed constitutively not only in young roots of rice seedlings, but also in mature roots of adult rice plants.  
__OverExpression__:NA  
__OverExpression__:NA  
__RNAi__:NA
