## Key message
1. __ awn __, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath
2. __ awn __, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Genetic analyses and RNA-silencing experiments indicate that DL and OsETT2 act independently in awn formation, and that either gene alone is not sufficient for awn development
3. __ awn __, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsETT2 is expressed in the awn primordium in the awned indica floret, but not in the awnless japonica floret except in the provascular bundle
4. __ awn __, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We hypothesize that loss of expression of OsETT2 in the awn primordium is probably associated with the failure of awn formation in japonica strains
5. __leaf__, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath

7. __meristem__, [Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development
8. __transcription factor__, [Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways%5BTitle%5D),  Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development
9. __leaf__, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath
