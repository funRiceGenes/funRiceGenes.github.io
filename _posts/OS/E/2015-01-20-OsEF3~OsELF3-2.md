## Key message
1. __grain weight__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
2. __root__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
3. __heading date__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 regulates heading date by influencing the BVG stage and does not affect photoperiodic sensitivity, which suggests that the OsEF3 gene may be involved in an autonomous pathway in rice
4. __grain__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
5. __root development__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
6. __cell division__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
7. __cell elongation__, [OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsEF3, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis ELF3, has pleiotropic effects in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
8. __immunity__, [OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D), Functional analysis shows that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates immunity against M. oryzae in rice.
9. __blast resistance__, [OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D), All together, these results demonstrate that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates blast resistance in rice
10. __resistance__, [OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D), All together, these results demonstrate that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates blast resistance in rice

## Connection
1. __Hd17~Ef7~OsELF3-1__, __OsEF3~OsELF3-2__, [OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering%5BTitle%5D),  There are two orthologs OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 of ELF3 in rice Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified
2. __Hd17~Ef7~OsELF3-1__, __OsEF3~OsELF3-2__, [OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading
3. __APIP6__, __OsEF3~OsELF3-2__, [OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsELF3-2 interacts with APIP6 and negatively regulates basal resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.
