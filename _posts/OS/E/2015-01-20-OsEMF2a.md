* **Key message**  
    + The cell cycle was persistently activated in osemf2a caryopses, which was likely caused by cytokinin overproduction
    + The maternally expressed polycomb group gene OsEMF2a is essential for endosperm cellularization and imprinting in rice
    + Mutation of the imprinted gene OsEMF2a induces autonomous endosperm development and delayed cellularization in rice
