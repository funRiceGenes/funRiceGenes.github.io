* **Key message**  
    + Under paddy field conditions, OsECS-overexpression in transgenic rice plants increased rice grain yield (TGW) and improved biomass
    + Our findings suggest that increases in grain yield by OsECS overexpression could improve crop yields under natural environmental conditions
    + Overall, our results show that OsECS overexpression in transgenic rice increases tolerance and germination rate in the presence of abiotic stress by improving redox homeostasis via an enhanced GSH pool
