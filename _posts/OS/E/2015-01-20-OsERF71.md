    + Overexpression of the OsERF71 transcription factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.
    + OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma and high lignification levels
    + Overexpression of OsERF71 either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance
    + Furthermore, OsERF71 was found to directly bind to the promoter of OsCCR1, a key gene in lignin biosynthesis
    + Our latest study demonstrated that overexpression of the OsERF71 in rice roots under drought conditions modifies root structure including larger aerenchyma and radial root growth, and thereby, protects the rice plants from drought stresses
    + Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
    + Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues
