* **Key message**  
    + Osa-miR1320 targets the ERF transcription factor OsERF096 to regulate cold tolerance via JA-mediated signaling.
    + Furthermore, an AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor) transcription factor OsERF096 was identified as a target of miR1320 via 5&#x27;-RACE and dual luciferase assays
    + Consistently, OsERF096 negatively regulated cold stress tolerance
    + OsERF096 expression was altered by miR1320 overexpression and knockdown and exhibited an opposite pattern to that of miR1320 in different tissues and under cold stress
    + Furthermore, we suggested that OsERF096 could bind to the GCC and DRE cis-elements and act as a transcriptional activator in the nucleus
