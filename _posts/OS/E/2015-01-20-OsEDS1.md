* **Key message**  
    + In rice, PemG1 induced overexpressions of the SA signal-related genes (OsEDS1, OsPAL1, and OsNH1) but not the JA pathway-related genes (OsLOX2 and OsAOS2)
    + oryzicola (Xoc), suggesting the positive role of OsEDS1 in regulating rice disease resistance
    + Firstly, OsEDS1 modulates the rice-bacteria interactions involving in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway, while AtEDS1 regulates Arabidopsis disease resistance against biotrophic pathogens depending on salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway
    + Finally, OsEDS1 is not required for R gene mediated resistance, while AtEDS1 is required for disease resistance mediated by TIR-NB-LRR class of R proteins
    + Jasmonic Acid-Involved OsEDS1 Signaling in Rice-Bacteria Interactions.
    + Secondly, introducing AtEDS1 could reduce oseds1 mutant susceptibility to Xoo rather than to Xoc
    + Thirdly, exogenous application of JA and SA cannot complement the susceptible phenotype of the oseds1 mutant, while exogenous application of SA is capable of complementing the susceptible phenotype of the ateds1 mutant
