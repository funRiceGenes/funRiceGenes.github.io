* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase
    + This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 degrees C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold
    + ) phyAphyBphyC mutants lacking any phytochrome and containing the GCC box element, a binding site for rice ethylene-responsive element binding protein 1 (OsEREBP1), in its promoter region
    + Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
    + Comparative analysis of non-transgenic and OsEREBP1 overexpressing genotypes revealed that OsEREBP1 attenuates disease caused by Xoo and confers drought and submergence tolerance in transgenic rice
    + Constitutive expression of OsEREBP1 in rice driven by maize ubiquitin promoter did not affect normal plant growth
    + Overexpression of an AP2/ERF Type Transcription Factor OsEREBP1 Confers Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice.
    + A rice AP2/ERF transcription factor, OsEREBP1 is a downstream component of a signal transduction pathway in a specific interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and its bacterial pathogen, Xoo (Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Microarray analysis revealed that over expression of OsEREBP1 caused increased expression of lipid metabolism related genes such as lipase and chloroplastic lipoxygenase as well as several genes related to jasmonate and abscisic acid biosynthesis
    + Our results suggest that constitutive expression of OsEREBP1 activates the jasmonate and abscisic acid signalling pathways thereby priming the rice plants for enhanced survival under abiotic or biotic stress conditions
    + OsEREBP1 is thus, a good candidate gene for engineering plants for multiple stress tolerance
