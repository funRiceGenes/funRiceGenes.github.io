* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants
    + In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types
    + These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis
    + OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice

Seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ethylene-Induced Inhibition of Root Growth Requires Abscisic Acid Function in Rice Oryza sativa L. Seedlings%5BTitle%5D), In coleoptile, MHZ4-dependent ABA pathway acts at or upstream of OsEIN2 to negatively regulate coleoptile ethylene response, possibly by affecting OsEIN2 expression.
