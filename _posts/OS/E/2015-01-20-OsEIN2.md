* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants
    + In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types
    + These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis
    + OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice

Seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ethylene-Induced Inhibition of Root Growth Requires Abscisic Acid Function in Rice Oryza sativa L. Seedlings%5BTitle%5D), In coleoptile, MHZ4-dependent ABA pathway acts at or upstream of OsEIN2 to negatively regulate coleoptile ethylene response, possibly by affecting OsEIN2 expression.

    + __MHZ3__, __OsEIN2__, [Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.%5BTitle%5D),  Loss ofmhz3function reduces OsEIN2 abundance and attenuates ethylene-induced OsEIN2 accumulation, whereasMHZ3overexpression elevates the abundance of both wild-type and mutated OsEIN2 proteins, suggesting that MHZ3 is required for proper accumulation of OsEIN2 protein
    + __MHZ3__, __OsEIN2__, [Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.%5BTitle%5D),  The association of MHZ3 with the Nramp-like domain is crucial for OsEIN2 accumulation, demonstrating the significance of the OsEIN2 transmembrane domains in ethylene signaling
    + __MHZ3__, __OsEIN2__, [Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, MHZ3 negatively modulates OsEIN2 ubiquitination, protecting OsEIN2 from proteasome-mediated degradation

    + __OsACS1__, __OsEIN2__, [Priming effect of root-applied silicon on the enhancement of induced resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Priming effect of root-applied silicon on the enhancement of induced resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Increased resistance in rice was correlated with higher transcript levels of defense-related genes (OsERF1, OsEIN2 and OsACS1) in the ethylene (ET) pathway
