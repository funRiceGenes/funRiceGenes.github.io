* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants
    + In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types
    + These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis
    + OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice
    + Knock out of ethylene signaling genes OsEIL1 and OsEIN2 or exogenous application of 1-methylcyclopropene (ethylene inhibitor) and ethephon (ethylene analogues) eliminated the difference of blast resistance between the 70% and 90% relative humidity conditions, suggesting that the activation of ethylene signaling contributes to humidity-modulated basal resistance against M
