* **Key message**  
    + OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation
    + OsEF3 regulates heading date by influencing the BVG stage and does not affect photoperiodic sensitivity, which suggests that the OsEF3 gene may be involved in an autonomous pathway in rice
    + Functional analysis shows that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates immunity against M. oryzae in rice.
    + All together, these results demonstrate that OsELF3-2 negatively regulates blast resistance in rice
