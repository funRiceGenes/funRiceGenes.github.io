* **Key message**  
    + In Arabidopsis, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), which is an essential transcription factor for ethylene signaling, is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, while transcriptional regulation of EIN3 or EIN3-LIKE (EIL) genes has not been well documented
    + Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed
    + ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis
    + To gain a better understanding of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice, six EIN3-like genes (designated OsEIL1-6) were identified
    + OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component
    + The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene
    + OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants
    + These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice
    + Ethylene signaling components OsEIN2 and the downstream transcription factor OsEIL1 positively regulated disease resistance
    + The activation of OsEIL1 on YUC8M transcription and auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedling development.
    + Here, we report that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation
