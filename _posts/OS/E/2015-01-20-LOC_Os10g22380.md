* **Key message**  
    + Notably, the anther defects of osers1 are causally associated with the abnormal accumulation of H2O2, which can reconstitute the osers1 phenotype when applied to wild type
    + Further, metabolomics profiling reveals that OsERS1 is an important node for multiple metabolic pathways, indicated by the accumulation of amino acids and TCA components in osers1 anthers
