* **Key message**  
    + A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice
    + Two allelic mutants of OsETOL1 showed increased resistance to drought stress at the panicle development stage.
    + The OsETOL1 transcript was differentially responsive to abiotic stresses.

* **Connection**  
    + __OsACS2__, __OsETOL1__, [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsETOL1 was found to interact with OsACS2, a homolog of 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), which acts as a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis.
