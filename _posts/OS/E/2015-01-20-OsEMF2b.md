* **Key message**  
    + One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene
    + As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
    + The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice
    + Loss of EMF2B in rice results in complete sterility, and mutant flowers have severe floral organ defects and indeterminacy that resemble loss-of-function mutants in E-function floral organ specification genes.
    + Down-Regulation of OsEMF2b Caused Semi-sterility Due to Anther and Pollen Development Defects in Rice.
    + Overall, our work suggests that OsEMF2b plays an essential role during post-meiotic anther and pollen development
    + Its biological function in floral organ, flowering time and meristem determinacy have been well-studied, but its role, if only, on male reproduction is still unknown, because null mutants of OsEMF2b barely have anthers
    + OsEMF2b was highly expressed in tapetum and microspores, and the protein was localized in the nucleus
