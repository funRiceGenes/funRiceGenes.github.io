* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
    + This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria
    + In situ hybridization revealed that OsENOD93-1 is expressed in vascular bundles, as well as in epidermis and endodermis
