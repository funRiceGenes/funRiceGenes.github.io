* **Key message**  
    + An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.
    + Immunostaining showed that OsEXPA10 was localized at all cells of the root tips
    + In the presence of Al, knockout of OsEXPA10 did not alter the Al sensitivity evaluated by relative root elongation, but the root cell wall of knockout lines accumulated less Al compared to those of the wild-type rice
    + Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small
    + Knockout of OsEXPA10 resulted in a significant decrease in the cell elongation of the roots in the absence of Al
