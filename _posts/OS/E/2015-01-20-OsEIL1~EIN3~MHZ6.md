## Expression information
__Expression__: In rice, however, lack of MHZ6/OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 functions improves salt tolerance, whereas the overexpression lines exhibits salt hypersensitivity at seedling stage, indicating that MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 negatively regulate salt tolerance in rice |  Furthermore, this negative regulation by MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in salt tolerance is likely in part attributable to the direct regulation of OsHKT2;1 expression and Na+ uptake in roots |  Additionally, MHZ6/OsEIL1 overexpression promotes grain size and thousand-grain-weight  
__OverExpression__: In rice, however, lack of MHZ6/OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 functions improves salt tolerance, whereas the overexpression lines exhibits salt hypersensitivity at seedling stage, indicating that MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 negatively regulate salt tolerance in rice |  Additionally, MHZ6/OsEIL1 overexpression promotes grain size and thousand-grain-weight
