* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that rice osera1 mutant lines, harboring CRISPR/Cas9-induced frameshift mutations, exhibit similar leaf growth as control plants but increased primary root growth
    + CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of OsERA1 confers enhanced responses to abscisic acid and drought stress and increased primary root growth under nonstressed conditions in rice
    + These results illustrate that OsERA1 is a negative regulator of primary root growth under nonstressed conditions and also of responses to ABA and drought stress in rice
    + The osera1 mutant lines also display increased sensitivity to ABA and an enhanced response to drought stress through stomatal regulation
