* **Key message**  
    + We have successfully tested the efficiency of Cpf1 system in rice using OsEPFL9 which is a developmental gene known to regulate the stomatal density in leaf
    + Here, we report that the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF)/EPF-LIKE (EPFL) small secreted peptide family members OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 synergistically contribute to rice panicle morphogenesis by recognizing the OsER1 receptor and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade
    + Notably, OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 negatively regulate spikelet number per panicle, but OsEPFL8 also controls rice spikelet fertility
    + A osepfl6 osepfl7 osepfl9 triple mutant had significantly enhanced grain yield without affecting spikelet fertility, suggesting that specifically suppressing the OsEPFL6-OsER1, OsEPFL7-OsER1, and OsEPFL9-OsER1 ligand-receptor pairs can optimize rice panicle architecture
