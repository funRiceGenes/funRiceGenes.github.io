* **Key message**  
    + The results of northern blot hybridization experiments showed that the transcript of the OsEBP-89 gene accumulates primarily in immature seeds, roots, and leaves (low levels)
    + Expression of OsEBP-89 was induced in roots of rice seedlings by treatment with ACC, NaCl, or 2,4-D
    + Collectively, these results suggest that the OsEBP-89 gene is a new member of the EREBP subfamily and may be involved in ethylene-dependent seed maturation and shoot development of rice
    + In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a rice gene, OsEBP-89, encoding a protein 326 amino acids long with a typical EREBP domain; this is the first report of an EREBP transcription factor in a monocotyledonous plant
    + The OsEBP-89 gene of rice encodes a putative EREBP transcription factor and is temporally expressed in developing endosperm and intercalary meristem
    + OsEBP-89 gene encodes an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Expressional analysis of an EREBP transcription factor gene OsEBP-89 in rice
    + Northern blot analysis revealed that OsEBP-89 was expressed in root, stem, seeds, flowers and leaves of rice
    + Histochemical assay showed that GUS expressed mainly in phloem of vascular tissues of the root and stem transition region (RST), basal part of sheath roots, stem node and basal part of adventitious roots, also in endosperm of seeds in transgenic rice harboring OsEBP-89/GUS construct (pNSG)
    + Two cis-acting elements, an endosperm motif and a primary PERE, are present upstream of the OsEBP-89 coding region and may be involved in regulating its expression
    + In this study, we reported that OsEBP89 (Oryza sativa Ethylene-responsive element binding protein, clone 89), a member of the AP2/ERF subfamily, is involved in a novel signal transduction associated with the tolerance to drought and submergence stress
    + OsEBP89 was found to be strongly inhibited by drought stress and promoted by submergence
    + Loss of OsEBP89 was found to improve the seed germination under submerged conditions and also enhanced the tolerance to drought stress throughout growth stage
    + An APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor, OsEBP89 knockout enhances adaptation to direct-seeding on wet land and tolerance to drought stress in rice.
    + These findings provide insight into the mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance, and suggest OsEBP89 as a new genetic engineering resource to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice
    + The OsEBP89 protein was located at the nucleus in the rice protoplast
    + Further results indicate that OsEBP89 can interact with and be phosphorylated by SnRK1<a6><c1> (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 gene)
