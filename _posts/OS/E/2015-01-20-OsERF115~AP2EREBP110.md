* **Key message**  
    + OsERF115 acts as a transcriptional repressor to directly or indirectly modulate a set of grain-size genes during spikelet growth and endosperm development
    + Here, we report that the ethylene response factor OsERF115 functions as a key downstream regulator for ethylene-mediated grain development
    + In addition, the OsERF115 orthologues are identified only in grass species, implying a conserved and unique role in the grain development of cereal crops
    + Overexpression of OsERF115 significantly increases grain length, width, thickness and weight by promoting longitudinal elongation and transverse division of spikelet hull cells, as well as enhancing grain-filling activity, whereas its knockout mutations lead to the opposite effects, suggesting that OsERF115 positively regulates grain size and weight
    + Importantly, haplotype analysis reveals that the SNP variations in the EIN3-binding sites of OsERF115 promoter are significantly associated with the OsERF115 expression levels and grain weight, suggesting that natural variations in the OsERF115 promoter contribute to grain-size diversity

* **Connection**  
    + __OsEIL1~MHZ6__, __OsERF115~AP2EREBP110__, [The OsEIL1-OsERF115-target gene regulatory module controls grain size and weight in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsEIL1-OsERF115-target gene regulatory module controls grain size and weight in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsERF115 transcription is strongly induced by ethylene, and OsEIL1 directly binds to the promoter to activate its expression
