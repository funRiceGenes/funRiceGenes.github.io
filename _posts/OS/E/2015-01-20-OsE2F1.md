## Connection
1. __OsE2F1__, __OsE2F2__, [E2F sites that can interact with E2F proteins cloned from rice are required for meristematic tissue-specific expression of rice and tobacco proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(E2F sites that can interact with E2F proteins cloned from rice are required for meristematic tissue-specific expression of rice and tobacco proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoters%5BTitle%5D),  These E2F-like sites except for a rice site were indeed bound specifically by recombinant proteins of rice E2F, OsE2F1 and OsE2F2, and complexes of OsE2F1 with Arabidopsis DP proteins
