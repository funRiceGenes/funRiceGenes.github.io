## Key message
1. __drought__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D), " On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses"
2. __salt tolerance__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D),  Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice
3. __salinity__, ["OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors"%5BTitle%5D), " On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses"

## Connection
1. __OsEREBP1__, __OsEREBP2~ERF99__, [OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors%5BTitle%5D),  Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified
2. __OsEREBP2~ERF99__, __OsHOS1__, [The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D),  Using the yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ERF transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression
3. __OsEREBP2~ERF99__, __OsHOS1__, [The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, we showed that OsHOS1 affects the stability of both TFs in a proteasome dependent way, suggesting that this E3-ubiquitin ligase targets OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2 for degradation
