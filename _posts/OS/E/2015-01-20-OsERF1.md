* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report a novel member of ERF group in rice, OsERF1 (Ethylene Response Factor gene in Oryza sativa)
    + OsERF1 expressed consistently in different organs of rice and could be up-regulated by ethylene, a plant hormone associated with stress response
    + Overexpression of OsERF1 in Arabidopsis up-regulated the expression of two known ethylene-responsive genes, PDF1
    + These results suggest the involvement of OsERF1 in ethylene response
    + Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis
    + Expression of OsERF1, a transcription factor in the JA/ET pathway, was induced earlier than that of RSOsPR10 after salt, JA and ACC treatments
    + Simultaneous SA treatment strongly inhibited the induction of RSOsPR10 expression and, to a lesser extent, induction of OsERF1 expression
    + These results suggest that JA/ET and SA pathways function in the stress-responsive induction of RSOsPR10, and that OsERF1 may be one of the transcriptional factors in the JA/ET pathway
