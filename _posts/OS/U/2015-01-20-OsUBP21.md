* **Key message**  
    + Further, knocking the expression of OsUBP21 or AtUBP13 down or out increased the tolerance of rice and Arabidopsis plants to HS stress, suggesting that the function of these ubiquitin-specific proteases in regulating plant HS responses is conserved between monocots and dicots
