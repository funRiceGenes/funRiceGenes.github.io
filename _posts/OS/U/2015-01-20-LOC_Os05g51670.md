* **Key message**  
    + OsUGE1 is directly targeted by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair length in rice.
    + Here, we report a novel mechanism that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice
    + Knockout mutants of OsUGE1 using CRISPR-Cas9 technology showed longer root hairs than those of wild type
    + In contrast, overexpression lines of OsUGE1 displayed shorter root hair compared with those of wild type
    + Taken together, our study reveals a novel pathway that OsUGE1 is negatively controlled by OsGRF6 to regulate root hair elongation in rice
    + Subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsUGE1 is located in endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus and plasma membrane
    + Collectively, our results indicate that OsUGE1 not only functions as a UDP-glucose epimerase but also moonlights as a transcriptional activator to promote tapetum degradation, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism of rice reproductive development
    + Interestingly, we discovered that OsUGE1 participates in the TIP2/bHLH142-TDR-EAT1/DTD transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in tapetum degradation, in which TIP2 and TDR regulate the expression of OsUGE1 while OsUGE1 regulates the expression of EAT1
