* **Key message**  
    + The genetic divergence of OsUBR7 alleles among japonica and indica cultivars affects their transcriptional activity, and these alleles might have undergone selection during rice domestication
    + OsUBR7 mediates H2Bub1 at a number of chromatin loci for the normal expression of target genes, including cell cycle-related and pleiotropic genes, consistent with the observation that the osubr7 mutant had suppression of cell cycle progression due to reductions of H2Bub1 and expression levels at these loci
    + Rice OsUBR7 modulates plant height by regulating histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell proliferation.
    + Here we report a new plant height-related gene OsUBR7 in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + OsUBR7 encodes a putative E3 ligase containing a Plant Homeodomain-finger and an Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3 Component N-Recognin7 (UBR7) domain
