* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Both RNA interference lines and CRISPR/Cas9 null mutants of OsUBC26 reduced rice resistance to M
    + In summary, OsUBC26 plays important roles in rice disease resistance by regulating WRKY45 expression and working with E3 ligases such as APIP6 to counteract the effector protein AvrPiz-t from M
