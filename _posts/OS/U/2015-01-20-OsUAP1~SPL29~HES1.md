    + Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice
    + The SPL29 gene was identified by map-based cloning, and SPL29 was confirmed as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) by enzymatic analysis.
    + The plant hormones jasmonic acid and abscisic acid also accumulated in spl29 plants.
    + RNA sequencing analysis showed that photosystem-related genes were differentially expressed in the hes1 mutant under different temperatures, indicating that HES1 plays essential roles in maintaining chloroplast function
    + HES1 expression was induced under high temperature
    + ‚Äêı<U+3E32> Furthermore, loss of function of HES1 affected the HSFs expression and its mutation exhibited greater vulnerability to high temperature
    + Several experiments revealed that higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species occurred in the hes1 mutant under high temperature
    + TUNEL and comet experiments indicated that the hes1 undergo more severe DNA damage under high temperature
    + The determination of chlorophyll content and chloroplast¬†ultrastructure showed more severe photosystem-defects occurred in the hes1 mutant under high temperature
    + ‚Äêı<U+3E32> This study reveals that HES1 plays a key role in adaptation to high-temperature stress in rice
