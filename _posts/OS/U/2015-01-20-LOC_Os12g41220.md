* **Key message**  
    + Some Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes were upregulated in osuev1b mutant and OsUEV1B-RNAi plants in association with enhanced Pi acquisition, and representative Pi starvation responses, including stimulation of acid phosphatase activity and root hair growth, were also activated in the presence of sufficient Pi
    + In the present study, we found OsUEV1B was specifically inhibited by Pi deficiency, and was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + Our results indicate that OsUEV1B is required for rice phosphate homeostasis
    + Both osuev1b mutant and OsUEV1B-RNA interference (RNAi) lines displayed serious symptoms of toxicity due to Pi overaccumulation
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsVDAC1 in osuev1b partially restored its high Pi concentration to a level between those of osuev1b and DongJin
