* **Key message**  
    + We propose that OsUPS1 is responsible for allantoin partitioning in rice and its overexpression can support plant growth through accumulation of allantoin in sink tissues which can be utilized when N is limiting
    + Here, we show that OsUPS1 is localized in plasma membranes and are highly expressed in vascular tissues of rice
