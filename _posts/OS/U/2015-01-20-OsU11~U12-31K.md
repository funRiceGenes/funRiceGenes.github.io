## Key message
1. __meristem__, [The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants%5BTitle%5D),  The U11/U12-31K transcripts were abundantly expressed in the shoot apical meristems SAMs of Arabidopsis and rice
2. __growth__, [The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants%5BTitle%5D),  Among the several proteins unique to the U12-type spliceosomes, an Arabidopsis thaliana AtU11/U12-31K protein has been shown to be indispensible for proper U12 intron splicing and for normal growth and development of Arabidopsis plants
3. __cell division__, [The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants%5BTitle%5D),  Impaired cell division activity in the SAMs and inflorescence stems observed in the AtU11/U12-31K-deficient mutant was completely recovered to normal by the expression of OsU11/U12-31K
4. __inflorescence__, [The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Minor Spliceosomal Protein U11/U12-31K Is an RNA Chaperone Crucial for U12 Intron Splicing and the Development of Dicot and Monocot Plants%5BTitle%5D),  Impaired cell division activity in the SAMs and inflorescence stems observed in the AtU11/U12-31K-deficient mutant was completely recovered to normal by the expression of OsU11/U12-31K
