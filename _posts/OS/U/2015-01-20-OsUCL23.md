* **Key message**  
    + We further demonstrated that OsmiR528 affects pollen development by directly targeting the uclacyanin gene OsUCL23 (encoding a member of the plant-specific blue copper protein family of phytocyanins) and regulating intine deposition
    + We propose a model in which OsmiR528 regulates pollen intine formation by directly targeting OsUCL23 and in which OsUCL23 interacts with the POT protein on the PVCs and MVBs to regulate the production of metabolites during pollen development
