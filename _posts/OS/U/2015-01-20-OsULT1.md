* **Key message**  
    + Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure
    + Moreover, OsULT1 interacts with rice SET domain-containing methyltransferase TRX1, suggesting OsULT1 is an integral part of plant Trithorax group complex

    + __OsTCP19__, __OsULT1__, [OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways%5BTitle%5D), Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure

    + __OsDREB1B__, __OsULT1__, [Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 OsULT1 specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 OsULT1 specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, binding of OsULT1 to GAGAG motif, along with a decrease in H3K27me3 suggests that OsULT1 antagonises the repressive effect of PcG complex for transcriptional activation of OsDREB1b
