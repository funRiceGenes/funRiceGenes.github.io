* **Key message**  
    + The suppression of UGPase by the introduction of a UGPase1-RNAi construct in wild-type plants nearly eliminated seed set because of the male defect, with developmental retardation similar to the ms-h mutant phenotype, whereas overexpression of UGPase1 in ms-h mutant plants restored male fertility and the transformants produced T(1) seeds that segregated into normal and chalky endosperms
    + Our results suggest that UGPase1 plays a key role in pollen development as well as seed carbohydrate metabolism
    + OsUgp1 has recently been reported to be essential for callose deposition during pollen mother cell and meiosis stages as well as for seed carbohydrate metabolism
    + OsUgp2 complements OsUgp1 to fulfill the UGPase’s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development
    + Pollen mother cells (PMCs) of Ugp1-silenced plants appeared normal before meiosis, but during meiosis, normal callose deposition was disrupted
    + These results demonstrate that rice Ugp1 is required for callose deposition during PMC meiosis and bridges the apoplastic unloading pathway and pollen development
    + We report a functional characterization of rice Ugp1, which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in florets, especially in pollen during anther development
    + Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development
    + In addition, both phenotypes were co-segregated with the UGPase1 transgene in segregating T(1) plants, which demonstrates that UGPase1 has functional roles in both male sterility and the development of a chalky endosperm
    + Inactivation of the UGPase1 gene causes genic male sterility and endosperm chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Ugp1 silencing by RNA interference or cosuppression results in male sterility
