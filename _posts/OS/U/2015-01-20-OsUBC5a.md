* **Key message**  
    + SPL35 directly interacts with the E2 protein OsUBC5a and the coatomer subunit delta proteins Delta-COP1 and Delta-COP2 through the CUE domain, and down-regulation of these interacting proteins also cause development of HR-like lesions resembling those in spl35 and activation of defence responses, indicating that SPL35 may be involved in the ubiquitination and vesicular trafficking pathways
