* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsUBP15,LG1  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os02g14730](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g14730)

    + [Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice%5BTitle%5D), 2019, Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Genetic data indicated that OsUBP15 and GW2 were not independent in regulating grain width and size
    + In summary, we identified OsUBP15 as a positive regulator of grain width and size in rice and provide a promising strategy for improvement of grain yield by pyramiding OsUBP15 and gw2
