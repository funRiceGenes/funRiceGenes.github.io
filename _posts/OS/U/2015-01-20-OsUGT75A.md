* **Key message**  
    + UDP-glucosyltransferase OsUGT75A promotes submergence tolerance during rice seed germination.
    + Herein, we report that natural variation of rice coleoptile length subjected to submergence is determined by the glucosyltransferase encoding gene OsUGT75A
    + OsUGT75A regulates coleoptile length via decreasing free abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) levels by promoting glycosylation of these two phytohormones under submergence
    + Moreover, we find that OsUGT75A accelerates coleoptile length through mediating the interactions between JASMONATE ZIMDOMAIN (OsJAZ) and ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE (OsABI) proteins
    + Thus, we propose that OsUGT75A is a useful target in breeding of rice varieties suitable for direct seeding cultivation
