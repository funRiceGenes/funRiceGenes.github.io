* **Key message**  
    + No transcripts were found in leaf, stem, lemma/palea, ripening grain and florets before the uninucleate microspore developmental stage, but a large quantity of OsUgp2 mRNA was found in pollen at the binucleate and mature stages
    + OsUgp2, a rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene, has previously been shown to preferentially express in maturing pollens and plays an important role in pollen starch accumulation
    + Northern blot and RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of OsUgp2 was preferentially in pollen and developmentally regulated
    + The pollen fertility of 16 independent transgenic rice plants was found between 25% and 90%, which was correlated with the amount of OsUgp2 mRNA
    + These results demonstrated that OsUgp2 is a pollen-preferential “late gene and plays a key role during pollen maturation, especially for starch accumulation
    + OsUgp2 complements OsUgp1 to fulfill the UGPase’s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development
    + UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase2 (OsUgp2), a pollen-preferential gene in rice, plays a critical role in starch accumulation during pollen maturation
    + In this study, a full-length cDNA of OsUgp2 was isolated from rice anther
    + Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development
    + Functional analysis of a rice late pollen-abundant UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (OsUgp2) promoter
