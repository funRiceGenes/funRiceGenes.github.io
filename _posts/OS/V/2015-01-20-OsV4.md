* **Key message**  
    + In this paper, we isolated and characterized a temperature-conditional virescent mutant, OsV4, in rice (Oryza sativa cultivar Jiahua1 (WT, japonica rice variety))
    + These findings suggest that OsV4 plays an important role during early chloroplast development under cold stress in rice
    + The rice OsV4 encoding a novel pentatricopeptide repeat protein is required for chloroplast development during the early leaf stage under cold stress
    + Genetic and molecular analyses uncovered that OsV4 encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein including four PPR motifs
