* **Key message**  
    + Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering
    + LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF
    + Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a
    + Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused late flowering under both long and short days
    + As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
    + Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1
    + OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice
    + Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.
    + Mutations in OsVIL2 led to shorter plants and fewer grains whereas its overexpression (OX) enhanced biomass production and grain numbers when compared with the wild type
    + We conclude that OsVIL2 improves the production of biomass and grain by suppressing OsCKX2 chromatin
    + Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that, among the downregulated genes, OsVIL2 was directly associated with chromatins in the promoter region of CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE2 (OsCKX2), a gene responsible for cytokinin degradation
    + In this study, we report that loss-of-function mutants in OsVIL2 showed a phenotype of reduced tiller number in rice
    + Tiller number of double mutant osvil2 ostb1 was similar to that of ostb1 , suggesting that osvil2 is epistatic to ostb1
