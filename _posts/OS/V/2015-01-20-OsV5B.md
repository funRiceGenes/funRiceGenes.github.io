* **Key message**  
    + Differential protein abundances of OsV5A and OsV5B in rice seedlings at different leaf developmental stages were also revealed
    + Deficiency of OsV5A and OsV5B occurred in pre-emerged and emerging leaves in osv5a seedlings at 22 Â°C, leading to reduced POR accumulation and chlorophyll content
    + OsV5A apparently developed a specialized role for regulating POR abundances at the leaf pre-emergence stage while the same function is performed by OsV5B during leaf emergence and expansion
    + Both OsV5A and OsV5B are localized in the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes
    + OsV5A and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress
