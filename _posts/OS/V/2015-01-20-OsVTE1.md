2. __stem__, [The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The tissue-specific expression pattern and OsVTE1-promoter GUS activity assay showed that OsVTE1 was mainly expressed in the leaf, and also could be detected in the root, stem and panicle
3. __panicle__, [The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The tissue-specific expression pattern and OsVTE1-promoter GUS activity assay showed that OsVTE1 was mainly expressed in the leaf, and also could be detected in the root, stem and panicle
