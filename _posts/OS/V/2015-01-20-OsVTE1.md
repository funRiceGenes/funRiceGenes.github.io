* **Key message**  
    + OsVTE1 was induced significantly by abiotic stresses such as high salt, H(2)O(2), drought, cold and by the plant hormones ABA and salicylic acid
    + The tissue-specific expression pattern and OsVTE1-promoter GUS activity assay showed that OsVTE1 was mainly expressed in the leaf, and also could be detected in the root, stem and panicle
    + Compared with control plants, transgenic plants with Os-VTE1 RNA interference (OsVTE1-RNAi) were more sensitive to salt stress whereas, in contrast, transgenic plants overexpressing OsVTE1 (OsVTE1-OX) showed higher tolerance to salt stress
