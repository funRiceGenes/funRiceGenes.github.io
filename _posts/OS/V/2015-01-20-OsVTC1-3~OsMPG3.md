* **Key message**  
    + Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.
    + Our work demonstrates an important link between excessive root NH(4) (+) efflux and OsVTC1-3-mediated protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH(4) (+) nutrition and identifies OsEIL1 as a direct genetic regulator of OsVTC1-3 expression
