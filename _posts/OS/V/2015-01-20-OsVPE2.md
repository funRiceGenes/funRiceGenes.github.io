* **Key message**  
    + Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice
    + Vacuolar Pi content was higher in the loss-of-function Osvpe1<U+2009>Osvpe2 double mutant than in wild type, particularly under low-Pi stress
    + Overexpression of either OsVPE1 or OsVPE2 in transgenic plants reduced vacuolar Pi content, consistent with a role in vacuolar Pi efflux
