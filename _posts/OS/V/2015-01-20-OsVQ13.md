* **Key message**  
    + The transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsVQ13 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased JA-induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Jasmonic Acid-Induced VQ-Motif-Containing Protein OsVQ13 Influences the OsWRKY45 Signaling Pathway and Grain Size by Associating with OsMPK6 in Rice.
    + OsVQ13 was primarily located in the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + In this study, we investigated the role of the JA-responsive valine-glutamine (VQ)-motif-containing protein OsVQ13 in JA signaling in rice
    + These results indicated that OsVQ13 positively regulated JA signaling by activating the OsMPK6-OsWRKY45 signaling pathway in rice
