    + Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice
    + The accumulation of zinc, copper, and manganese also changed significantly in the shoots of osvit2 plants
    + Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (OsVIT2) T-DNA insertion line (osvit2) and report that the knockdown of OsVIT2 and mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) expression affects seed Fe localization
    + The concentration of Fe increased in osvit2 polished seeds
    + Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT2 was higher in MIT knockdown (mit-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit-2 seeds decreased significantly
    + Moreover, changes in the expression of OsVIT2 and MIT affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds
    + The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed
    + Interestingly, functional disruption of OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 leads to increased Fe/Zn accumulation in rice seeds and a corresponding decrease in the source organ flag leaves, indicating an enhanced Fe/Zn translocation between source and sink organs, which might represent a novel strategy to biofortify Fe/Zn in staple foods
    + FINDINGS: osvit2 plants accumulated less Fe in their shoots when grown under normal or excess Fe conditions, while the accumulation of Fe was comparable to that in wild-type (WT) plants under Fe-deficient conditions
    + In rice, OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are highly expressed in flag leaf blade and sheath, respectively, and in contrast to OsVIT1, OsVIT2 is highly responsive to Fe treatments
    + The growth of osvit2 plants was also slow compared to that of WT plants
    + OsVIT2 was expressed in the parenchyma cell bridges of nodes, in the mestome sheath of leaf sheath and aleurone of the caryopsis
    + Mutation of OsVIT2 resulted in decreased Fe distribution to the leaf sheath, nodes, and aleurone, but increased Fe to the leaf blade and grains
    + These results indicate that OsVIT2 is involved in the distribution of Fe to the grains through sequestering Fe into vacuoles in mestome sheath, nodes, and aleurone layer and that knockout of this gene provides a potential way for Fe biofortification without yield penalty
    + Role of a vacuolar iron transporter OsVIT2 in the distribution of iron to rice grains
    + We functionally characterized a vacuolar iron transporter gene, OsVIT2 in terms of expression pattern, cellular localization, and mutant phenotypes
    + OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter OsVIT2 expression
