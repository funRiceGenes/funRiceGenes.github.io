* **Key message**  
    + Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program
    + The transcription factor VP1 regulates maturation and dormancy in plant seeds by activating genes responsive to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA)
    + VP1 has been shown to be a transcription factor essential for seed maturation and dormancy induction
    + The Seed-Specific Transcription Factor VP1 (OSVP1) Is Expressed in Rice Suspension-Cultured Cells
    + Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos
    + A seed-specific transcriptional regulator, VP1, is required for the induction of ABA-regulated genes that include Lea (late embryogenesis abundant protein) genes
    + Osvp1 transcript was detected in developing embryo as early as 10 days after flowering and decreased toward maturity
    + A fusion gene (Osem-GUS) consisting of the Osem promoter and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was constructed and tested in a transient expression system, using protoplasts derived from a suspension-cultured line of rice cells, for activation by ABA and by co-transfection with an expression vector (35S-Osvp1) for the rice VP1 (OSVP1) cDNA
    + The expression of Osem-GUS was strongly (40- to 150-fold) activated by externally applied ABA and by over-expression of (OS)VP1
    + Short, direct repeats (SDRs)-mediated post-transcriptional processing of a transcription factor gene OsVP1 in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + While, the seedlings with downregulation of OsEMF2b exhibited hyper-sensitive response to ABA and the expression of OsVP1 is upregulated
    + We proposed that OsEMF2b may play a pivotal role in seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1 indirectly or directly
    + Yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP analyses proved that OsEMF2b could bind to the promoter of OsVP1 directly and affected H3K27me3 enrichments of OsVP1 in seedling
    + Interestingly, both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichments of OsVP1 were changed with OsEMF2b mis-expression in seed and seedling
    + These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance
    + Kasalath and SL9 (an RcRcVP1VP1 substitution line with Nipponbare background) showed more ABA sensitivity than the Nipponbare (rcrcVP1VP1) by the germination assay, and the transcriptional abundance of ABA signal genes OsABI2, OsSnRK2, OsVP1, ABI5, and especially OsVP1 increased in the red pericarp line SL9
    + Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind Rc (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates Rc and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice
    + Transcriptome analysis of knockout mutants of rice seed dormancy gene OsVP1 and Sdr4.
    + OsVP1 and Sdr4 play an important role in regulating seed dormancy that involved in multiple metabolism and regulatory pathways
    + The weakened dormancy of mutants indicated that the functions of OsVP1 and Sdr4 are required for normal early seed dormancy
    + These results suggest that OsVP1 and Sdr4 play an important role in regulating seed dormancy by multiple metabolism and regulatory pathways
