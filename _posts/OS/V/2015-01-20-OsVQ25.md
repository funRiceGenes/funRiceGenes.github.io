* **Key message**  
    + Knockout mutants of OsVQ25 exhibit enhanced resistance to both pathogens without a growth penalty
    + OsWRKY53 downstream defense-related genes and brassinosteroid signaling genes are upregulated in osvq25 mutants
    + Furthermore, OsVQ25 interacts with and suppresses the transcriptional activity of OsWRKY53, a positive regulator of plant immunity
    + Â oryzae and Xoo by interacting with and promoting OsVQ25 degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway
