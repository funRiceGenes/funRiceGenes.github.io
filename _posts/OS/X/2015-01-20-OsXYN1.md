* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The findings that OsXyn1 is involved in plant cell wall deposition and regulates plant growth and development help shed light on the functions of the rice GH10 family
    + Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein OsXYN1 is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.
    + Map-based cloning of the ss1 mutant identified the candidate gene as OsXyn1 (LOC_03g47010), which encodes a xylanase-like protein belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 10 (GH10) family
