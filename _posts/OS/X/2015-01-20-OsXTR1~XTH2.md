## Key message
1. __gibberellin__, [Characterization of XET-related genes of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of XET-related genes of rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 were up-regulated by gibberellin and brassinosteroids, whereas OsXTR2 and OsXTR4 showed no clear response to these hormones
2. __ BR __, [A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling%5BTitle%5D),  OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of OsXTR1, which encodes xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, the cell-wall loosening enzyme necessary for cell elongation, and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell signalling and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of OsMDP1 in BR signalling
3. __cell elongation__, [A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling%5BTitle%5D),  OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of OsXTR1, which encodes xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, the cell-wall loosening enzyme necessary for cell elongation, and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell signalling and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of OsMDP1 in BR signalling
4. __height__, [Characterization of XET-related genes of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of XET-related genes of rice%5BTitle%5D),  In three genetic mutants with abnormal heights, the expression of OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 correlated with the height of the mutants, whereas no such correlation was observed for OsXTR2 and OsXTR4
5. __brassinosteroid__, [Characterization of XET-related genes of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of XET-related genes of rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 were up-regulated by gibberellin and brassinosteroids, whereas OsXTR2 and OsXTR4 showed no clear response to these hormones
