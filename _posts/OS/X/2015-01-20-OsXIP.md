* **Key message**  
    + Analysis using an OsXIP-specific antibody revealed that OsXIP is markedly accumulated in apoplast in rice root cells by wounding
    + The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root
    + These results reinforced the possibility that OsXIP is involved in plant defense mechanisms against phytopathogens
    + Although the OsXIP gene was specifically expressed in mature grains under basal conditions, recombinant OsXIP had no effect on rice endogenous xylanases, and OsXIP-suppressed transgenic rice plants did not exhibit any change in grain development and germination, suggesting that rice development may be independent of OsXIP
    + RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice
