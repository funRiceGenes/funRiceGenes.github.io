## Information
__Symbol__: OsXXT1  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os03g18820](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g18820)  
__RAPdb__: [Os03g0300000](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os03g0300000)  

## Publication
1. [Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, J Exp Bot.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Furthermore, expression of the full-length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant |  Transgenic plants expressing the β-glucuronidase GUS reporter under the control of the OsXXT1 promoter displayed GUS expression in multiple tissues, most prominently in root epidermal cells  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
