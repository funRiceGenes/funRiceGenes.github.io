* **Key message**  
    + Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting
    + In OsiICK6-over-expressing plants, leaves rolled toward the abaxial side, suggesting that cell proliferation is critical in maintaining an even growth along the dorsal-ventral plane of leaf blades
    + Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development

* **Connection**  
    + __OsiICK1__, __OsiICK6__, [Analyses of two rice Oryza sativa cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Analyses of two rice Oryza sativa cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D), KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively
    + __OsiICK1__, __OsiICK6__, [Analyses of two rice Oryza sativa cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Analyses of two rice Oryza sativa cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D), Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA
