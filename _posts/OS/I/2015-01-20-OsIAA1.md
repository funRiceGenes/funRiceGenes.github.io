    + Indica) OsIAA1 cDNA as a monocot member of the Aux/IAA gene family
    + The predicted amino acid sequence of OsIAA1 corresponds to a protein of ca
    + Northern blot analysis revealed that the OsIAA1 transcript levels decrease in the excised coleoptile segments on auxin starvation, and the level is restored when auxin is supplemented; the increase in OsIAA1 transcript level was apparent within 15 to 30 min of auxin application
    + Auxin-induced OsIAA1 expression appears to be correlated with the elongation of excised coleoptile segments
    + In light-grown rice seedlings, OsIAA1 is preferentially expressed in roots and basal segment of the seedling, whereas in the etiolated rice seedlings, the OsIAA1 transcripts are most abundant in the coleoptile
    + A comparative analysis in light- and dark-grown seedling tissues indicates that the OsIAA1 transcript levels decrease on illumination
    + OsIAA1, an Aux/IAA cDNA from Rice, and Changes in Its Expression as Influenced by Auxin and Light
    + In addition, the OsIAA1-overexpression transgenic plants showed distinctive morphological changes such as decreased plant height and loose plant architecture
    + T-DNA insertion mutant of OsARF1 showed reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, resembling the phenotype of OsIAA1-overexpression plants
    + Over-expression of OsIAA1 in rice resulted in reduced inhibition of root elongation to auxin treatment, but increased sensitivity to 24-epiBL treatment
    + In addition, expression patterns of some genes responsive to brassinosteroid and auxin were changed in the OsIAA1-overexpression plants
    + These data suggested that OsIAA1 may play important roles in the cross-talk of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways and plant morphogenesis
    + Characterization of OsIAA1 gene, a member of rice Aux/IAA family involved in auxin and brassinosteroid hormone responses and plant morphogenesis
    + Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1
    + This work focused on isolation and characterization of a member of Aux/IAA family in rice named OsIAA1
    + The results indicated that OsIAA1 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated
    + Protein interaction analysis suggested that OsIAA1 may act through interaction with OsARF1
