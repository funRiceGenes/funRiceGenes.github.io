* **Key message**  
    + RNAi mediated silencing of a wall associated kinase, OsiWAK1 in Oryza sativa results in impaired root development and sterility due to anther indehiscence: Wall Associated Kinases from Oryza sativa
    + Examination of the transgenic plants reveals that OsiWAK1 transcript silencing in rice results in dwarf plants because of the reduction in the size of leaves, flag-leaves, internodes and panicle
    + These data suggest that OsiWAK1 may play an important role in rice plant growth and development
