* **Key message**  
    + OsIAA4-overexpressing rice plants show dwarfism, increased tiller angles, reduced gravity response, and are less sensitive to synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)
    + Ectopic Overexpression of an AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) Gene OsIAA4 in Rice Induces Morphological Changes and Reduces Responsiveness to Auxin
    + The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes
    + In this study, we isolated and identified an Aux/IAA protein gene from rice, OsIAA4, whose protein contains a dominant mutation-type domain II
    + OsIAA4 has very low expression in the entire life cycle of rice
