* **Key message**  
    + Chromatin-remodeling factor OsINO80 is involved in regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis and is crucial for rice plant growth and development.
    + Thus, our study identified a rice chromatin-remodeling factor, OsINO80, and demonstrated that OsINO80 is involved in regulation of the GA biosynthesis pathway and plays critical functions for many aspects of rice plant growth and development
    + Consistently, transcriptome analyses reveal that OsINO80 knockdown results in downregulation by more than two-fold of over 1,000 genes, including the GA biosynthesis genes CPS1 and GA3ox2, and the dwarf phenotype of OsINO80-knockdown mutants can be rescued by the application of exogenous GA3
