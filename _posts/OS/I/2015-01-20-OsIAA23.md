* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsIAA23 is specific to the QC of the root tip during the development of primary, lateral and crown roots
    + Consistent with OsIAA23 expression in the QC, the auxin signaling marked by DR5p::GUS (ss-glucuronidase) was absent in the QC region of Osiaa23
    + These results indicate that the maintenance of the QC is dependent on OsIAA23-mediated auxin signaling in the QC
    + OsIAA23-mediated auxin signaling defines postembryonic maintenance of QC in rice
    + The mutant is characterized by a loss of QC identity during postembryonic development, and the displayed defects result from a stabilizing mutation in domain II of OsIAA23 (Os06g39590)
    + Transgenic rice plants harboring Osiaa23 under the control of the QHB promoter mimic partially the defects of Osiaa23
