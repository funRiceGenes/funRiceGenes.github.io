* **Key message**  
    + CONCLUSIONS: The analysis we conducted in plant mitochondria provided the negative, though we argue relevant, result that IP6K does not actually occur in vegetable mtDNA
    + On the other hand, the up-regulation of a MIPS, an IMP, an IPK2, and an ITP5/6K in anthers suggested that a PLC-mediated pathway was active in addition to a lipid-independent pathway in the anthers
    + Furthermore, expressing additional OsIPK2 or its N-terminal amino acid sequence enhanced the accumulation of OsIAA11 protein in transgenic plants, which in turn caused defects in lateral root formation and auxin response
