* **Key message**  
    + In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2
    + Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice
    + Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes
