* **Key message**  
    + These results indicated that OsIBR5 is a MKP which was induced by abiotic stresses and decreased tolerance to drought stress in transgenic tobacco plants
    + Drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure was significantly reduced in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants compared with controls
    + Overexpression of OsIBR5 in tobacco plants resulted in hypersensitivity to drought and H(2)O(2) treatments
    + Moreover, OsIBR5 was found to interact with tobacco MAPKs SIPK and WIPK, and drought-induced WIPK activity was impaired in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants
