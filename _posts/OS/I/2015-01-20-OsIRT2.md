## Key message
1. __growth__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D),  When expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, OsIRT2 cDNA reversed the growth defects of a yeast Fe-uptake mutant
2. __cadmium__, [Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
3. __transporter__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D),  Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions
4. __root__, [Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+%5BTitle%5D),  Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions
5. __iron__, [Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
6. __transporter__, [Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast mutants expressing OsIRT1 and OsIRT2, which encode the rice Fe2+ transporter, became more sensitive to Cd, suggesting that Cd was absorbed by OsIRT1 and OsIRT2
