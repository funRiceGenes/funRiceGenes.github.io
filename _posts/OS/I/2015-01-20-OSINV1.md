## Key message
1. __cell wall__, [Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility%5BTitle%5D),  Expression analysis of two cell wall OSINV1, 4 and one vacuolar OSINV2 acid invertase genes showed that OSINV4 is anther-specific and downregulated by cold treatment
