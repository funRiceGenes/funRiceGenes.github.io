* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that the expressions of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, are strongly induced under Fe-deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases
    + Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe-deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds
    + Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice
    + Knockdown of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 caused minor effects, including repression of some Fe uptake- and translocation-related genes in OsIMA1 knockdown roots
