* **Publication**  
    + [Molecular characterization of a light-responsive gene, breast basic conserved protein 1 OsiBBC1, encoding nuclear-localized protein homologous to ribosomal protein L13 from Oryza sativa indica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular characterization of a light-responsive gene, breast basic conserved protein 1 OsiBBC1, encoding nuclear-localized protein homologous to ribosomal protein L13 from Oryza sativa indica%5BTitle%5D), 2004, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Northern analysis showed that OsiBBC1 is expressed more in the young root, post-fertilized influorescence, leaf base and callus tissue, which are comprised of actively dividing cells, indicating its role in cell division
    + The OsiBBC1 transcript accumulated more in the root of light-grown seedlings as compared to the shoot while its levels were higher in the shoot as compared to root of the etiolated seedlings, indicating its down-regulation by light
