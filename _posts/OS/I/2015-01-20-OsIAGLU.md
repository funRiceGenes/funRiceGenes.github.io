## Key message
1. __flower__, [Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA%5BTitle%5D),  The OsIAGLU gene driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter was transformed into a rice cultivar to generate transgenic rice plants constitutively over-expressing this gene
2. __iaa__, [Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA%5BTitle%5D),  To decrease IAA levels, we selected the rice IAA-glucose synthase gene OsIAGLU from the rice genome database based on high sequence homology with IAA-glucose synthase from maize ZmIAGLU), which is known to generate IAAglucose conjugate from free IAA

4. __tiller__, [Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA%5BTitle%5D), Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA
