* **Key message**  
    + Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively
    + Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
    + Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
