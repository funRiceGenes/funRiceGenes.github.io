* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsIMA1 or OsIMA2 in rice conferred tolerance to Fe deficiency and accumulation of Fe in leaves and seeds
    + Here, we report that the expression of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, is strongly induced under Fe deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, and OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases
    + Iron deficiency-inducible peptide-coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice.
    + These results indicate that OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 play key roles in enhancing the major pathway of the Fe deficiency response in rice
