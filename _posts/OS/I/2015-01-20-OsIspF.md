* **Key message**  
    + OsIspF was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast
    + OsIspF gene was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast
    + By map-based cloning of this mutant, we identified OsIspF gene (LOC_Os02g45660) showing significant similarity to IspF gene of Arabidopsis, in which a missense mutation occurred in the mutant, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein
