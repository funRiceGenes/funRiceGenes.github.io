* **Key message**  
    + Expression studies revealed that the OsiEZ1 transcript level was highest in rice flowers, almost undetectable in developing seeds of 1-2 days post-fertilization but increased significantly in young seeds of 3-5 days post-fertilization
    + The OsiEZ1 transcript was barely detectable in mature zygotic embryos, but its levels were significantly higher in callus derived from rice scutellum, somatic embryos and young seedlings
    + A POLYCOMB group gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica), OsiEZ1, codes for a nuclear-localized protein expressed preferentially in young seedlings and during reproductive development
    + Over-expression of the SET domain of OsSET1 in Arabidopsis resulted in altered shoot development at seedling stages
    + The expression of SDG711 and SDG718 is induced by LD and SD, respectively.
