## Key message
1. __starch__, [Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility%5BTitle%5D)),  The down-regulation of OSINV4 expression in the tapetum at YM may cause a disruption in hexose production and starch formation in the pollen grains
2. __starch__, [Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cold-induced repression of the rice anther-specific cell wall invertase gene OSINV4 is correlated with sucrose accumulation and pollen sterility%5BTitle%5D)),  In a cold-tolerant cultivar, OSINV4 expression was not reduced by cold; sucrose did not accumulate in the anthers and starch formation in the pollen grains was not affected
3. __chilling__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation"
