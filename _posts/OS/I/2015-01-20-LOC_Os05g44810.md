* **Key message**  
    + In this study, the OsIAA18 gene was introduced into the rice cultivar, Zhonghua 11 and the OsIAA18 overexpression in rice plants exhibited significantly enhanced salt and drought tolerance compared to the wild type (WT)
    + Overexpression of OsIAA18 upregulated the genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and signaling pathways, proline biosynthesis pathway, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging system in the overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice plants under salt and drought stresses
    + Taken together, we suggest that OsIAA18 plays a positive role in drought and salt tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA signaling
    + However, little work is known about the regulatory functions of the OsIAA18 gene in regulating the abiotic stress tolerance of rice
    + The OsIAA18 gene has a potential application in genetically modified crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice increased endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and the overexpression of OsIAA18 in rice plants showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA treatment at both the germination and postgermination stages compared to WT
