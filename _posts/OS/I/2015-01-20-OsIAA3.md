## Key message
1. __auxin__, [Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein%5BTitle%5D)),  OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin
