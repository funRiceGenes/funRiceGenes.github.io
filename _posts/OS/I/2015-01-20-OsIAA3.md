* **Key message**  
    + OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin
    + We produced transgenic rice harboring mOsIAA3-GR, which can overproduce mutant OsIAA3 protein containing an amino acid change in domain II to cause a gain-of-function phenotype, by treatment with dexamethasone
    + Ethylene produced in response to exogenous KT inhibited rice seminal root growth by reducing meristem size via upregulation of OsIAA3 transcription and reduced cell length by downregulating transcription of cell elongation-related genes
    + Moreover, the effects of KT treatment on rice seminal root growth, root meristem size and cell length were rescued by treatment with aminoethoxyvinylglycine (an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis), which restored ethylene level and transcription levels of OsIAA3 and cell elongation-related genes
