## Expression information

## Key message
1. __sterile__, [Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D),  As such, the OSIPA promoter seems promising for generation of stable male-sterile lines required for the production of hybrids in rice and other crop plants
2. __pollen__, [Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D), Earlier, a pollen-specific Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA), coding for expansins/pollen allergens, was isolated from rice, and its promoter--upon expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis--was found active during the late stages of pollen development
3. __pollen__, [Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D), Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene OSIPA promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems
4. __panicle__, [Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D), Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases CDPK), respectively
5. __pollen__, [Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D), Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases CDPK), respectively
6. __pollen__, [Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D),  Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
7. __pollen__, [Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D),  Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
8. __anther__, [Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D),  Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
9. __anther__, [Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems%5BTitle%5D),  Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
