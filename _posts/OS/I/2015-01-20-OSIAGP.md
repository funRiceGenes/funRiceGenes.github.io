* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OSIAGP  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os06g21410](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g21410)  
    + RAPdb: [Os06g0319133](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os06g0319133)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Characterization of a pollen-preferential gene OSIAGP from rice Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica coding for an arabinogalactan protein homologue, and analysis of its promoter activity during pollen development and pollen tube growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a pollen-preferential gene OSIAGP from rice Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica coding for an arabinogalactan protein homologue, and analysis of its promoter activity during pollen development and pollen tube growth%5BTitle%5D), 2010, Transgenic Res.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The homology of OSIAGP with AGP23 and the fact that seedling growth in the dark and pollen tube growth are events based on cell elongation strengthen the possibility of OSIAGP performing a similar function
    + Characterization of a pollen-preferential gene OSIAGP from rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica) coding for an arabinogalactan protein homologue, and analysis of its promoter activity during pollen development and pollen tube growth
    + OSIAGP transcripts also accumulate in shoots and roots of rice seedling grown in the dark, but light represses expression of the gene
    + Analysis of a genomic clone of OSIAGP revealed that its promoter contains several pollen-specificity and light-regulatory elements
    + During differential screening of inflorescence-specific cDNA libraries from Oryza sativa indica, an arabinogalactan protein (OSIAGP) cDNA (586 bp) expressing preferentially in the inflorescence has been isolated
