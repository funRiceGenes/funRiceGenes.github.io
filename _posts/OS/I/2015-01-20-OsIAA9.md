* **Key message**  
    + Constitutive Expression of OsIAA9 Affects Starch Granules Accumulation and Root Gravitropic Response in Arabidopsis.
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsIAA9 have increased number of lateral roots, and reduced gravitropic response
    + Taken together, our study showed that OsIAA9 is a transcriptional repressor, and it regulates gravitropic response when expressed in Arabidopsis by regulating granules accumulation and distribution in root tips
    + Further analysis showed that OsIAA9 transgenic Arabidopsis plants accumulated fewer granules in their root tips and the distribution of granules was also affected
    + RT-PCR results showed that expression of OsIAA9 was induced by exogenously applied auxin, suggesting that OsIAA9 is an auxin response gene
    + When transfected into protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of Arabidopsis, OsIAA9 repressed reporter gene expression, and the repression was partially released by exogenously IAA
    + By generating transgenic plants expressing GFP-OsIAA9 and examining florescence in the transgenic plants, we found that OsIAA9 is localized in the nucleus
    + Bioinformatic analysis showed that OsIAA9 has a repressor motif in Domain I, a degron in Domain II, and the conserved amino acid signatures for protein-protein interactions in Domain III and Domain IV

* **Connection**  
    + __OsIAA9__, __SOR1__, [E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.%5BTitle%5D),  SOR1 physically interacts with OsIAA26 and OsIAA9, which are atypical and canonical Aux/IAA proteins, respectively
    + __OsIAA9__, __SOR1__, [E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.%5BTitle%5D),  SOR1 targets OsIAA26 for ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas OsIAA9 protects the OsIAA26 protein from degradation by inhibiting the E3 activity of SOR1
