* **Key message**  
    + Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively
    + Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
    + Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
    + Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that OsCPK29 interacts in vitro as well as in vivo with the MADS68 transcription factor which is a known regulator of pollen development
    + OsCPK29 interacts with MADS68 to regulate pollen development in rice.
    + Therefore, phenotypic observations and molecular studies suggest that OsCPK29 is an important regulator of pollen development in rice
    + Here, we report the functional characterization of a novel OsCPK29 from rice, which is mainly expressed during pollen maturation stages of the anther
    + OsCPK29 knockdown rice plants exhibit reduced fertility, set fewer seeds, and produce collapsed non-viable pollen grains that do not germinate
    + OsCPK29 exclusively localizes in the nucleus, and its N-terminal variable domain is responsible for retaining it in the nucleus
