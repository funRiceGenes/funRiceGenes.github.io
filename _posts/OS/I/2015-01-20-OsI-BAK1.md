    + Down regulation of OsI-BAK1 caused a reduction in cell number and enlargement in leaf bulliform cells
    + Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsI-BAK1 were demonstrated to have corrugated and twisted leaves probably due to increased cell number that caused abnormal bulliform cell structure which were enlarged and plugged deep into leaf epidermis
    + The current findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 may play an important role in the developmental processes of rice grain filling and leaf cell including the bulliform cells
    + Histological analyses demonstrated that embryos were either absent or retarded in their development in these unfilled rice grains of OsI-BAK1 RNAi plants
    + Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene OsI-BAK1 Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.
    + These findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit
    + Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene
    + Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein OsI-BAK1 in rice localizes to the plasma membrane
