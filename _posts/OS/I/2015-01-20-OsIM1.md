## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice Oryza sativa L. with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice Oryza sativa L. with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress%5BTitle%5D),  Sequence analysis revealed that the amino-acid sequence of OsIM1 showed 66% and 62% identity with PTOX from tomato  Capsicum annuum and AtIM from Arabidopsis, both of which encoded chloroplast-orientated terminal oxidase
2. __ ABA __, [A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice Oryza sativa L. with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice Oryza sativa L. with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress%5BTitle%5D),  The Northern blot revealed that OsIM1 was up-regulated by NaCl and ABA treatment
3. __salt stress__, [A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice Oryza sativa L. with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice Oryza sativa L. with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress%5BTitle%5D), " RT-PCR analysis indicated that OsIM1 and OsIM2 co-existed in the OsIM transcript pool, and the ratio of OsIM1/ OsIM2 was differentially regulated by salt stress in the salt-sensitive variety and the salt-tolerant varieties
