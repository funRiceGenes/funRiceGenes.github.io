* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsIAA12  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g43410](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g43410)

* **Publication**  
    + [SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, PLoS Genet.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + LC3 deficiency results in increased leaf inclination and enhanced expressions of OsIAA12 and OsGH3
    + Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
