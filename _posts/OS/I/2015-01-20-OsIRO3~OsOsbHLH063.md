    + RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively
    + CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified
    + Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 was less than that in wild-type plants
    + OsIRO3 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with a higher level in leaf blades at the vegetative growth stage
    + Knockout of OsIRO3 resulted in a hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency, with severe necrosis on young leaves and defective root development
    + OsIRO3 Plays an Essential Role in Iron Deficiency Responses and Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice
    + However, the molecular mechanisms by which OsIRO3 regulate Fe homeostasis is unclear
    + Here, we report that OsIRO3 is essential for responding to Fe deficiency and maintaining Fe homeostasis in rice
    + Thus, we conclude that OsIRO3 plays a key role in responding to Fe deficiency and regulates NA levels by directly, negatively regulating the OsNAS3 expression
    + A Model to Incorporate the bHLH Transcription Factor OsIRO3 within the Rice Iron Homeostasis Regulatory Network.
    + We place our results in the context of the existing literature and generate a model describing the role of OsIRO3 in rice Fe homeostasis and reinforce the essential function of OsIRO3 in the rice Fe deficiency response
    + Further analysis revealed that OsIRO3 directly regulated the expression of IRON-RELATED BHLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2 (OsIRO2), which encodes a positive regulator of the Fe uptake system
    + Loss-of-function of OsIRO3 caused upregulation of Fe deficiency-associated genes in the root
    + OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.
    + Further investigation demonstrated that OsIRO3 interacted with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1(OsPRI1) and OsPRI2, and
    + This work sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which OsIRO3 modulates Fe homeostasis in rice
    + OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2
