    + RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively
    + CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified
    + Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 was less than that in wild-type plants
    + OsIRO3 is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with a higher level in leaf blades at the vegetative growth stage
    + Knockout of OsIRO3 resulted in a hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency, with severe necrosis on young leaves and defective root development
    + OsIRO3 Plays an Essential Role in Iron Deficiency Responses and Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice
    + However, the molecular mechanisms by which OsIRO3 regulate Fe homeostasis is unclear
    + Here, we report that OsIRO3 is essential for responding to Fe deficiency and maintaining Fe homeostasis in rice
    + Thus, we conclude that OsIRO3 plays a key role in responding to Fe deficiency and regulates NA levels by directly, negatively regulating the OsNAS3 expression
