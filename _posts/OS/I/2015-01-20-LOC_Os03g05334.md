* **Key message**  
    + An analysis of transgenic plants showed that OsIPS1/2 are independently responsive to Pi signalling and are mainly expressed in lateral roots and in the vascular cylinder in the primary root
    + Accumulation of the mRNA of OsIPS1/2 was examined by northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in whole-root and split-root experiments under treatment with phosphate (Pi) and the Pi analogue phosphite (Phi)
    + OsIPS1 showed much higher mRNA accumulation in roots than OsIPS2, and an opposite trend was seen in shoots
    + OsIPS1/2 showed both systemic and local responses to Pi starvation, and less than 10% of the overall induced mRNA level was due to the local Pi concentration in roots
    + Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones

* **Connection**  
    + __OsIPS1__, __OsMYB2P-1__, [OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j
