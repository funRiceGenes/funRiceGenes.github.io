## Expression information
__Expression__:Identification of cis-elements and evaluation of upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, conferring pollen-specific expression in Oryza sativa (L.) ssp. indica. |  OSIPP3-∆1 (1504 bp), OSIPP3-∆2 (968 bp), OSIPP3-∆3 (388 bp) and OSIPP3-∆4 (286 bp) through the expression of transgene GUS in rice |  The qRT-PCR analysis of GUS transcript revealed 23-fold higher expression of GUS transcript in OSIPP3-Δ1 followed by OSIPP3-Δ2 (eightfold) and OSIPP3-Δ3 (threefold) when compared to OSIPP3-Δ4

## Key message
1. __pollen__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  Pollen-specific expression was observed in case of plants harboring OSIPP3_del4 construct
2. __pollen__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  It can, therefore, be concluded that the OSIPP3 URR between -178 and +108 bp is necessary for conferring pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis
3. __pollen__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D), A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis
4. __root__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OSIPP3_del1 and del2 transgenic plants showed GUS expression in root, anther and silique, while OSIPP3_del3 showed GUS activity only in anthers and siliques
5. __inflorescence__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D), OSIPP3 gene (coding for pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein) was isolated from a pre-pollinated inflorescence-specific cDNA library by differential screening of stage-specific libraries from Oryza sativa
6. __spikelet__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OSIPP3 gene was expressed exclusively in the pre-pollinated spikelets of rice
7. __anther__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  OSIPP3_del1 and del2 transgenic plants showed GUS expression in root, anther and silique, while OSIPP3_del3 showed GUS activity only in anthers and siliques
8. __anther__, [A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D), A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis
