* **Key message**  
    + Pollen-specific expression was observed in case of plants harboring OSIPP3_del4 construct
    + It can, therefore, be concluded that the OSIPP3 URR between -178 and +108 bp is necessary for conferring pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis
    + A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis
    + OSIPP3_del1 and del2 transgenic plants showed GUS expression in root, anther and silique, while OSIPP3_del3 showed GUS activity only in anthers and siliques
    + OSIPP3 gene (coding for pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein) was isolated from a pre-pollinated inflorescence-specific cDNA library by differential screening of stage-specific libraries from Oryza sativa
    + OSIPP3 gene was expressed exclusively in the pre-pollinated spikelets of rice
