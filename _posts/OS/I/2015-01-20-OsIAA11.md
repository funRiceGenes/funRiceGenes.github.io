* **Key message**  
    + Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development
    + The gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development
    + The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia
    + Taken together, the results indicate that the gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice
    + A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice
    + The auxin reporter DR5-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) was expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in wild-type, indicating that OsIAA11 is involved in auxin signaling in root caps
    + The transcript abundance of both OsPIN1b and OsPIN10a was diminished in root tips of the Osiaa11 mutant
    + Rice Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase (OsIPK2) Directly Interacts with OsIAA11 to Regulate Lateral Root Formation.
    + Furthermore, expressing additional OsIPK2 or its N-terminal amino acid sequence enhanced the accumulation of OsIAA11 protein in transgenic plants, which in turn caused defects in lateral root formation and auxin response
    + OsIAA11 and its Arabidopsis homologue AtIAA14 are key players in lateral rooting
    + By contrast, OsIAA11 is strictly required for lateral rooting in the rice PR, meaning the OsIAA11 pathway is the only choice for callus initiation
