* **Key message**  
    + Rice protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunits OsINH2 and OsINH3 participate actively in growth and adaptive responses under abscisic acid.
    + In a nutshell, this research enlightened the involvement of OsINH2 and OsINH3 in the reproductive growth of rice and adaptive strategies under stress
    + The mutation in OsINH2 and OsINH3 reduced pollen viability, thereby affected rice fertility
