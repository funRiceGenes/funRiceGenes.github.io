* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene
    + Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice
    + Here, we provide evidence that an OPR family gene in rice chromosome 8, designated OsOPR7, encodes the enzyme involved in the JA biosynthesis
    + 5 h of mechanical wounding and drought stress, and the endogenous JA level started to increase in accordance with the increase in OsOPR7 expression
    + We conclude that the OsOPR7 gene encodes the enzyme catalysing the reduction of natural (+)-cis-OPDA for the JA biosynthesis in rice
    + Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests confirmed that OG1 encodes a peroxisome-localized 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase-a key enzyme that reduces the precursor of JA
    + Loss-of-function of OG1 resulted in almost no JA accumulation
    + Exogenous JA treatment completely rescued the defects caused by the og1 mutation
    + Although both, Plant PeptoQ and ectopic OsOPR7, were acting in parallel and mostly additive, there are two specific differences: (i) OsOPR7 is strictly localised to the peroxisomes, while Plant PeptoQ found in mitochondria
    + (ii) Plant PeptoQ activates transcripts of NAC, a factor involved in retrograde signalling from mitochondria to the nucleus, while these transcripts are suppressed significantly in the cells overexpressing OsOPR7
    + The jasmonate biosynthesis Gene OsOPR7 can mitigate salinity induced mitochondrial oxidative stress.
