* **Key message**  
    + Although there are two osmotin genes in rice, OsOSM1 is the one mainly expressed in leaf sheath at the booting stage, coinciding with the critical stage of SB development in the field
    + Overexpression of OsOSM1 Enhances Resistance to Rice Sheath Blight
    + In this study, we found that overexpression of the OsOSM1 gene, encoding an osmotin protein belonging to the pathogenesis-related protein 5 family, is able to improve rice resistance to SB in field tests
    + Overexpression of OsOSM1 (OsOSM1ox) in susceptible variety Xudao 3 significantly increases resistance to SB in transgenic rice
    + The OsOSM1 mRNA levels in different transgenic lines are found to be positively correlated with their SB resistance levels
    + Intriguingly, although extremely high levels of OsOSM1 were detrimental to rice development, appropriately elevated levels of OsSOM1 were obtained that enhanced rice SB resistance without affecting rice development or grain yield
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsOSM1 plays an important role in defense against rice SB disease and provides a new target for engineering resistance to SB
    + OsOSM1 is upregulated by jasmonic acid (JA); furthermore, JA-responsive marker genes are induced in OsOSM1ox lines
