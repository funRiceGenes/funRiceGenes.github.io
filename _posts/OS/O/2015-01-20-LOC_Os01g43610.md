* **Key message**  
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
    + Also, we found that OsOFP2 was expressed in plant vasculature and determined that putative vascular development KNOX and BELL proteins interact with OsOFP2
    + We propose that OsOFP2 could modulate KNOX-BELL function to control diverse aspects of development including vasculature development
    + Reduced expression of the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA 20-oxidase 7 coincided with lower gibberellin content in OsOFP2 overexpression lines
    + OsOFP2 was found to localize to the nucleus and to the cytosol
