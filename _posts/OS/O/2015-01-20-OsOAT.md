* **Key message**  
    + In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress
    + An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
    + We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2
    + Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions
    + Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT
    + Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance
    + OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments
    + In the Osoat mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence
    + Therefore, OsOAT is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice
