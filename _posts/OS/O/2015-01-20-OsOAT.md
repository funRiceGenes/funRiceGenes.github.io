    + In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress
    + An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
    + We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2
    + Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions
    + Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT
    + Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance
    + OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments
    + In the Osoat mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence
    + Therefore, OsOAT is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice
    + osoat mutant was identified as a temperature-sensitive male sterile mutant with deformed floral organs and seedlings sensitive to cold stress
    + Ornithine 未-aminotransferase OsOAT is critical for male fertility and cold tolerance during rice plant development.
    + Moreover, indica varieties carrying WYG-type OsOAT generally have higher seed-setting rates than those carrying HHZ-type OsOAT under cold stress at reproductive stage, highlighting the favorable selection for WYG-type OsOAT during domestication and breeding to cope with low temperatures
    + Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that OsOAT mutation and cold treatment of the wild-type plant led to similar changes in the global gene expression profiles in anthers
    + OsOAT genes in indica rice Huanghuazhan (HHZ) and japonica rice Wuyungeng (WYG) are different in gene structure and response to cold
