* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Since OsOFP14 is a member of a transcription suppressor family, we speculated that OsOFP14 antagonistically or synergistically modulates GS9 activity.
    + GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.
