* **Key message**  
    + The gain-of-function mutant Osofp8 and OsOFP8 overexpression lines showed enhanced lamina joint inclination, whereas OsOFP8 RNAi transgenic lines showed more upright leaf phenotype, which suggest that OsOFP8 is involved in BR responses
    + These results indicate that OsOFP8 is a substrate of OsGSK2 and the function of OsOFP8 in plant growth and development is at least partly through the BR signaling pathway
    + Here we report in rice that OsOFP8 plays a positive role in BR signaling pathway
    + The phospphorylated OsOFP8 shuttles to the cytoplasm and is targeted for proteasomal degradation
