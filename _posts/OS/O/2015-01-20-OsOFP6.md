    + OsOFP6 was shown to interfere with auxin in regulating lateral root growth and initiation, as RNAi plants had increased density of lateral roots under IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) treatment
    + Here, we report that rice OsOFP6 regulates growth and development, and alters responses to drought and cold stresses
    + Knock-down of OsOFP6 by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in semi-dwarf stature, altered grain shape, and shorter lateral roots
    + Furthermore, under drought conditions OE lines showed slower water loss and less accumulation of H2O2 compared with RNAi plants, which displayed faster water loss and higher H2O2, implying that OsOFP6 may confer both drought avoidance and drought tolerance in rice plants
    + In addition, under cold treatment OE and RNAi plants exhibited lower and higher relative electrical conductivity (REC), respectively, suggesting an important role of OsOFP6 in response to cold stress
    + OsOFP6 also affects polar auxin transport, which was demonstrated by the different responses of RNAi and OsOFP6-overexpression (OE) plants to treatment with N-1-naphthylphalamic acid (NPA)
    + Transgenic plants with knock-down of OsOFP6 by RNA interference showed increased leaf angle, which resulted from the thinner secondary cell wall with reduced amounts of cellulose and lignin, whilst overexpression of OsOFP6 in rice led to the thinker secondary cell wall with increased lignin content
    + Taken together, our study provides insights into the function of OsOFP6 in regulating leaf angle and the control of biosynthesis of secondary cell wall
    + The interaction of OsOFP6 and OSH15 enhanced the transcriptional activity of OSH15 which binds to the promoter of OsIRX9 (Oryza sativa IRREGULAR XYLEM 9)
