## Key message

## Connection
1. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  The protein-protein interaction in homo- and hetero-combinations between LIP19 and OsOBF1 was confirmed in vitro and in planta
2. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  LIP19 and OsOBF1 most likely interact with each other more strongly than OsOBF1 interacts with itself, and the resulting heterodimer binds to the C/G hybrid sequence but not to the hexamer sequence
