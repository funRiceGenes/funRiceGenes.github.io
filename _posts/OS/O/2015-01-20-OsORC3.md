* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsORC3 was strongly expressed in regions of active cell proliferation, including the primary root tip, stem base, lateral root primordium, emerged lateral root primordium, lateral root tip, young shoot, anther and ovary
    + OsORC3 knockdown plants lacked lateral roots and had a dwarf phenotype
    + Our results indicate that OsORC3 plays a crucial role in the emergence of lateral root primordia
    + OsORC3 is required for lateral root development in rice
