    + [OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, J Exp Bot.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants expressing pOsOASTL-A1::GUS suggested that OsOASTL-A1 was strongly expressed in the outer cortex and the vascular cylinder in the root mature zone
    + Tissue expression analysis revealed that OsOASTL-A1 mainly expressed in roots at the vegetative growth stage and in nodes at the reproductive stage
    + OsOASTL-A1 functions as a cytosolic cysteine synthase and affects arsenic tolerance in rice.
    + Knockout of OsOASTL-A1 led to significantly lower levels of cysteine, glutathione and phytochelatins in roots and increased sensitivity to arsenate stress
