* **Key message**  
    + OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
    + The level of OsORC1 expression was significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium
    + When the growth-halted cells began to re-grow following addition of sucrose to the medium, OsORC1 was again expressed at high levels
