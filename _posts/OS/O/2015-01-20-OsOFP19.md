* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)
    + OsOFP19 modulates plant architecture by integrating cell division pattern and brassinosteroid signaling.
    + Further studies revealed that OsOFP19 interacts with OSH1, and this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of each other and leads to a transition from anticlinal to periclinal cell division
    + SlOFP20 overexpression altered the expression levels of some brassinosteroid (BR)-associated genes, implying that SlOFP20 may play a negative role in the BR response, similar to its ortholog OsOFP19 in rice
