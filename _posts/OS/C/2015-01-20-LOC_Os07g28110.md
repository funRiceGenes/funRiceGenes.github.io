* **Key message**  
    + The putative obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase OsCYP51H3 affects multiple aspects of rice growth and development.
    + The RNA-seq results showed that OsCYP51H3 may affect the expression of a lot of genes related to rice development
    + These findings showed that OsCYP51H3 codes for a putative obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase involved in phytosterol and BR biosynthesis, and mediates rice development
    + Metabolomic analysis of oscyp51H3 mutant indicated that OsCYP51H3 may also encode an obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase involved in phytosterol and BR biosynthesis, but possibly not that of triterpenes
    + Compared with wild type, the mutants oscyp51H3 and OsCYP51H3-RNAi showed dwarf phenotype, late flowering, erected leaves, lower seed-setting rate and smaller and shorter seeds
