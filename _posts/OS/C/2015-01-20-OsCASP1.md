* **Key message**  
    + OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS
    + These results indicated that OsCASP1 is required for CS formation at the endodermis and that the CS in rice plays an important role in root selective uptake of mineral elements especially Ca and Si
    + Knockout of OsCASP1 resulted in defect of CS formation at the endodermis and decreased growth under both soil and hydroponic conditions
    + Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice
    + Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice
