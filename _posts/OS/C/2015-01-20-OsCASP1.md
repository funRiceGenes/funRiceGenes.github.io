* **Key message**  
    + OsCASP1 was mainly expressed in the root elongation zone, and the protein encoded was first localized to all side of the plasma membrane of endodermal cells without CS, followed by to the middle of anticlinal side of endodermal cells with CS
    + These results indicated that OsCASP1 is required for CS formation at the endodermis and that the CS in rice plays an important role in root selective uptake of mineral elements especially Ca and Si
    + Knockout of OsCASP1 resulted in defect of CS formation at the endodermis and decreased growth under both soil and hydroponic conditions
    + Overexpression of OsCASP1 Improves Calcium Tolerance in Rice
    + Here, we demonstrated that OsCASP1 overexpression enhanced Ca tolerance in rice
    + Our findings suggest that OsCASP1 could play an important role in nutrient homeostasis and adaptation to the growth environment
    + Rice OsCASP1 orchestrates Casparian strip formation and suberin deposition in small lateral roots to maintain nutrient homeostasis.
    + Here, we observed the structure of rice primary and small lateral roots (SLRs), particularly the deposition patterns of lignin and suberin in wild type and Oscasp1 mutants
    + The loss of OsCASP1 function alters the expression of the genes involved in suberin biosynthesis and the deposition of suberin in the endodermis and sclerenchyma and leads to delayed CS formation and uneven lignin deposition in SLRs
