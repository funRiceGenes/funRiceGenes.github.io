* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
    + GUS assay with the T-DNA tagged line indicated that the OsCP1 promoter was highly active in the rice anther
    + Taken together, the results demonstrated that OsCP1 is a cysteine protease gene that might play an important role in pollen development
