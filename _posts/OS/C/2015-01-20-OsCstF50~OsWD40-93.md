## Connection
1. __OsCstF50~OsWD40-93__, __OsFY__, [Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY%5BTitle%5D),  We found that OsFY could bind OsCstF50, whereas the OsCstF77 protein could bridge the interaction between OsCstF50 and OsCstF64
2. __OsCstF50~OsWD40-93__, __OsCstF64__, [Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY%5BTitle%5D),  We found that OsFY could bind OsCstF50, whereas the OsCstF77 protein could bridge the interaction between OsCstF50 and OsCstF64
