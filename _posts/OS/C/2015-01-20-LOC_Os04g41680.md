* **Key message**  
    + Identification of an E-box motif responsible for the expression of jasmonic acid-induced chitinase gene OsChia4a in rice
    + The recombinant protein of His-tagged OsChia4a exhibited an inhibitory effect against the spore germination and hyphal growth of Magnaporthe oryzae
    + These results imply that a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is likely to be involved in the regulation of the OsChia4a expression in a JA-dependent manner
