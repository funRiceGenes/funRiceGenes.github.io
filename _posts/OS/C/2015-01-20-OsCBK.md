## Key message
1. __anther__, [Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis
2. __growth__, [Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development
3. __meiosis__, [Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis
4. __vegetative__, [Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development
5. __reproductive__, [Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development
6. __cell division__, [Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis

## Connection
1. __OsCaM61__, __OsCBK__, [Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61%5BTitle%5D)),  It was observed that OsCaM61 stimulated OsCBK in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner
2. __OsCaM61__, __OsCBK__, [Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutational study and fluorescent spectroscopy analysis indicated that CaM-binding affinity does not correlate with the kinase activity and that these key amino-acids in OsCaM61 play a vital role in suitable changes of OsCBK conformation for kinase activation
