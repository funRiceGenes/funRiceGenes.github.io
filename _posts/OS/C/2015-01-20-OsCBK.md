* **Key message**  
    + OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis
    + In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCaM61__, __OsCBK__, [Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61%5BTitle%5D), It was observed that OsCaM61 stimulated OsCBK in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner
