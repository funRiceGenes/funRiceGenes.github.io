* **Key message**  
    + Collectively, these results show that the natural variation at OsCG5 may contribute towards rice grain quality under heat stress
    + Accessions with lower transcript abundance of OsCG5 exhibit higher chalkiness, which correlates with higher RG values under stress
    + These findings are supported by increased chalkiness of OsCG5 knock-out (KO) mutants relative to wildtype (WT) under heat stress
    + Grains from plants overexpressing OsCG5 are less chalky than KOs but comparable to WT under heat stress
