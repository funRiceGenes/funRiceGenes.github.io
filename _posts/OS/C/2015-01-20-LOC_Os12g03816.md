* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus
    + Taken together, OsCML3 probably provides a mechanism for manipulating the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 in the nucleus and its C-terminal extension provides an intracellular Ca(2+) regulatory switch
