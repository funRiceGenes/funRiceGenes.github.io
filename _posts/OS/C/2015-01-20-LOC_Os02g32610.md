* **Key message**  
    + Yield-related agronomic traits, including flowering time and effective tiller number, were altered in osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines
    + The osctr2 loss-of-function mutation and expression of the 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgene that encodes the OsCTR2 N terminus (residues 1-513) revealed several and many aspects, respectively, of ethylene-induced growth alteration in rice
    + Because the osctr2 allele did not produce all aspects of ethylene-induced growth alteration, the ethylene-receptor signal output might be mediated in part by OsCTR2 and by other components in rice
    + Our understanding of roles of ethylene in various aspects of growth and development in japonica rice varieties could be advanced with the use of the osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines
    + Arabidopsis ethylene receptors ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 and ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 physically interacted with OsCTR2 on yeast two-hybrid assay, and green fluorescence protein-tagged OsCTR2 was localized at the endoplasmic reticulum

    + __MHZ11__, __OsCTR2__, [The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.%5BTitle%5D),  Genetically, MHZ11 acts at the ethylene receptor OsERS2 upstream of OsCTR2 and OsEIN2
    + __MHZ11__, __OsCTR2__, [The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.%5BTitle%5D),  MHZ11 mutation maintains more OsCTR2 in phosphorylated form whereas MHZ11 overexpression promotes ethylene inhibition of OsCTR2 phosphorylation
    + __MHZ11__, __OsCTR2__, [The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.%5BTitle%5D),  MHZ11 co-localized with the ethylene receptor OsERS2, and its effect on OsCTR2 phosphorylation requires ethylene perception and signaling initiation
    + __MHZ11__, __OsCTR2__, [The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.%5BTitle%5D),  Blocking sterol biosynthesis partially rescued mhz11 ethylene response likely by reducing receptor-OsCTR2 interaction and OsCTR2 phosphorylation
    + __MHZ11__, __OsCTR2__, [The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.%5BTitle%5D),  We propose that MHZ11 works to reduce sterol level to impair receptor-OsCTR2 interaction and OsCTR2 phosphorylation for triggering of signaling upon ethylene treatment
