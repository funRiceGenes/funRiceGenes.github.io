1. __cell wall__, [Cell Wall Invertase in Developing Rice Caryopsis: Molecular Cloning of OsCIN1 and Analysis of its Expression in Relation to its Role in Grain Filling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cell Wall Invertase in Developing Rice Caryopsis: Molecular Cloning of OsCIN1 and Analysis of its Expression in Relation to its Role in Grain Filling%5BTitle%5D),  During the course of grain filling in the caryopses, OsCIN1 transcript is detectable only in the very early stage of their development, 1~4 d after flowering, when the cell wall invertase activity is the highest and the increase in caryopsis length is rapid

5. __GIF1~OsCIN2__, __OsCIN1__, [Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of GIF1 and OsCIN1 also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that OsCIN1 might regulate other unrecognized biological process
6. __GIF1~OsCIN2__, __OsCIN1__, [Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Our discovery that the duplicated pair of GIF1 and OsCIN1 has experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop
