* **Key message**  
    + Further study indicated that OsCUC1 physically interacts with leaf-rolling related protein CURLED LEAF AND DWARF 1 (CLD1) and stabilizes it in the nucleus to control leaf morphology
    + In addition, knockout of OsCUC1 leads to multiple defects, including dwarf plant architecture, male sterility and twisted-rolling leaves
    + A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant
