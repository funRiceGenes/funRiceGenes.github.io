* **Key message**  
    + In contrast, assessment of growth inhibition upon exogenous application of JA to seedlings of each mutant revealed that rice COIs are redundantly involved in shoot growth, whereas OsCOI2 plays a primary role in root growth
    + The oscoi2 mutants, but not the oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants, exhibited severely low fertility, indicating the crucial role of OsCOI2 in rice fertility
    + Genome Editing Reveals both the Crucial Role of OsCOI2 in Jasmonate Signaling, and the Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice Functional Diversity of COI1 Homologs in Rice.
    + Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptional changes after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment were moderate in the leaves of oscoi2 mutants compared to those in the wild-type or oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants
    + These results indicate that OsCOI2 plays a central role in JA response in rice leaves
    + MeJA-induced chlorophyll degradation and accumulation of antimicrobial secondary metabolites were suppressed in oscoi2 mutants
    + OsCOI1b is involved in root growth and grain-size control and plays overlapping roles with OsCOI1a in spikelet development, while OsCOI2 regulates leaf senescence, male sterility, root growth, and grain size
    + OsCOI2 binds to most individual OsJAZs in the presence of endogenous JA ligands, as OsCOI1a /1b do, albeit with greater partner selectivity
    + However, the defense sectors regulated by OsCOI1a/1b and OsCOI2 clearly differed
