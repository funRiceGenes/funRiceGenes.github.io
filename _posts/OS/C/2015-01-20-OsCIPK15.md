* **Key message**  
    + On the other hand, TvX/EIX-induced cell death was enhanced in OsCIPK15-overexpressing lines
    + We here identified two CIPKs, OsCIPK14 and OsCIPK15, rapidly induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns, including chitooligosaccharides and xylanase (Trichoderma viride/ethylene-inducing xylanase [TvX/EIX]), in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively
