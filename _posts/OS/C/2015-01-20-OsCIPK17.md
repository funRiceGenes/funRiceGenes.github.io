    + Functional Analysis of OsCIPK17 in Rice Grain Filling.
    + The results showed that knockout of OsCIPK17 affected photosynthesis and starch-, sucrose-, and amino acid metabolism-related gene expression; furthermore, the mutation reduced PSII utilization efficiency, it blocked the synthesis and metabolism of starch and sucrose, and affected the formation and transport of assimilates, thereby reducing final grain weight
