* **Key message**  
    + The oscbt-1 mutant exhibits reduced levels of OsCBT transcripts and no significant morphological changes compared to wild-type plant although the growth of the mutant is stunted
    + The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice
    + OsCBT was able to bind this sequence and activate beta-glucuronidase reporter gene expression driven by a minimal promoter containing tandem repeats of these sequences in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts
    + Taken together, the results support an idea that OsCBT might act as a negative regulator on plant defense
    + This factor, which we have designated OsCBT (Oryza sativa CaM-binding transcription factor), has structural features similar to Arabidopsis AtSRs/AtCAMTAs and encodes a 103-kDa protein because it contains a CG-1 homology DNA-binding domain, three ankyrin repeats, a putative transcriptional activation domain, and five putative CaM-binding motifs
