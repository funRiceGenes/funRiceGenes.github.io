* **Key message**  
    + However, its expression pattern in response to hormones and abiotic stresses was somehow different from those of the OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes
    + OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes were commonly upregulated in dry seeds and by ABA and salt/drought stresses, implying their involvement in ABA-mediated processes

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCUL1-1__, __OsMBTB32__, [OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We further found that OsCUL1 proteins, particularly OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3, interact with OsMBTB32 and may suppress the function of OsMBTB32 during salt stress
    + __OsCUL1-1__, __OsMBTB32__, [OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, OsWRKY42, a homolog of ZmWRKY114 which negatively regulates salt stress in rice, directly binds to the W-box of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 promoters to promote the interaction of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 with OsMBTB32 protein in rice
