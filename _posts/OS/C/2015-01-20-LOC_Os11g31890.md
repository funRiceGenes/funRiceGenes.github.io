* **Key message**  
    + Loss of OsCPL3 function resulted in higher OsGSK2 abundance and lower OsBZR1 levels, leading to decreased BR responsiveness and alterations in plant morphology including semi-dwarfism, leaf erectness and grain size, which are of fundamental importance to crop productivity
    + OsCPL3 localized to the nucleus, where it dephosphorylated OsGSK2 at the Ser-222 and Thr-284 residues to modulate its protein turnover and kinase activity, in turn affecting the degradation of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BR signaling
    + OsCPL3 is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability.
    + OsCPL3 expression was widely detected in various tissues and organs including roots, leaves and lamina joints, and was induced by exogenous BR treatment
    + These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for OsCPL3 and add another layer of complexity to the tightly controlled BR signaling pathway in plants
