* **Key message**  
    + There was also a corresponding increase in the protein and the enzyme activity of OscTPI both in shoot and root tissues under MG stress
    + Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice
    + Real time PCR analysis revealed that OscTPI transcript level was regulated in response to various abiotic stresses
