## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+%5BTitle%5D),  OsCAX1a mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca2+)  
2. __homeostasis__, [Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsCAX1a transports Ca2+ into vacuoles and is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca2+)  
3. __flower__, [Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
4. __vascular bundle__, [Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
5. __stomata__, [Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
6. __stomata__, [Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+%5BTitle%5D),  In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of OsCAX1a was particularly high in aged organs
