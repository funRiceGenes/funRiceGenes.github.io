* **Key message**  
    + OsCAX1a mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca(2+)
    + These results suggest that OsCAX1a transports Ca(2+) into vacuoles and is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca(2+)
    + Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers
    + In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of OsCAX1a was particularly high in aged organs
