* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptome analysis revealed that the transcript level of OsGOLDEN-LIKE1 (OsGLK1), which encodes a transcription factor that regulates plastid development and maintenance, was significantly higher in the OsCPPR1 knockdown plants compared to wild-type plants
    + Knocking down OsCPPR1 led to abnormal plastid development in tapetal cells, prolonged tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and tapetum degradation, and significantly reduced pollen fertility
    + We therefore conclude that OsCPPR1 suppresses OsGLK1 in the regulation of plastid development and PCD in the tapetum
    + Overexpression of OsGLK1 resulted in abnormal tapetum and plastid development, similar to that seen in OsCPPR1 knockdown plants, and suppression of OsGLK1 partially restored pollen fertility in the OsCPPR1 knockdown plants
