* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 led to a typical BR enhanced phenotype, with enlarged leaf angle and increased grain size
    + The overall growth and development of oscpd1 and oscpd2 single knock-out mutants was indistinguishable from the wild-type, whereas, the oscpd1 oscpd2 double mutant displayed multiple and obvious BR-related defects
    + OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.
    + There is still no genetic evidence so far about the requirement of OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 in rice BR biosynthesis
    + Taken together, our results provide direct genetic evidence that OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 play essential and redundant roles in maintenance of plant architecture by modulating BR biosynthesis in rice
    + Cytological analyses further indicated the defective cell elongation in oscpd1 oscpd2 double mutant
