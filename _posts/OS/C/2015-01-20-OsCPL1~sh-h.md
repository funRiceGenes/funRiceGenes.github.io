* **Key message**  
    + The locus sh-h for shattering was tightly linked to the Rc locus conferring red pericarp, as well as a QTL qSD(s)-7-1 for seed dormancy, implying that this region might represent a domestication block in the evolutionary pathway of rice
    + On the basis of the BTS value and morphology of the abscission layer of F(1) plants and segregation data in F(2) populations, it was concluded that the easy shattering of Hsh was controlled by the single recessive gene sh-h
    + Inactivation of the CTD phosphatase-like gene OsCPL1 enhances the development of the abscission layer and seed shattering in rice
    + We previously identified a recessive shattering locus, sh-h, from the rice shattering mutant line Hsh that carries an enhanced abscission layer
    + Two transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants and one point mutant exhibited the enhanced shattering phenotype, confirming that LOC_Os07g10690 is indeed the sh-h gene
    + These results demonstrate that OsCPL1 represses differentiation of the abscission layer during panicle development
