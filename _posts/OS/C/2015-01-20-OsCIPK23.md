## Key message
1. __drought tolerance__, [Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), " In consistent, overexpression of OsCIPK23 induced the expression of several drought tolerance related genes"
2. __seed__, [Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  RNA interference-mediated suppression of OsCIPK23 expression significantly reduced seed set and conferred a hypersensitive response to drought stress, indicating its possible roles in pollination and drought stress
3. __drought__, [Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), " RNA interference-mediated suppression of OsCIPK23 expression significantly reduced seed set and conferred a hypersensitive response to drought stress, indicating its possible roles in pollination and drought stress
