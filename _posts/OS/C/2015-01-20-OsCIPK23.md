* **Key message**  
    + In consistent, overexpression of OsCIPK23 induced the expression of several drought tolerance related genes
    + RNA interference-mediated suppression of OsCIPK23 expression significantly reduced seed set and conferred a hypersensitive response to drought stress, indicating its possible roles in pollination and drought stress
    + Taken together, these results indicate that OsCIPK23 is a multistress induced gene and likely mediates a signaling pathway commonly shared by both pollination and drought stress responses in rice
    + Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K+ content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development.
    + Consistently, increased of potassium protein kinases genes (OsAKT1, OsHAK5, OsCBL, OsCIPK23 and OsCamk1) were also recorded
    + Transcription factor network analysis revealed the importance of RGA1 in nitrogen signaling with DEGs such as Nin-like, WRKY, NAC, bHLH families, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, OsCIPK23 and urea transporter
