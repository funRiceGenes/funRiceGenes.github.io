* **Key message**  
    + We further identified a transcriptional regulatory network downstream of OsCIPK18 under NH4+ stress that is centered on several core transcription factors
    + CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase OsCIPK18 Regulates the Response of Ammonium Toxicity in Rice Roots.
    + Moreover, OsCIPK18 might function as a transmitter in the auxin and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways affected by excess ammonium
    + Differentially expressed genes induced by excess NH4+ in WT and cipk18 were associated with functions, such as ion transport, metabolism, cell wall formation, and phytohormones signaling, suggesting a fundamental role for OsCIPK18 in ammonium toxicity

    + __OsAMT1;2~OsAMT1.2__, __OsCIPK18__, [CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase OsCIPK18 Regulates the Response of Ammonium Toxicity in Rice Roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase OsCIPK18 Regulates the Response of Ammonium Toxicity in Rice Roots.%5BTitle%5D),  Transcriptome analysis reveals that OsCIPK18 affects the NH4+ uptake by regulating the expression of OsAMT1;2 and other NH4+ transporters, but does not affect ammonium assimilation
