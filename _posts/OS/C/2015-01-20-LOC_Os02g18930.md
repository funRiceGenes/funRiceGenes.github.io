* **Key message**  
    + By evaluation of the tolerance to 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20% PEG6000 and low temperature treatments, and relevant physiological indices, 8F12, a sense transgenic line with high salt tolerance, and 8R14, an antisense transgenic line with high drought tolerance, were obtained, which suggests that the OsCBL8 gene is involved in the response of rice to abiotic stresses
    + The OsCBL8 transgenic rice seedlings showed more tolerance to salt stress than non-transgenic seedlings
    + Such up- and down-regulation of the OsCBL8 gene in these transgenic lines had little effects on main agronomic traits, but significantly decreased the number of filled grains per panicle and seed setting rate in some of transgenic lines
    + Moreover, Calcineurin B-like protein 7 (OsCBL7) and OsCBL8 interact with OsCIPK7 specifically on the plasma membrane
    + This study found that OsCBL8 negatively regulated rice seed germination and seedling growth by interacting with OsCIPK17 with overexpression and gene editing mutant plants as materials combining plant phenotype, physiological indicators and transcriptome sequencing
    + Our work reveals a unique signaling pathway, wherein OsCBL8 interacts with OsCIPK17 and provides rice with multiple resistance while also regulating seedling growth
