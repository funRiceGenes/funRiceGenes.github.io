## Key message
1. __seedling__, [OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL%5BTitle%5D),  The oscpn60alpha1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared
2. __seedling__, [OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL%5BTitle%5D),  This demonstrated that OsCpn60alpha1 is required for the folding of rbcL and that failure of that process is seedling-lethal
3. __leaf__, [OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL%5BTitle%5D),  The oscpn60alpha1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared
4. __chloroplast__, [OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL%5BTitle%5D),  Transiently expressed OsCpn60alpha1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the chloroplast stroma
