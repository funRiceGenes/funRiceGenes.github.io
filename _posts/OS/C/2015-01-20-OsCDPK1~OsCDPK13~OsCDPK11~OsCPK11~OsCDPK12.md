    + Conversely, OsCDPK11 protein levels were high at the beginning of seed development, but fell rapidly from 10 DAF onwards
    + Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development
    + OsCDPK13 accumulated in 2-week-old leaf sheath and callus, and became phosphorylated in response to cold and gibberellin (GA)
    + OsCDPK13, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced by cold and gibberellin in rice leaf sheath
    + OsCDPK13, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced in response to cold and gibberellin
    + Furthermore, OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were enhanced in response to cold, but suppressed under salt and drought stresses
    + OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]
    + Recently, a full-length cDNA encoding OsCDPK13 from rice seedling was isolated
    + The results suggest that OsCDPK13 might be an important signaling component in the response of rice to GA and cold stress
    + Antisense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines were shorter than the vector control lines, and the expression of OsCDPK13 was lower in dwarf mutants of rice than in wild type
    + OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles
    + OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development
    + Sense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines had higher recovery rates after cold stress than vector control rice
    + Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of OsCDPK1 confers disease resistance by affecting OsPR10a expression in rice.
    + These results suggest that OsCDPK1 may be an upstream regulator involved in rice innate immunity and conferred broad-spectrum of disease resistance
    + The dihybrid rice Ri-1/OsPR10a-Ox not only bypassed the effect of OsCDPK1 silencing on the susceptibility to Xoo but also showed enhanced disease resistance and, consistent with Ri-1 phenotypes, increased plant height and grain size
    + Our results reveal that OsCDPK1 plays novel key roles in the cross-talk and mediation of the balance between stress response and development and provides a clue for improving grain yield and disease resistance simultaneously in rice
    + OsPR10a and OsCDPK1 showed corresponding expression patterns and were up-regulated in response to the jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and Xoo treatments, and OsPR1 and OsPR4 were significantly up-regulated in OEtr-1
    + In the study presented here, we propose a model in which OsCDPK1 plays key roles in negatively controlling the grain size, amylose content, and endosperm appearance, and also affects the physicochemical properties of the starch
    + Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of OsCDPK1 (OEtr) in rice produced smaller seeds, but a double-stranded RNA gene-silenced form of OsCDPK1 (Ri) yielded larger seeds, suggesting that OsCDPK1 plays a functional role in rice seed development
    + This demonstrates that OsCDPK1 plays a novel functional role in starch biosynthesis during seed development and affects the transparent appearance of the endosperm
