* **Key message**  
    + The rice lesion mimic mutant oscul3a displays a significant increase in the accumulation of flg22- and chitin-induced reactive oxygen species, and in pathogenesis-related gene expression as well as resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.
    + Here, we show that rice OsCUL3a is important for the regulation of cell death and immunity
    + Strikingly, OsCUL3a interacts with and degrades OsNPR1, which acts as a positive regulator of cell death in rice
    + Our data demonstrate that OsCUL3a negatively regulates cell death and immunity by degrading OsNPR1 in rice
    + We cloned the OsCUL3a gene via a map-based strategy and found that the lesion mimic phenotype of oscul3a is associated with the early termination of OsCUL3a protein
    + Furthermore, the oscul3a osnpr1 double mutant does not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the oscul3a mutant
    + In oscul3a (oscullin3a) mutants, OsCUL3a-associated molecular switches are responsible for disrupted cell metabolism that leads to increased total lipid content in rice grain, a late accumulation of H2O2 in leaves, enhanced Xoo disease resistance, and suppressed panicle and first internode growth
    + In oscul3a mutants, PRM confirmed up-regulated molecular switch proteins include lipoxygenases (CM-LOX1 and CM-LOX2), suggesting a novel connection between ferroptosis and rice lesion mimic formation
    + OsSPL88 Encodes a Cullin Protein that Regulates Rice Growth and Development.
