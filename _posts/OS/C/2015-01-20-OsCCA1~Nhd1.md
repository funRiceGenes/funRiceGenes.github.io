* **Key message**  
    + The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters.
    + Compared to the wild-type (WT), nhd1 and osamt1;3 mutants showed a similar decrease in root growth and N uptake under low NH4+ supply, while nhd1 and osnrt2
    + The defects of nhd1 mutants in NH4+ uptake and root growth response to various N supplies were restored by overexpression of OsAMT1;3 or OsNRT2
    + However, when grown in a paddy field with low N availability, nhd1 mutants accumulated more N and achieved a higher N uptake efficiency (NUpE) due to the delayed flowering time and prolonged growth period
    + Here, we show that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcription of the high-affinity ammonium (NH4+) transporter 1;3 (OsAMT1;3) and the dual affinity nitrate (NO3-) transporter 2
    + Together, our findings illustrate that OsCCA1 confers multiple abiotic stress tolerance likely by orchestrating ABA signaling, which links the circadian clock with ABA signaling in rice
    + Consistently, oscca1 null mutants generated via genome editing displayed enhanced sensitivities to ABA signaling
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsCCA1 is a likely domestication locus that has contributed to the geographic adaptation and expansion of cultivated rice
    + In the japonica cultivar &#x27;Dongjin&#x27;, a T-DNA insertion in OsCCA1a resulted in late flowering under long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that OsCCA1 is a floral inducer
    + Leaf RNA-seq analysis indicated that mutation of Nhd1 dramatically altered expression of the genes linked to starch and sucrose metabolism, circadian rhythm, and amino acid metabolic pathways
    + Knockout of Nhd1 suppressed OsSUT1 expression, and both nhd1 and ossut1 mutants showed similar shorter height, and lower shoot biomass and sucrose concentration in comparison with the wild type, while overexpression of OsSUT1 can restore the defective sucrose transport and partially ameliorate the reduced growth of nhd1 mutants
    + Here, we report that knockout of Nhd1 in rice reduced the rate of photosynthesis and the sucrose ratio of sheaths to blades, but increased the total C to N ratio and free amino acids
    + Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene OsSUT1 and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.
    + We identified that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcriptional expression of sucrose transporter-1 (OsSUT1)
    + Interestingly, we identified significant OsCCA1 binding peaks in the promoter regions of four herbicide resistance genes, including OsCYP81A12, OsCYP81E22, OsCYP76C2, and OsCYP76C4
