    + The rice transcription factor Nhd1 regulates root growth and nitrogen uptake by activating nitrogen transporters.
    + Compared to the wild-type (WT), nhd1 and osamt1;3 mutants showed a similar decrease in root growth and N uptake under low NH4+ supply, while nhd1 and osnrt2
    + The defects of nhd1 mutants in NH4+ uptake and root growth response to various N supplies were restored by overexpression of OsAMT1;3 or OsNRT2
    + However, when grown in a paddy field with low N availability, nhd1 mutants accumulated more N and achieved a higher N uptake efficiency (NUpE) due to the delayed flowering time and prolonged growth period
    + Here, we show that Nhd1 can directly activate the transcription of the high-affinity ammonium (NH4+) transporter 1;3 (OsAMT1;3) and the dual affinity nitrate (NO3-) transporter 2
    + Together, our findings illustrate that OsCCA1 confers multiple abiotic stress tolerance likely by orchestrating ABA signaling, which links the circadian clock with ABA signaling in rice
    + Consistently, oscca1 null mutants generated via genome editing displayed enhanced sensitivities to ABA signaling
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsCCA1 is a likely domestication locus that has contributed to the geographic adaptation and expansion of cultivated rice
    + In the japonica cultivar &#x27;Dongjin&#x27;, a T-DNA insertion in OsCCA1a resulted in late flowering under long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that OsCCA1 is a floral inducer
