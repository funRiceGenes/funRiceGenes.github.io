* **Key message**  
    + These results demonstrated that Oscyp71Z2 plays an important role in bacterial blight resistance by regulating the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis and H(2)O(2) generation
    + Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice
    + We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice
    + Overexpression of Oscyp71Z2 in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo at the booting stage
    + Overexpressing CYP71Z2 Enhances Resistance to Bacterial Blight by Suppressing Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice.
    + We've previously shown that the P450 gene CYP71Z2 enhances disease resistance to pathogens through regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice, though it remains unclear if auxin is involved in this process or not
    + Overexpression of CYP71Z2 in rice durably and stably increased resistance to Xoo, though no significant difference in disease resistance was detected between CYP71Z2-RNA interference (RNAi) rice and wild-type
