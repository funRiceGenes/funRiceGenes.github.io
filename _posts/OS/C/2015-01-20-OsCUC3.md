* **Key message**  
    + A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant
    + The osnam oscuc3 double mutant, however, resulted in severe leaf fusion of the first two leaves, while the osnam single mutant showed a similar phenotype from the seventh leaf
    + Loss-of-function mutants for OsCUC3 resulted in no obvious defects throughout the development of the rice
    + The results indicated that OsNAM and OsCUC3 act redundantly for boundary specification during postembryonic development
    + Overall, we have described the biological functions of OsNAM and OsCUC3 in rice development and the expression characteristics of OsNAM
