* **Key message**  
    + OsCKX4 is predominantly expressed in leaf blades and roots
    + Overexpression and RNA interference of OsCKX4 confirmed that OsCKX4 plays a positive role in crown root formation
    + Moreover, expression analysis revealed a significant alteration in the expression of auxin-related genes in the ren1-D mutants, indicating that the OsCKX4 mediates crown root development by integrating the interaction between cytokinin and auxin
    + Transgenic plants harboring OsCKX4 under the control of the root-specific promoter RCc3 displayed enhanced root development without affecting their shoot parts, suggesting that this strategy could be a powerful tool in rice root engineering
    + OsCKX4 is induced by exogenous auxin and cytokinin in the roots
    + Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3
    + Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that these phenotypes are caused by the activation of a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) family gene, OsCKX4
