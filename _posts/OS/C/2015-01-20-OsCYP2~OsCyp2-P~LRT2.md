* **Key message**  
    + OsCYP2, a chaperone involved in degradation of auxin-responsive proteins, plays crucial roles in rice lateral root initiation
    + Proteomic identification of OsCYP2, a rice cyclophilin that confers salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings when overexpressed
    + Heterologous expression of a salinity and developmentally regulated rice cyclophilin gene (OsCyp2) in E. coli and S. cerevisiae confers tolerance towards multiple abiotic stresses
    + Our results suggest that OsCYP2 participates in auxin signal transduction by interacting with OsSGT1
    + Expression of OsCyp2 enhances the ability of Escherichia coli to survive under diverse abiotic stresses viz
    + Based on these results, we propose that OsCyp2 may serve as a 'suitable candidate' for raising transgenic plants for enhanced multiple abiotic stress tolerance
    + OsCyp2 was able to complement the yeast mutant lacking native Cyp2 and also improved the growth of wild type yeast under above-mentioned stress conditions
    + Ectopic expression of OsCyp2-P imparted multiple abiotic stress tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants as evidenced by higher root length, shoot length, chlorophyll content, and K(+)/Na(+) ratio under stress conditions
    + Expression of a cyclophilin OsCyp2-P isolated from a salt-tolerant landrace of rice in tobacco alleviates stress via ion homeostasis and limiting ROS accumulation.
    + OsCyp2-P operates via reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and ion homeostasis and thus is a promising candidate gene for enhancing multiple abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants
    + The overall results suggest the explicit role of OsCyp2-P in bestowing multiple abiotic stress tolerance at the whole plant level
    + Publicly available massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and microarray data, besides our quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) data suggest that transcript abundance of OsCyp2-P is regulated under different stress conditions in a developmental and organ specific manner
    + Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development
    + To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lateral root formation, an auxin-responsive gene OsCYP2 (Os02g0121300) was characterized from rice
    + T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild-type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development
    + These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development
    + Yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down results confirmed that OsCYP2 interacted with a C2HC-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP, Os01g0252900) which is located in the rice nucleus
    + In rice, a tryptophan-proline (W-P) cis-trans switch in transcription repressor protein OsIAA11 along with its associated cyclophilin LRT2 are essential components in a negative feedback gene regulation circuit that controls lateral root initiation in response to the plant hormone auxin
    + Here we present NMR studies that determine and independently validate these parameters for LRT2 catalysis of the W-P motif in OsIAA11, providing predictive power for understanding the role of this switch in the auxin-responsive circuit and the resulting lateral rootless phenotype in rice
    + Binding of the transcription factor MYC2-like to the ABRE of the OsCYP2 promoter enhances salt tolerance in Oryza sativa.
