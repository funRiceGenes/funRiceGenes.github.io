* **Key message**  
    + OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.
    + Based on these results, we propose that OsCNGC13 acts as a novel maternal sporophytic factor required for stylar [Ca2+]cyt accumulation, ECM components modification and STT cell death, thus facilitating the penetration of pollen tube in the style for successful double fertilization and seed-setting in rice
    + We show that OsCNGC13 is permeable to Ca2+ Consistent with this, accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is defective in the sss1-D mutant style after pollination
