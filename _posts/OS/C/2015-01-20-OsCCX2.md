## Key message
1. __tolerance__, [A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca2+/cation transport in yeast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca2+/cation transport in yeast.%5BTitle%5D),  In contrast to AtCCXs, OsCCX2 expressing K667 yeast cells show tolerance towards excess Na+), Li+), Fe2+), Zn2+ and Co2+ and suggest its ability to transport both mono as well as divalent cations in yeast
