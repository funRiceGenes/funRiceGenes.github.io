## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Overexpression of OsC3H47 significantly enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses in rice seedlings, which indicates that OsC3H47 plays important roles in post-stress recovery |  However, overexpression of OsC3H47 reduced the ABA sensitivity of rice seedlings  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of OsC3H47 significantly enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses in rice seedlings, which indicates that OsC3H47 plays important roles in post-stress recovery |  However, overexpression of OsC3H47 reduced the ABA sensitivity of rice seedlings  
__RNAi__:
