* **Key message**  
    + OsCSN1 regulates the growth of rice seedlings through the GA signaling pathway in blue light.
    + The core structural domain of action that inhibits the growth of the aboveground part of rice seedlings is located at the N-terminal of OsCSN1
    + The mechanism of OsCSN1 and its N-terminal effects on rice seedling growth and development under blue light conditions were investigated
