* **Key message**  
    + The down-regulation of OsCV expression contributed to the maintenance of the chloroplast integrity under stress
    + Co-immunoprecipitation, intracellular co-localization, and bimolecular fluorescence demonstrated the in vivo interaction between OsCV and chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (OsGS2), affecting source-sink relationships of the plants under stress
    + Co-immunoprecipitation of OsCV-interacting proteins suggested that, similar to its role in chloroplast protein turnover, OsCV acted as a scaffold, binding peroxisomal proteins
