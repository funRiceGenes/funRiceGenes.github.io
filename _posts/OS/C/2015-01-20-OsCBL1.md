    + The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex
    + Here, we report that OsCBL1 also modulates nitrate signaling to regulate rice seedlings growth
    + The calcium sensor OsCBL1 modulates nitrate signaling to regulate seedling growth in rice.
    + Overall, our results showed a novel role for OsCBL1 in the regulation of nitrate signaling and nitrate-mediated rice growth
    + Here, we found that a protein OsCBL1 (Calcineurin B-like protein 1) is involved in the regulation of nitrogen and phosphorus signaling in rice
    + Compared with the wild type, knockdown of OsCBL1 inhibit the growth of rice to the same extent, when nitrogen is deficient or nitrogen is present in the form of ammonium-nitrate mixture
    + These results suggest that OsCBL1 may be involved in the response of rice to nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition in the environment, as well as the regulation of rice growth by environmental nutrition
    + OsCBL1 affects rice seedling growth by modulating nitrate and phosphate responses
