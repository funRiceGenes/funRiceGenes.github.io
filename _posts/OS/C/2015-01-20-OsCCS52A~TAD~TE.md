* **Key message**  
    + In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels
    + We conclude that besides having a conserved role in regulating cell cycle, APC/C(TE) has a unique function in regulating the plant-specific postembryonic shoot branching and tillering, which are major determinants of plant architecture and grain yield
    + In this study, rice cell cycle switch 52 A (OsCCS52A), an APC activator, is functionally characterized using the reverse genetic approach
    + In addition, overexpression of OsCCS52A inhibits mitotic cell division and induces endoreduplication and cell elongation in fission yeast
    + A cycle of endoreduplication is common in most of the differentiated cells of plant vegetative tissues and it occurs extensively in cereal endosperm cells
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm
    + A rice tiller is a specialized grain-bearing branch that contributes greatly to grain yield
    + We find that TE physically interacts with ABA receptor OsPYL/RCARs and promotes their degradation by the proteasome
    + Genetic analysis also shows OsPYL/RCARs act downstream of TE in mediating ABA responses
    + Conversely, ABA inhibits APC/C(TE) activity by phosphorylating TE through activating the SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK2s), which may interrupt the interaction between TE and OsPYL/RCARs and subsequently stabilize OsPYL/RCARs
