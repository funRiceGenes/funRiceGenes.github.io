## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [Three Distinct Rice Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Subunit Genes Required for Cellulose Synthesis in the Secondary Wall](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Three Distinct Rice Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Subunit Genes Required for Cellulose Synthesis in the Secondary Wall%5BTitle%5D),  We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA cellulose synthase catalytic subunit genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9
2. __cellulose__, [The rice dynamin-related protein DRP2B mediates membrane trafficking, and thereby plays a critical role in secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice dynamin-related protein DRP2B mediates membrane trafficking, and thereby plays a critical role in secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  BC3 mutation and overexpression altered the abundance of cellulose synthase catalytic subunit 4 OsCESA4 in the PM and in the endomembrane systems
