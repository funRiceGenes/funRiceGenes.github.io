* **Key message**  
    + Finally, overexpression of OsCYB5-2 increased OsHAK21-mediated K(+) transport and improved salt tolerance in rice seedlings
    + The association of OsCYB5-2 with the OsHAK21 transporter caused an increase in transporter activity by enhancing the apparent affinity for K(+)-binding but not Na(+)-binding
    + An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b 5 regulates high-affinity K + transport in response to salt stress in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCYB5-2__, __OsHAK21~qSE3__, [An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b 5 regulates high-affinity K+ transport in response to salt stress in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b 5 regulates high-affinity K+ transport in response to salt stress in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome b (5) (OsCYB5-2) that interacted with a high-affinity K(+) transporter (OsHAK21) at the plasma membrane
