* **Key message**  
    + OsCEN2 influenced grain size by restricting cell expansion in the spikelet hull and seed filling
    + Here, we report that the rice CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) family member OsCEN2 (also known as Rice TFL1/CEN homolog, RCN1), a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family protein, negatively controls grain size in rice
    + In in vivo and in vitro experiments, OsCEN2 physically interacted with a G-box factor 14-3-3 homolog, GF14f, which negatively regulates grain size
