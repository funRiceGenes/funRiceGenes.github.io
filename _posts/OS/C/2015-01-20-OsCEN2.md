* **Key message**  
    + OsCEN2 influenced grain size by restricting cell expansion in the spikelet hull and seed filling
    + Here, we report that the rice CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) family member OsCEN2 (also known as Rice TFL1/CEN homolog, RCN1), a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family protein, negatively controls grain size in rice
    + In in vivo and in vitro experiments, OsCEN2 physically interacted with a G-box factor 14-3-3 homolog, GF14f, which negatively regulates grain size
    + Here, we reported that the rice OsCEN2 gene can negatively regulate seed germination
    + The results of qRT-PCR showed that the OsCEN2 expression was increased in the early stage of seed germination
    + This study reveals that OsCEN2 regulates the germination speed by affecting the content of ABA during seed germination and provides a theoretical basis for research on rice direct seeding
