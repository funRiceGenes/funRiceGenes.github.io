* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
    + Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
    + Furthermore, Ca2+ and TFP, a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, were involved in the ABA-induced transcription of OsCML16 and its target genes, and they were also obviously induced by cold, drought, and salt stresses
    + Identification of novel OsCML16 target proteins and differential expression analysis under abiotic stresses in rice.
    + Taken together, our new findings have provided the basis for the novel signaling pathways of OsCML16 in the abiotic stress response in rice
