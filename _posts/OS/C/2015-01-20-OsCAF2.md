* **Key message**  
    + OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice
    + Phenotypic analysis showed that mutations to OsCAF2 led to albino leaves at the seeding stage that eventually caused plant death, and oscaf2 mutant plants had fewer chloroplasts and damaged chloroplast structure
    + Conclusion: Taken together, this study improved our understanding of the OsCAF2 protein, and revealed additional information about the molecular mechanism of OsCAF2 in regulating of chloroplast development in rice
    + However, the research of the OsCAF2 gene in rice is very little, and the effects of OsCAF2 genes on chloroplasts development are not well characterized

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsCRS2~CRS2__, [OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Through yeast two-hybrid experiments, we found that the C-terminal region of OsCAF2 interacted with OsCRS2 and formed an OsCAF2-OsCRS2 complex
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsPPR11__, [OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D), OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsPPR11__, [OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPPR11 is required for ndhA, and ycf3-1 introns splicing and interact with CRM family protein OsCAF2, suggesting that these two proteins may form splicing complexes to regulate group II introns splicing
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsPPR11__, [OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsPPR11 encoding P-type PPR protein that affects group II intron splicing and chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D),  Further analysis revealed that OsCAF2 interacts with OsPPR11 through the N-terminus
