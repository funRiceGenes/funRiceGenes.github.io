* **Key message**  
    + OsCER1 was highly expressed in the tapetum (stage 10) and bicellular pollen cells (stage 11)
    + Downregulation of OsCER1 in rice led to sterility, and fewer amyloplasts within the mature pollen grains
    + Furthermore, significantly altered levels of expression of genes involved in the pollen development were exhibited in the OsCER1 knocked down plants
    + These results indicate that OsCER1 is critical for VLC alkanes biosynthesis, plastids differentiation, and pollen development
    + OsCER1 Plays a Pivotal Role in Very-Long-Chain Alkane Biosynthesis and Affects Plastid Development and Programmed Cell Death of Tapetum in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + In addition, the downregulation of OsCER1 in rice caused delayed tapetal programmed cell death and abnormal development of plastids in the tapetal cells
    + OsGL1-4 is preferentially expressed in pollen and tapetal cells, and is required for the synthesis of very-long-chain alkanes
    + Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis suggested the humidity-sensitive male sterility of osgl1-4 was probably due to a significant reduction in C25 and C27 alkanes
    + OsCER1 regulates humidity-sensitive genic male sterility through very-long-chain (VLC) alkane metabolism of tryphine in rice
    + Phenotypic investigation of NPB and ltr1 suggested that ltr1 showed rumpled leaf with uneven distribution of bulliform cells and sclerenchyma cells, and disordered vascular bundles
    + A decrease in seed-setting rate in ltr1 led to decreased per-plant grain yield
    + Moreover, ltr1 was sensitive to salt stress, and LTR1 was strongly induced by salt stress
    + Moreover, overexpression of LTR1 enhanced yield in rice and LTR1 positively regulates salt stress by affecting water and ion homeostasis
    + Map-based cloning of LTR1 showed that there was a 2-bp deletion in the eighth exon of LOC_Os02g40784 in ltr1, resulting in a frameshift mutation and early termination of transcription
