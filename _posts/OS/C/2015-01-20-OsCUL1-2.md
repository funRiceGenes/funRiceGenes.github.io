* **Key message**  
    + However, its expression pattern in response to hormones and abiotic stresses was somehow different from those of the OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes
    + OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes were commonly upregulated in dry seeds and by ABA and salt/drought stresses, implying their involvement in ABA-mediated processes
