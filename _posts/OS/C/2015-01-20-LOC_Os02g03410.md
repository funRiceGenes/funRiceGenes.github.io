* **Key message**  
    + A significant number of genes involved in lipid metabolism and protection against oxidative stress appear to be up-regulated by OsCPK4 in roots of overexpressor plants
    + Taken together, our data show that OsCPK4 functions as a positive regulator of the salt and drought stress responses in rice via the protection of cellular membranes from stress-induced oxidative damage
    + Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no effect on the expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i
    + Overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress
    + Compared with control plants, OsCPK4 overexpressor plants exhibit stronger water-holding capability and reduced levels of membrane lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage under drought or salt stress conditions
    + Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK4 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK4 in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells
    + Here, we report that OsCPK4 expression is induced by high salinity, drought, and the phytohormone abscisic acid
    + Also, salt-treated OsCPK4 seedlings accumulate less Na(+) in their roots
    + Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice.
    + It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration
    + Altogether, our findings indicate that OsCPK4 is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also blast disease resistance of rice crops
    + Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways
    + OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield
    + In this work, the isoform OsCPK4 of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection
    + The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression
    + The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth and development in rice
    + In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) were significantly enhanced in the oscpk4 mutants
    + These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice
    + However, little is known on molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity
    + These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses; whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery and thus enhancing plant immunity
    + The kinase OsCPK4 regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.
    + OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176
    + Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176
