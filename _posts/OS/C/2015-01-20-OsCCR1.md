* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsCCR1  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os02g56460](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g56460)  
    + RAPdb: [Os02g0808800](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os02g0808800)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis, is an effector of small GTPase Rac in defense signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis, is an effector of small GTPase Rac in defense signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2006, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AK064401](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK064401)

* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsCCR1 was induced by a sphingolipid elicitor, suggesting that OsCCR1 participates in defense signaling
    + Thus, it is likely that OsRac1 controls lignin synthesis through regulation of both NADPH oxidase and OsCCR1 activities during defense responses in rice
