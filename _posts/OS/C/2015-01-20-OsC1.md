* **Key message**  
    + These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance
    + The OsC1 transcriptional regulator helps to ameliorate oxidative stresses in plants owing to its anthocyanin modulating ability
    + The positive correlation between the expression of ABP genes and OsC1 along with the nuclear localization of OsC1 are in line with its possible involvement as a transcriptional regulator of ABP genes
