* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, exogenous ABA application up-regulates OsCam1-1 (the salt-stress-responsive calmodulin) gene expression, and calmodulin was shown to play a role in the signal transduction cascade in proline accumulation during salt stress
    + Overexpression of OsCaM1-1 induced the expression of Ca(2+) /HS-related AtCBK3, AtPP7, AtHSF and AtHSP at a non-inducing temperature and enhanced intrinsic thermotolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis
    + Under salt stress, the photosynthesis rate in the transgenic rice was slightly lower than in wild type, while sucrose and starch contents were higher, suggesting that energy and carbon metabolism were affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression
    + A previous study has revealed that transgenic rice over-expressing the calmodulin gene OsCam1-1 (LOC_Os03g20370) is more tolerant to salt stress than wild type
    + To elucidate the role of OsCam1-1 in the salt stress response mechanism, downstream components of the OsCam1-1-mediated response were identified and investigated by transcriptome profiling and target identification
    + Transcriptome profiling of transgenic 'Khao Dawk Mali 105' rice over-expressing OsCam1-1 and wild type rice showed that overexpression of OsCam1-1 widely affected the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes under salt stress, including signaling, hormone-mediated regulation, transcription, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glyoxylate cycle

    + __GSE5__, __OsCam1-1__, [Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains (IQD), which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1
    + __GW5L__, __OsCam1-1__, [GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We also show that GW5L could confer salt stress resistance through an association with calmodulin protein OsCaM1-1
    + __OsCam1-1__, __OsCam1-2~OsCam1__, [Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification.%5BTitle%5D),  GO terms enriched in their associated proteins that matched those of the differentially expressed genes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression revealed various downstream cellular processes that could potentially be regulated by OsCaM1 through their actions
