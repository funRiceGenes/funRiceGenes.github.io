    + The rice thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 confers enhanced environmental stress tolerance in tobacco and Arabidopsis
    + A cypclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a variant interacts with SLR1 and OsFSD2 in nucleus and chloroplast respectively to integrate chilling tolerance and cell elongation
    + Cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 with a novel variant integrates defense and cell elongation for chilling response in rice.
    + Here, we reported a cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 was shown to function in stress response and cell elongation
    + The loss-of function OsCYP20-2 mutant showed sensitive to chilling stress with accumulation extra ROS during chilling stress
    + In chloroplast, the full-length OsCYP20-2 promotes OsFSD2 forming homodimer and enhances its activity, which eliminates the accumulation of ROS under chilling stress
    + In nucleus, OsCYP20-2 made conformation change of SLR1 to promote its degradation for cell elongation
