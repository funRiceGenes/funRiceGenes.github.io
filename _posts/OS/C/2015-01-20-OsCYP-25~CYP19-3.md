* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report on the identification of a new cyclophilin gene OsCYP-25 (LOC_Os09 g39780) from rice which found to be upregulated in response to various abiotic stresses viz
    + These findings suggest that OsCYP-25 might perform an important function in mediating wide range of cellular response under multiple abiotic stresses
    + Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses
    + The in silico analysis showed that OsCYP-25 interacts with different proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, ribosome biogenesis, RNA metabolism, RNA editing, gene expression, signal transduction or stress response
