* **Key message**  
    + The OsCSD3 transcript was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought and oxidative stress
    + Unlike several other known CuZn SODs, OsCSD3 showed higher tolerance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and thermal inactivation
    + Heterologous over-expression of OsCSD3 enhanced tolerance of E
