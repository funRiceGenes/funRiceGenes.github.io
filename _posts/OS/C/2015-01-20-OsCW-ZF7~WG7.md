* **Key message**  
    + Knockout of OsCW-ZF7 caused defective development of awns
    + Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7
    + The grain size of WG7 knockout mutants and WG7 overexpression lines indicated that WG7 is a positive regulator of grain size
    + EMSAs and ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that WG7 directly bound to the promoter of OsMADS1, a grain size gene, and thereby significantly activated its expression
    + These findings demonstrated that WG7 upregulated OsMADS1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, enhanced histone H3K4me3<U+00A0>enrichment in the promoter and ultimately increased grain width
    + WG7 underwent directional selection due to the poor fertility of the nonfunctional mutant
    + WG7 encodes a cysteine-tryptophan (CW) domain-containing transcriptional activator
