* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress
    + Functional characterisation of OsCPK21, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that confers salt tolerance in rice
    + The survival rate of the OsCPK21-FOX plants was higher than that of wild-type (WT) plants grown under high salinity conditions
    + Several ABA- and high salinity-inducible genes were more highly expressed in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants
    + The inhibition of seedling growth by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was greater in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants
    + These results suggest that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e to facilitate the response to ABA and salt stress
    + We used an in<U+00A0>vitro kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis to verify that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e at Tyr-138
    + Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed that the transcription of OsCPK21 is coordinated with that of MIKC*-type MADS box transcription factors OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68 during rice anther development
    + OsCPK21 is required for pollen late-stage development in rice.
    + Here, we found that the knockdown of spikelet-specific OsCPK21 causes pollen abortion in OsCPK21-RNAi transgenic plants
