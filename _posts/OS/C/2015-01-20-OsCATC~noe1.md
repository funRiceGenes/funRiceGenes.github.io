* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, noe1 resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves, which consequently promoted NO production via the activation of nitrate reductase
    + Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death
    + The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death
    + Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants
    + Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1
    + NO targets identified only in noe1 plants included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin, which have been reported to be involved in S-nitrosylation-regulated cell death in animals
