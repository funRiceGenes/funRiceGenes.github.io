* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 (OsCSLD1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs
    + Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation
    + Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells
    + Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that OsCSLD1 may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins
    + OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice
    + In situ hybridization showed that OsCSLD1 was expressed not only in root hairs but also in epidermal and cortex cell walls except for stele
    + qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsCSLD1 was expressed not only in root but also in shoot
    + Root hairless 2 (rth2) mutant represents a loss-of-function allele of the cellulose synthase-like gene OsCSLD1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Positional cloning and complementation test revealed that the causal gene of rth2 was Cellulose Synthase-Like D1 (OsCSLD1)
    + Furthermore, OsCSLD1 is the only member of the four rice CSLD genes that shows root-specific expression
    + OsCSLD1 Mediates NH(4)(+)-Dependent Root Hair Growth Suppression and AMT1;2 Expression in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
