## Key message
1. __root hair__, [OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 OsCSLD1 gene is required for root hair development, as rice Oryza sativa mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs
2. __root hair__, [OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation
3. __root hair__, [OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells
