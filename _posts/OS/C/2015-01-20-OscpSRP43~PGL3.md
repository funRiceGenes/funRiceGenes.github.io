* **Key message**  
    + OscpSRP43 was constitutively expressed in various organs with the highest level in the leaf
    + PGL3 is required for chlorophyll synthesis and impacts leaf senescence in rice
    + pgl3 is a rice leaf color mutant derived from Xiushui11 (Oryza sativa L
    + Map-based cloning of PGL3 revealed  that it encodes the chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 kDa protein (cpSRP43)
    + Considerable reactive oxygen species were accumulated in the leaves of pgl3, and the transcription levels of its scavenging genes were down-regulated, indicating that pgl3 can accelerate senescence
    + In addition, high temperatures could inhibit the plant's growth and facilitate the process of senescence in pgl3
