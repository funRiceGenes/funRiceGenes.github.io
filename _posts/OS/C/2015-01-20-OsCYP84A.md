* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Rice transformants in which OsCYP84A expression was suppressed by the antisense gene showed apparent growth retardation with obvious symptoms of damage on the plant bodies under UV-B irradiation, although no phenotypic alteration occurred under normal growth conditions
