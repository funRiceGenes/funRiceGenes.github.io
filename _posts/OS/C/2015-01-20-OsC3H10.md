* **Key message**  
    + OsC3H10 is predominantly expressed in seeds, and its expression levels rapidly declined during seed imbibition
    + Root-specific overexpression of OsC3H10 was insufficient to induce drought tolerance, while the overexpression of OsC3H10 throughout the entire plant enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants
    + Our results demonstrated that OsC3H10 is involved in the regulation of the drought tolerance pathway by modulating the expression of stress-related genes
    + The expression of OsC3H10 was induced by drought, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA)
    + Subcellular localization analysis revealed that OsC3H10 localized not only in the nucleus but also to the processing bodies and stress granules upon stress treatment
    + Transcriptome analysis revealed that OsC3H10 overexpression elevated the expression levels of genes involved in stress responses, including LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEINs (LEAs), PATHOGENESIS RELATED GENEs (PRs) and GERMIN-LIKE PROTEINs (GLPs)
