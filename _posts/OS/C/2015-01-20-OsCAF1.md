* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The mesophyll cells in oscaf1 mutant had decreased chloroplast numbers and damaged chloroplast structures
    + OsCAF1 regulates chloroplast development by influencing the splicing of group II introns
    + In the study, we generated oscaf1 albino mutants, which eventually died at the seedling stage, through the editing of OsCAF1 with two CRM domains using CRISPR/Cas9 technology
