* **Key message**  
    + The OsCpn60β1 mutant displayed a striking albino leaf phenotype and was seedling lethal
    + OsCpn60β1 is Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + In addition, OsCpn60β1 was located in the chloroplast and OsCpn60β1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues particularly in the green tissues
    + These results indicate that OsCpn60β1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice
