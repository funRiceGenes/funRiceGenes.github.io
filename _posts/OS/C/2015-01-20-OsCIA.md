1. __growth__, [Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers%5BTitle%5D),  The OsCIA protein was detected in panicles, leaves, and seedling tissues under normal growth conditions
2. __temperature__, [Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers%5BTitle%5D),  Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of OsCIA mRNA expression showed no significant change between low temperature-treated and untreated plants
3. __panicle__, [Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers%5BTitle%5D),  The OsCIA protein was detected in panicles, leaves, and seedling tissues under normal growth conditions
4. __seedling__, [Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers%5BTitle%5D),  The OsCIA protein was detected in panicles, leaves, and seedling tissues under normal growth conditions
5. __anther__, [Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers%5BTitle%5D),  The newly induced protein named Oryza sativa cold-induced anther protein OsCIA was identified as an unknown protein
