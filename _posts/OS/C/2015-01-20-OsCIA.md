* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The OsCIA protein was detected in panicles, leaves, and seedling tissues under normal growth conditions
    + Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of OsCIA mRNA expression showed no significant change between low temperature-treated and untreated plants
    + The newly induced protein named Oryza sativa cold-induced anther protein (OsCIA) was identified as an unknown protein
