* **Key message**  
    + By differential screening of the library, we have isolated cDNAs of two genes, designated as Osc4 and Osc6, that are abundantly expressed in anthers containing tetrads and uninucleate microspores, but are not expressed in leaves or roots
    + In situ localization of mRNA was carried out on two cDNAs (Osc4 and Osc6) that had been isolated from rice anthers at the microspore stage
    + Expression of Osc4 is absent in mature anthers, while Osc6 is present although the expression decays during pollen maturation
