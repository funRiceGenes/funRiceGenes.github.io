* **Key message**  
    + OsCYP71D8L as a key regulator involved in growth and stress response by mediating gibberellins homeostasis in rice.
    + Thus, our results suggest that OsCYP71D8L plays important roles in regulating rice growth and stress responses by coordinating GAs and CKs homeostasis, and it is useful to engineer stress-tolerant rice
    + We found that its gain-of-function mutant (cyp71d8l) and transgenic plants overexpressing OsCYP71D8L (OsCYP71D8L-OE) displayed similar phenotypes including dwarfed plant, reduced panicle length and grain number per panicle, and their endogenous GAs levels were notably decreased as compared to wild type (WT), respectively
