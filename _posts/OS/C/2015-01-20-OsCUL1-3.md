* **Key message**  
    + Expression of the OsCUL1-3 gene was also induced in dry seeds and by ABA-related salt and drought stresses, implying their participation in ABA responses

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCUL1-3__, __OsMBTB32__, [OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We further found that OsCUL1 proteins, particularly OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3, interact with OsMBTB32 and may suppress the function of OsMBTB32 during salt stress
    + __OsCUL1-3__, __OsMBTB32__, [OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, OsWRKY42, a homolog of ZmWRKY114 which negatively regulates salt stress in rice, directly binds to the W-box of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 promoters to promote the interaction of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 with OsMBTB32 protein in rice
    + __OsCUL1-3__, __OsMBTB32__, [OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMBTB32, a MATH-BTB domain-containing protein that interacts with OsCUL1s to regulate salt tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The overexpression of OsMBTB32 and OsCUL1-3 further confirmed the function of OsMBTB32 and OsCUL1s in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis
