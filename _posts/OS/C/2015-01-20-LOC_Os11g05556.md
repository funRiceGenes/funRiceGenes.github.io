* **Key message**  
    + Knockout lines of OscpSRP54b (LOC_Os11g05556) exhibited similar pale green phenotype to pgl14 with reduced chlorophyll contents and impaired chloroplast development, but showed apparently arrested-growth and died within 3 weeks
    + Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
    + OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway
    + Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage

* **Connection**  
    + __OscpSRP43~PGL3__, __OscpSRP54b__, [Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were able to interact with OscpSRP43, respectively
    + __OscpSRP43~PGL3__, __OscpSRP54b__, [Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  The transcript level of OscpSRP43 was significantly reduced while the transcript level of OscpSRP54b was apparently increased in pgl14
    + __OscpSRP43~PGL3__, __OscpSRP54b__, [Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice%5BTitle%5D),  In contrast, the transcript levels of OscpSRP54a, OscpSRP43 and OscpSRP54b were all significantly decreased in OscpSRP54b knockout lines
    + __OscpSRP43~PGL3__, __OscpSRP54b__, [Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Chloroplast SRP54s are Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice%5BTitle%5D),   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
