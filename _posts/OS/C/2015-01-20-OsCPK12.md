    + Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance
    + A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance
    + We investigated the effects of overexpression and disruption of an Oryza sativa (rice) CDPK (OsCPK12) on the plant's response to abiotic and biotic stresses
    + Eight genes, OsCPK2, OsCPK11, OsCPK14, OsCPK22, OsCPK25, OsCPK26, OsCPK27 and OsCPK29 were found dominantly expressed in the panicle and the stamen, and five genes, OsCPK6, OsCPK7, OsCPK12, OsCPK23 and OsCPK31 were up-regulated in the endosperm stage
    + We also observed that OsCPK12-OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of OsCPK12 in the ABA signaling pathway
    + Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, oscpk12, and plants transformed with an OsCPK12 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants
    + OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress
    + These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS
    + We found that overexpression of OsCPK12 FL-cDNA, encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase ( CDPK), conferred tolerance to low-nitrogen stress in rice
    + After two weeks of low-nitrogen treatment, dry weights of shoots from OsCPK12-overexpressing plants were greater than those from control plants
    + Furthermore, total nitrogen contents of OsCPK12-overexpressing plants were higher than those of the control plants
    + Our findings suggest that OsCPK12 is involved in the signal transduction pathway(s) in the low-nitrogen stress response and may be useful in engineering crop plants with improved tolerance to low nitrogen levels
    + Our results demonstrate that the mutant of OsCPK12 triggers the premature leaf senescence; however, the overexpression of OsCPK12 may delay its growth period and provide the potentially positive effect on productivity in rice
    + We used CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted disruption of OsCPK12 in ZH8015 and all the mutants exhibited the premature senescence
    + Sequencing analysis in target interval indicated there was an eight bases deletion mutation in OsCPK12 which encoded a calcium-dependent protein kinase
