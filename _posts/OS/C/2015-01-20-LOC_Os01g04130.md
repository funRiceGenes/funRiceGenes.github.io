* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified a rice pale green leaf mutant, crs2
    + CRS2 encodes a chloroplast RNA splicing 2 protein localized in the chloroplast
    + In summary, the G229R mutation in CRS2 causes chloroplast protein abnormalities and affects photosystem performance in rice; the above findings facilitate the elucidation of the physiological mechanism of chloroplast proteins affecting photosynthesis
    + The crs2 mutant showed different degrees of low chlorophyll phenotypes at different growth stages, especially at the seedling stage

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCAF2__, __OsCRS2~CRS2__, [OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCAF2 contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Through yeast two-hybrid experiments, we found that the C-terminal region of OsCAF2 interacted with OsCRS2 and formed an OsCAF2-OsCRS2 complex
