    + __Ehd1__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%5BTitle%5D), SDG711 was also found to be involved in the repression of Ehd1 in LD.
    + __Ehd1__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%5BTitle%5D), SDG711 was shown to directly target to OsLF and Ehd1 loci to mediate H3K27me3 and gene repression.
