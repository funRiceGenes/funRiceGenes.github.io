    + NA
    + The expression of SDG711 and SDG718 is induced by LD and SD, respectively.
    + OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF
    + Reduced cell expansion and cell division of stem caused significant reduction of stem length during mature period of OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants
    + To determine how PcG genes regulate plant height, we investigated the phenotypes of the emf2b mutant and OsEMF2b, OsFIE2 and OsCLF RNAi transgenic plants; they all exhibited dwarf phenotype
    + Therefore, we speculated that these PcG genes, OsFIE2, OsCLF and OsEMF2b, may work as a PRC2 to regulate rice height
