6. __Ehd1__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%5BTitle%5D), SDG711 was also found to be involved in the repression of Ehd1 in LD.
7. __Ehd1__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%5BTitle%5D), SDG711 was shown to directly target to OsLF and Ehd1 loci to mediate H3K27me3 and gene repression.

9. __JMJ703__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.%5BTitle%5D),  Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size
10. __JMJ703__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM
