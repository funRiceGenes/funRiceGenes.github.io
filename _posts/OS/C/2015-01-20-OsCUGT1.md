* **Key message**  
    + RNA sequencing revealed that multiple biological processes associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cytokinin metabolism and pollen development are affected in the oscugt1 mutant
    + Overall, these results suggest that rice OsCUGT1 plays an essential role in rice development
    + Histological pollen analysis suggests that the spikelet sterility in oscugt1 mutants may be caused by abnormal microsporogenesis
    + Moreover, multiple transgenic plants with knockdown of OsCUGT1 expression through RNA interference were obtained, which also showed obvious defects in plant height and fertility
    + OsCUGT1 was knocked out by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system to obtain the mutant oscugt1, which showed a severe dwarf and sterility phenotype
