* **Key message**  
    + To understand the molecular mechanisms of crown root formation, we isolated a rice mutant defective in crown root emergence designated as Oscand1 (named after the Arabidopsis homologous gene AtCAND1)
    + The defect of visible crown root in the Oscand1 mutant is the result of cessation of the G2/M cell cycle transition in the crown root meristem
    + During crown root primordium development, the expression of OsCAND1 is confined to the root cap after the establishment of fundamental organization
    + Exogenous auxin application can partially rescue the defect of crown root development in Oscand1
    + Taken together, these data show that OsCAND1 is involved in auxin signaling to maintain the G2/M cell cycle transition in crown root meristem and, consequently, the emergence of crown root
    + OsCAND1 is required for crown root emergence in rice
