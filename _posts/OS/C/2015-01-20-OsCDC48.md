* **Key message**  
    + OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle
    + Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.
    + Our results indicated that the impaired function of OsCDC48 was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype
    + Overexpression of OsCDC48-psd128 resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased plant tiller numbers while overexpression of OsCDC48 also resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, but increased plant tiller numbers and grain yield, indicating its potential utilization for yield improvement
    + We demonstrate that the C-terminus of OsCDC48 is essential for maintaining its full ATPase activity and OsCDC48/48E interaction is required to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice
    + Our results demonstrated that the C-terminal region of OsCDC48 was essential for maintaining the full ATPase activity and OsCDC48/48E complex might function in form of heteromultimers to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice
    + Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCDC48__, __OsDER1__, [OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.%5BTitle%5D),  Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway
