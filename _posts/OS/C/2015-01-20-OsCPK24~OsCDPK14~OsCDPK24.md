* **Key message**  
    + While OsCPK24 knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to cold compared to wild type, OsCPK24-overexpressing plants exhibited increased cold tolerance
    + Together, our results suggest that OsCPK24 functions as a positive regulator of cold stress tolerance in rice, a process mediated by calcium signaling and involving phosphorylation and the inhibition of OsGrx10 to sustain higher glutathione levels
    + The calcium-dependent kinase OsCPK24 functions in cold stress responses in rice.
    + Plants overexpressing OsCPK24 exhibited increased accumulation of proline (an osmoprotectant) and glutathione (an antioxidant) and maintained a higher GSH/GSSG (reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione) ratio during cold stress compared to wild type
    + In addition to these effects in responses to cold stress, we found that the kinase activity of OsCPK24 varied under different calcium concentrations
    + Further, OsCPK24 phosphorylated OsGrx10, a glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, at rates modulated by changes in calcium concentration
    + Conclusions: OsANN4 plays a crucial role in the ABA response, partially by modulating ROS production, mediating Ca2+ influx or interacting with OsCDPK24
    + This study revealed the molecular mechanism of ET-induced resistance to Xoo in rice via OsCPK24, which provided a basis for the development of new bactericides based on the OsCPK24 protein
    + In addition, the biological function of OsCPK24 as a mediator for rice resistance to Xoo was determined through the anti-Xoo phenotypic test of OsCPK24 transgenic rice and the affinity analysis of the OsCPK24 recombinant protein in vitro and ET
