* **Key message**  
    + Among three CAld5H genes identified in rice, OsCAld5H1 (CYP84A5) appeared to be predominantly expressed in lignin-producing rice vegetative tissues
    + Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls
    + In the present study, to further investigate the effect of suppression of OsCAld5H1 on rice lignin structure, we generated loss-of-function mutants of OsCAld5H1 using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system
