* **Key message**  
    + Noticeably, OsCaML2 (LOC_Os03g59770) was experimentally confirmed as a target gene of osa-miR1432, and the overexpressing OsCaML2 transgenic plants exhibited compromised resistance to Xoo infestation
    + Our results indicate that osa-miR1432 and OsCaML2 were differently responsive to Xoo invasion at the transcriptional level and fine-tune rice resistance to Xoo infection, which may be referable in resistance gene discovery and valuable in the pursuit of improving Xoo resistance in rice breeding
