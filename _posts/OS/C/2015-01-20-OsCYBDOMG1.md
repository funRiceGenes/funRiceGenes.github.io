* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, plant growth and grain yield of rss5 and the OsCYBDOMG1 knockout mutant (cr-1) were significantly decreased compared to wild-type plants under normal conditions
    + OsCYBDOMG1 positively regulates salt tolerance, plant growth, and grain yield by affecting ascorbate biosynthesis and redox state
    + The elite haplotype of OsCYBDOMG1 associated with higher salt tolerance and grain width and weight was mainly existed in japonica varieties
    + These results suggest that OsCYBDOMG1 plays an important role in the regulation of salt tolerance, plant growth, and grain yield in rice
    + Mutations of OsCYBDOMG1 resulted in decreased ascorbic acid (AsA) content and AsA/DHA (dehydroascorbate) ratio, which led to increased H(2)O(2) accumulation and reduced salt tolerance
    + The OsCYBDOMG1 gene was mainly expressed in young shoots and nodes, and the encoded protein was principally located in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum
