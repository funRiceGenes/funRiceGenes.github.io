* **Key message**  
    + We previously described a rice mutant, srt5, which exhibits extremely stunted post-embryonic root growth that is rescuable by metabolizable sugars
    + Sucrose levels in srt5 root cells were elevated, consistent with a crucial role for SRT5 in cytosolic sucrose cleavage at early root developmental stages
    + These results suggest that SRT5 is the key isoform of Inv-Ns required for carbon and energy supply during early root development
    + Exogenously supplying glucose could rescue the root growth defects of the Oscyt-inv1 mutant
    + These results indicated that OsCyt-inv1 played important roles in root cell development and reproductivity in rice
    + OsCYT-INV1 for alkaline/neutral invertase is involved in root cell development and reproductivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
