## Key message
1. __growth__, [Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family%5BTitle%5D),  We previously described a rice mutant, srt5, which exhibits extremely stunted post-embryonic root growth that is rescuable by metabolizable sugars
2. __root development__, [Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family%5BTitle%5D),  Sucrose levels in srt5 root cells were elevated, consistent with a crucial role for SRT5 in cytosolic sucrose cleavage at early root developmental stages
3. __root development__, [Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Analysis of the rice SHORT-ROOT5 gene revealed functional diversification of plant neutral/alkaline invertase family%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that SRT5 is the key isoform of Inv-Ns required for carbon and energy supply during early root development
