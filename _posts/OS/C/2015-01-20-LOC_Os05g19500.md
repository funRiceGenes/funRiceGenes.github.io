* **Key message**  
    + OsCHX14 is involved in the K+ homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa) flowers
    + Our data suggest that OsCHX14 may play an important role in K+ homeostasis during flowering in rice
    + Expression profiling confirmed that among 17 CHX genes in rice, OsCHX14 was the only member that showed an expression polymorphism, not only in osjar1 mutants but also in RNAi lines of OsCOI1, another key member of the JA signaling pathway
