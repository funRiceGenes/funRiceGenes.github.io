* **Key message**  
    + SCF OsFBK1 E3 ligase mediates jasmonic acid induced turn-over of OsATL53 and OsCCR14 to regulate rice anther and root lignification.
    + SCF OsFBK1 mediates turn-over of OsATL53 in cytoplasm and nucleus, while of OsCCR14 in the nucleus as validated by cell-free degradation assays
    + Currently, we have identified OsATL53, a member of ATL family of RING-H2 proteins interacting with OsCCR14 in cytoplasm
    + Biochemically, OsATL53 decreases enzymatic activity of OsCCR14 and sequesters it in the cytoplasm thereby regulating the lignification process
    + Knock-down rice transgenics of OsATL53 display increased lignin deposition in the anthers and roots vis-a-vis wild-type, while those of OsCCR14 have decreased lignin content
