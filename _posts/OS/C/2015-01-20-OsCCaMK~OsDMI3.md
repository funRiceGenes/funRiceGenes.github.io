10. __nitrogen__, [A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report the effect of a Tos17-induced OsCCaMK mutant NE1115 on CH4 flux in low-nitrogen LN and standard-nitrogen SN paddy fields compared with wild-type WT Nipponbare
