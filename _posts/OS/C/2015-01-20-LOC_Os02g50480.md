* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic expression of OsHk6 in rice calli promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot induction, further supporting an OsHk6 in planta function as a cytokinin receptor
    + OsHk4 and OsHk6 were highly expressed in spikelets, suggesting that tZ and iP might play key roles in grain development
    + OsHk6 was highly sensitive to isopentenyladenine (iP) and was capable of restoring cytokinin-dependent ARR6 reporter expression in the ahk2 ahk3 Arabidopsis mutant upon treatment with 1 nM iP
    + Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP
    + Our results demonstrate that OsCKT1 plays important roles in cytokinin perception and control of root development in rice
    + In addition, whole-genome gene expression profiling analysis showed that OsCKT1 was involved in cytokinin regulation of a number of biological processes, including secondary metabolism, sucrose and starch metabolism, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis
