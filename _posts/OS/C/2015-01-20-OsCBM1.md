* **Key message**  
    + OsCBM1 physically interacts with OsRbohA, a NADPH oxidase, and the expression of OsCBM1 in osrbohA, an OsRbohA-knockout mutant, is significantly downregulated under both normal growth and drought stress conditions
    + Overexpression of OsCBM1 increased drought tolerance and reactive oxygen species production in rice, whereas the knockdown of the gene decreased them
    + All these results suggest that OsCBM1 participates in NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production by interacting with OsRbohA and OsRacGEF1, contributing to drought stress tolerance of rice
    + OsCBM1 is localized in both the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane
