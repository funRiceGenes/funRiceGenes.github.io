## Key message
1. __flowering time__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD-promotion pathway
2. __flower__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that a novel COL gene, OsCO3, containing a single B-box and a CCT domain, modulates photoperiodic flowering in rice
3. __flower__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsCO3 specifically caused late flowering under short day (SD) conditions relative to wild-type rice plants
4. __flower__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD-promotion pathway
5. __flower__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice

## Connection
1. __Hd1__, __OsCO3__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The circadian expression pattern of OsCO3 mRNA oscillated in a different phase from Hd1 and was similar to that of OsCO3 pre-mRNA, suggesting that the diurnal expression pattern of OsCO3 transcripts may be regulated at the transcriptional level
2. __Hd3a__, __OsCO3__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD-promotion pathway
