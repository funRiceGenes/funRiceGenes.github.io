* **Key message**  
    + Genetic complementation indicated that OsCNX6 not only rescued the PHS and seedling lethal phenotype of cnx6 mutant, but also recovered the MoCo-dependent enzyme activities such as xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase (AO), nitrate reductase (NR), and sulfite oxidase (SO)
    + Expression pattern showed that OsCNX6 was richly expressed in seed during embryo maturation by qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization
    + Collectively, these data described that OsCNX6 participated in MoCo biosynthesis, and is essential for rice development, especially for seed dormancy and germination, and OsCNX6 could be an effective target for improving abiotic stress tolerance in rice
    + Map-based cloning showed that OsCNX6 and OsCNX1 encoding homologs of MoaE and MoeA were responsible for F254 and F5-1 mutants, respectively
    + Furthermore, the OsCNX6 overexpression plants can significantly enhance the MoCo-dependent enzyme activities, and improved the osmotic and salt stress tolerance without unfavorable phenotypes
