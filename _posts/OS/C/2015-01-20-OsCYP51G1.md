* **Publication**  
    + [Obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

* **Key message**  
    + However, knockdown of OsCYP51G1 by RNAi did not elicit these BR deficiency-related phenotypes, such as dwarfism, erect leaves and small seeds, nor was the leaf lamina angle sensitive to brassinolide treatment
    + Obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase OsCYP51G1 is involved in phytosterol synthesis and affects pollen and seed development
    + Knockdown and knockout of OsCYP51G1 resulted in delayed flowering, impaired membrane integrity, abnormal pollen, and reduced grain yield, whereas OsCYP51G1 overexpression led to increased grain yield
