* **Key message**  
    + A putative zeatin O-glucosyltransferase OscZOG1 regulates root and shoot development and formation of agronomic traits in rice.
    + We found that OscZOG1 was preferentially expressed in shoot and root meristematic tissues and nascent organs
    + In shoots, knockdown of OscZOG1 expression by RNA interference significantly improved tillering, panicle branching, grain number per panicle and seed size, which are important agronomic traits for grain yield
    + In this study, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of improving the critical yield-determinant agronomic traits, including tiller number, panicle branches, total grain number per panicle and grain weight by down-regulating the expression level of OscZOG1
