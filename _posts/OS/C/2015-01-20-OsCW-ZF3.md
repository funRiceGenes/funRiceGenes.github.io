    + __OsCW-ZF3__, __OsCW-ZF7~WG7__, [Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7
