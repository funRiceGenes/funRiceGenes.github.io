* **Key message**  
    + Surprisingly, a large amount of truncated proteins derived from OsCMO was induced in the rice seedlings in response to salt stresses
    + Northern blot demonstrated the transcription of OsCMO is enhanced by salt stress
    + Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCMO results in increased GB content and elevated tolerance to salt stress
    + KEY MESSAGE: Expression and transgenic studies demonstrate OsCMO is transcriptionally induced in response to salt stress and functions in increasing glycinebetaine accumulation and enhancing tolerance to salt stress
    + However, the intracellular GB level and the tolerance to salt stress of the transgenic lines overexpressing OsCMO were significantly enhanced
