* **Key message**  
    + OsCHI3 and the other OsCHIs were expressed constitutively throughout the rice growth period and different tissues
    + OsCHI3 expression was induced immediately in response to ultra-violet (UV) stress, suggesting its involvement in the biosynthesis of sakuranetin, a flavonoid phytoalexin in rice
