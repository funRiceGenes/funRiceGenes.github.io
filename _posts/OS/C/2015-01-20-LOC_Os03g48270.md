* **Key message**  
    + A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK9 positively regulates drought stress tolerance and spikelet fertility.
    + The results of OsCPK9 overexpression (OsCPK9-OX) and OsCPK9 RNA interference (OsCPK9-RNAi) analyses revealed that OsCPK9 plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance and spikelet fertility
    + Our results demonstrated that OsCPK9 is a positive regulator of abiotic stress tolerance, spikelet fertility, and ABA sensitivity
    + Physiological analyses revealed that OsCPK9 improves drought stress tolerance by enhancing stomatal closure and by improving the osmotic adjustment ability of the plant
    + OsCPK9 transcription was induced by abscisic acid (ABA), PEG6000, and NaCl treatments
