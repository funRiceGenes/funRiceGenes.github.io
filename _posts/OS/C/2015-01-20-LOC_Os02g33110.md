* **Key message**  
    + During the course of grain filling in the caryopses, OsCIN1 transcript is detectable only in the very early stage of their development, 1~4 d after flowering, when the cell wall invertase activity is the highest and the increase in caryopsis length is rapid

    + OsCIN1 is expressed in roots, in sink- and source-leaves, and in panicles
    + Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region
