* **Key message**  
    + Heterogeneous overexpression of OsCTR1 in Arabidopsis exhibited hypersensitive phenotypes with respect to ABA-responsive seed germination, seedling growth and stomatal closure
    + OsCTR1 was highly expressed in response to dehydration treatment and defense-related phytohormones, and its encoded protein was localized in both the chloroplasts and the cytosol
    + Several interacting partners were identified, which were mainly targeted to the chloroplasts, and interactions with OsCTR1 were confirmed by using biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)
    + Interestingly, two chloroplast-localized proteins (OsCP12 and OsRP1) interacted with OsCTR1 in the cytosol, and ubiquitination by OsCTR1 led to protein degradation via the Ub 26S proteasome
    + The rice RING E3 ligase, OsCTR1, inhibits trafficking to the chloroplasts of OsCP12 and OsRP1, and its overexpression confers drought tolerance in Arabidopsis
    + Here, we found that a rice gene, OsCTR1, encoding the RING Ub E3 ligase plays an important role in drought tolerance
