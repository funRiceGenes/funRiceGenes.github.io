* **Key message**  
    + Collectively, our results indicate that rice OsCPK10 is a crucial regulator in plant immune responses, and that it may regulate disease resistance by activating both SA- and JA-dependent defense responses
    + Similarly, transgenic rice plants containing constitutively active OsCPK10 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast fungus M
    + Calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK10 mediates both drought tolerance and blast disease resistance in rice plants.
    + This work reports that the OsCPK10 isoform positively mediates tolerance to different stresses in rice plants by enhancing their antioxidant capacity and protecting them from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, with the uncontrolled generation of ROS being a common feature of these stresses
    + OsCPK10 therefore appears to be a good molecular target to improve tolerance to abiotic stresses as well as to blast disease, which limit rice crop productivity
    + Furthermore, we show by bimolecular complementation assays that OsCPK10 is a plasma membrane protein that physically interacts in vivo with catalase A
