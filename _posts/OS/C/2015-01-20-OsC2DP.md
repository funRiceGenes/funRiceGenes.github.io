* **Key message**  
    + Knockout of OsC2DP did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress
    + Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, OsC2DP required for salt tolerance in rice
    + OsC2DP was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress
    + Immunostaining further showed that OsC2DP was able to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane under salt conditions
    + These results indicate that OsC2DP has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of OsC2DP gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance
    + OsC2DP is a cytosolic protein containing a C2 domain recently identified in rice, which is translocated to the plasma membrane in response to salt stress
    + These results indicated that the subcellular localization was determined by C2 domain of OsC2DP under normal conditions and that both N- and C-terminus of OsC2DP are essential for its cytosol-plasma membrane translocation in response to salt stress
