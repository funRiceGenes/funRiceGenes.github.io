* **Key message**  
    + OsCOL16 expression exhibits a diurnal oscillation and serves as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity
    + We determined that OsCOL16 up-regulates the expression of the floral repressor Ghd7, leading to down-regulation of the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1
    + Moreover, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses suggest that remarkable differences in flowering times correlate with two major alleles of OsCOL16
