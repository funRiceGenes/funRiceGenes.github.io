## Connection
1. __OsCaM61__, __OsCBK__, [Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61%5BTitle%5D),  It was observed that OsCaM61 stimulated OsCBK in a Ca2+-dependent manner
2. __OsCaM61__, __OsCBK__, [Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61%5BTitle%5D),  Mutational study and fluorescent spectroscopy analysis indicated that CaM-binding affinity does not correlate with the kinase activity and that these key amino-acids in OsCaM61 play a vital role in suitable changes of OsCBK conformation for kinase activation
