## Expression information

## Key message
1. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days
2. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment
3. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways
4. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB
5. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)), OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB

## Connection
1. __Hd3a__, __OsCOL4__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants
2. __OsCOL4__, __RFT1__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants
3. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL4__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants
4. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL4__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1
5. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL4__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1
6. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL4__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)), OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
7. __OsCOL4__, __PHYB~OsphyB__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB
8. __OsCOL4__, __PHYB~OsphyB__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)),  These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1
