* **Key message**  
    + Role of OIP30 and OsCPK26 in mature pollen

* **Connection**  
    + __OIP30__, __OsCPK26__, [OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice%5BTitle%5D), The interaction between OsCPK26 and OIP30 was confirmed by far-Western blot and pull-down experiments
    + __OIP30__, __OsCPK26__, [OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice%5BTitle%5D), OIP30 was phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner by OsCPK26 but not OsCPK2, which is highly similar to OsCPK26 in sequence and expression profile
    + __OIP30__, __OsCPK26__, [OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsCPK26 phosphorylated OIP30 and enhanced both its helicase and ATPase activity about 3-fold
