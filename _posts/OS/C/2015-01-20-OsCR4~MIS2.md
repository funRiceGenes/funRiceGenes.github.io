* **Key message**  
    + Here, we showed that when OsCR4 mRNA expression was knocked down in rice by RNA interference, the palea and lemma separated at later spikelet stages and gradually turned brown after heading, resulting in the severe interruption of pistil pollination and damage to the development of embryo and endosperm, with defects in aleurone
    + An analysis of promoter::GUS reporter plants showed that OsCR4 is specifically expressed in the epidermal cells of paleas and lemmas
    + Together, these results suggest that OsCR4 plays an essential role in maintaining the interlocking of the palea and lemma by promoting epidermal cell differentiation
    + Together, our results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes, which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706 and OsCR4
    + Microscopic analysis revealed that the spikelet epidermal cell size was reduced but the cell number was increased in the mis2 mutant, suggesting that MIS2 controls grain size by coordinately regulating epidermal cell size and cell number
    + Map-based cloning revealed that MIS2 encodes a receptor-like kinase CRINKLY4 (CR4) which showed the highest expression in developing panicles
    + The MIS2 protein is localized primarily on the plasma membrane along with the endosome
    + Receptor-like kinase OsCR4 controls leaf morphogenesis and embryogenesis by fixing the distribution of auxin in rice
    + Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the receptor-like kinase OsCR4 in leaf development
    + OsWOX3A, which is auxin responsive and related to leaf development, was activated extensively and ectopically in oscr4 leaves, partially accounting for the observed lack of cell differentiation
    + Our data suggest that OsCR4 plays a fundamental role in leaf morphogenesis and embryogenesis by fixing the distribution of auxin
    + The delayed outgrowth of the first three leaves and seminal root in oscr4 was due to defects in plumule and radicle formation during embryogenesis
    + Signals from the auxin reporter DR5rev:VENUS were found to be altered in oscr4 embryos and disorganized in oscr4 leaves, in which indole-3-acetic acid accumulation was further revealed by immunofluorescence
