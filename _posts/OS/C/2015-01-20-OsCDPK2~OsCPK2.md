* **Key message**  
    + High levels of OsCDPK2 were detected in leaves removed from etiolated plants, as well as in stems and flowers
    + The morphological phenotype of transgenic plants producing high levels of recombinant OsCDPK2 was normal until the onset of seed development
    + Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK2 in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development
    + OsCDPK2 protein was expressed at low levels during early seed development, but increased to high levels that were maintained in later stages (20 days after fertilisation, DAF)
    + Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development
    + OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles
    + OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]
    + OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development
