* **Key message**  
    + Knockdown of OsCERK1 resulted in marked suppression of the defense responses induced by chitin oligosaccharides, indicating that OsCERK1 is essential for chitin signaling in rice
    + OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity
    + Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice.
    + The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling
    + CERK1 in rice has the highest homology to NFR1 and we show that this gene is also necessary for the establishment of the mycorrhizal interaction as well as for resistance to the rice blast fungus.
    + We show here that knockout (KO) mutants of OsCERK1, a rice receptor kinase essential for chitin signaling, were impaired not only for chitin-triggered defense responses but also for AM symbiosis, indicating the bifunctionality of OsCERK1 in defense and symbiosis
    + These results also suggest that OsCERK1 and homologs serve as a molecular switch that activates defense or symbiotic responses depending on the infecting microbes
    + On the other hand, a KO mutant of OsCEBiP, which forms a receptor complex with OsCERK1 and is essential for chitin-triggered immunity, established mycorrhizal symbiosis normally
    + Therefore, OsCERK1 but not chitin-triggered immunity is required for AM symbiosis
    + Furthermore, experiments with chimeric receptors showed that the kinase domains of OsCERK1 and homologs from non-leguminous, mycorrhizal plants could trigger nodulation signaling in legume-rhizobium interactions as the kinase domain of Nod factor receptor1 (NFR1), which is essential for triggering the nodulation program in leguminous plants, did
    + Here, we found that the PRR-associated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase Oryza sativa RLCK185 transmits immune signaling from the PAMP receptor OsCERK1 to a MAPK signaling cascade through interaction with a MAPK kinase kinase, OsMAPKKK, which is the initial kinase of the MAPK cascade
    + Following the recent discovery that the Oscerk1 mutant is unable to host arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, we have examined whether OsCERK1 is directly involved in the perception of the short-chain chitin oligomers (Myc-COs) identified in AM fungal exudates and shown to activate nuclear calcium (Ca(2+) ) spiking in the rice root epidermis
    + Compared with wild-type rice, Ca(2+) spiking responses to AM fungal elicitation were absent in root atrichoblasts of the Oscerk1 mutant
    + By contrast, rice lines mutated in OsCEBiP, encoding the LysM receptor-like protein which associates with OsCERK1 to perceive chitin elicitors of the host immune defense pathway, responded positively to Myc-COs
    + The rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1 is required for the perception of short-chain chitin oligomers in arbuscular mycorrhizal signaling.
    + The rice lysin-motif (LysM) receptor-like kinase OsCERK1 is now known to have a dual role in both pathogenic and symbiotic interactions
    + OsCERK1 plays a crucial role in the lipopolysaccharide-induced immune response of rice.
    + We conclude that OsCERK1 is a key gene affecting the symbiotic interaction with AMF and OsCERK1DY has the biotechnological potential to increase rice phosphorus acquisition and utilization efficiency for sustainable agriculture
    + Natural variation at OsCERK1 regulates arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.
    + Poaceae-specific cell wall-derived oligosaccharides activate plant immunity via OsCERK1 during Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice
    + In addition, these Poaceae cell wall-specific oligosaccharides trigger a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is largely compromised in oscerk1 and oscebip mutants
    + We conclude that 31-β-D-Cellobiosyl-glucose and 31-β-D-Cellotriosyl-glucose are specific DAMPs released from the hemicellulose of rice cell wall, which are perceived by an OsCERK1 and OsCEBiP immune complex during M
    + Addendum: Poaceae-specific cell wall-derived oligosaccharides activate plant immunity via OsCERK1 during Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice
    + These findings illuminate how the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit orchestrate rice immunity through the small GTPase OsRac1
    + Supporting this result, OsCERK1 and Pit utilized different transport systems for anchorage to the plasma membrane
