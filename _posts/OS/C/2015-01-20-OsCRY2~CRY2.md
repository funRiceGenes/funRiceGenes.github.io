* **Key message**  
    + Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus
    + In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice
