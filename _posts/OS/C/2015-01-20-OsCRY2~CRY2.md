    + [AB103094](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB103094)

* **Key message**  
    + Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus
    + In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __OsBBX14__, __OsCRY2~CRY2__, [OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis in rice by activating OsHY5L1 expression under blue light conditions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis in rice by activating OsHY5L1 expression under blue light conditions.%5BTitle%5D),  LUC complementation imaging (LCI) results suggested that OsBBX14 had physical interaction with OsCRY2 protein
