## Key message
1. __flower__, [Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus
2. __flower__, [Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice
3. __flowering time__, [Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice
