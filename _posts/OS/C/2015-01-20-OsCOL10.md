* **Key message**  
    + OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days
