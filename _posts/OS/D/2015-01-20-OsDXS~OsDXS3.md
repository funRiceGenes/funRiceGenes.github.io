    + [AK100909](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK100909)

* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
