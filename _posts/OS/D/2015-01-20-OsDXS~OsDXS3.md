## Connection
1. __OsDXR__, __OsDXS~OsDXS3__, [Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase DXR), and 4-cytidine 5'-diphospho-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E
2. __OsDXR__, __OsDXS~OsDXS3__, [Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor
3. __OsDXS~OsDXS3__, __OsTGAP1~OsbZIP37__, [Identification of target genes of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, whose overexpression causes elicitor-induced hyperaccumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of target genes of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, whose overexpression causes elicitor-induced hyperaccumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells.%5BTitle%5D),  A subsequent transactivation assay further confirmed the direct regulation of OsDXS3 expression by OsTGAP1, but other MEP pathway genes were not included among the OsTGAP1 target genes
