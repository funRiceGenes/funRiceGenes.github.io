* **Key message**  
    + Overall, OsD-LDH2 emerged as a promising candidate which can open a new direction for engineering stress tolerant crop varieties by maintaining their growth and yield in unfavorable conditions
    + Heterologous overexpression of OsD-LDH2 provides tolerance against multiple abiotic stresses in E
    + The analysis of D-LDH mutant and OsD-LDH2 overexpressing transgenic plants uncovered the crucial role of D-LDH in mitigation of abiotic stresses
