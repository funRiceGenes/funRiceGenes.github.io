* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsDhn1 was strongly induced by low temperature as well as by drought
    + GUS assay of OsDhn1::gus plants showed that the GUS activity in the leaves was induced by drought stress but not by wound, cold, salt, or ABA treatment
    + Induction of OsDhn1 by cold stress was clearcut in the roots of seedlings and the epidermis of palea and lemma
    + Characterization of an abiotic stress-inducible dehydrin gene, OsDhn1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Taken together, these suggest that the drought-inducible OsDhn1 gene is regulated by abiotic stress signaling pathway involving CBF/DREB
    + Drought inducible OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A and OsDREB1D
    + 1 kb cDNA, designated Oryza sativa Dehydrin 1 (OsDhn1), was isolated from the seed coat of rice
