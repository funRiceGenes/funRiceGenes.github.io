* **Key message**  
    + OsDIAT-overexpressing (OsDIATOX) plants were more tolerant to drought stress, whereas osdiat plants were more susceptible to drought stress compared to non-transgenic (NT) plants
    + Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDIAT mediates drought tolerance by promoting the accumulation of BCAAs
    + The expression of OsDIAT was induced in plants upon exposure to abiotic stress
    + An in vitro enzyme activity assay indicated that OsDIAT is a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), and subcellular localization analysis revealed that OsDIAT localizes to the cytoplasm
