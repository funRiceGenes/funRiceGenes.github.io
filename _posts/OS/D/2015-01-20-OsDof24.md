* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show a novel function for OsDOF24 as a repressor of leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + The gain-of-function mutant osdof24-D, which contains an enhancer-trap T-DNA in the OsDOF24 promoter, exhibited delayed leaf yellowing during NS and DIS
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways
    + In wild-type leaves, OsDOF24 expression rapidly decreased during natural senescence (NS) and dark-induced senescence (DIS)
    + Among the phytohormones, only methyl jasmonate induced OsDOF24 expression
