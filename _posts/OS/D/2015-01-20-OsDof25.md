## Publication

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Over-expression of OsDof25 enhanced the expression of OsC4PPDK in transient expression experiments by binding in a specific way to a conserved Dof binding site which was confirmed by yeast and in vitro binding studies |  Expression studies using promoter GUS plants as well as qPCR experiments showed that OsDof25 expressed in different tissues including both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs and that expression of OsDof25 was partially overlapping with the OsC4PPDK gene |  Conclusive evidence for a role of OsDof25 in regulation of C4PPDK came from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments with transgenic rice, which showed that down-regulation or over-expression of OsDof25 correlated with OsC4PPDK expression and that OsDof25 has functions as transcriptional activator

## Key message
1. __photosynthesis__, [Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report on the analysis of OsDof25 and show a function in regulation of the important C4 photosynthesis gene, OsC4PPDK in rice
2. __transcriptional activator__, [Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.%5BTitle%5D)),  Conclusive evidence for a role of OsDof25 in regulation of C4PPDK came from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments with transgenic rice, which showed that down-regulation or over-expression of OsDof25 correlated with OsC4PPDK expression and that OsDof25 has functions as transcriptional activator
