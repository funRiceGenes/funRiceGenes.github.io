* **Key message**  
    + The Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDHSRP1 exhibited hypersensitivity to drought, heat, and NaCl stress and a decrease in their germination rates and root lengths compared to the control plants because the degradation of the OsGLYI-11
    + The OsDHSRP1 gene transcripts were highly expressed under various abiotic stresses such as NaCl, drought, and heat and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA)
    + Our finding supports the hypothesis that the OsDHSRP1 E3 ligase acts as a negative regulator, and the degradation of its substrate proteins via ubiquitination plays important roles in regulating various abiotic stress responses via an ABA-independent pathway
