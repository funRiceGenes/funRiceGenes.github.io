* **Key message**  
    + OsClo5 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by interacting with OsDi19-5 to negatively affect salt stress tolerance in rice seedlings
    + In addition, OsClo5 enhanced the inhibitory effect of OsDi19-5 in the tobacco transient system, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in rice seedlings under salt stress
