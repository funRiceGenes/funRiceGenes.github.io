## Connection
1. __OsDBH__, __OsDSHCT__, [microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The present miRNAs were predicted to target the OsABP (ATP-Binding Protein), OsDSHCT (DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase) and OsDBH (DEAD-Box Helicase) genes, included in the DEAD-box helicase family
2. __OsDBH__, __OsDSHCT__, [microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes were up-regulated in response to 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments
3. __OsDBH__, __OsDSHCT__, [microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  CONCLUSIONS: Osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408 were experimentally validated for the first time in plants as targeting the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes
