* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB2B showed enhanced expression of DREB2A target genes and improved drought and heat-shock stress tolerance
    + These results suggest that OsDREB2B is a key gene that encodes a stress-inducible DREB2-type transcription factor that functions in stress-responsive gene expression in rice
    + Only OsDREB2A and OsDREB2B showed abiotic stress-inducible gene expression
