## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Overexpression of OsDi19-4 in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity |  Overexpression of one stress-responsive gene, OsDi19-4, in rice resulted in significantly increased tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild type plants  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of OsDi19-4 in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity |  Overexpression of one stress-responsive gene, OsDi19-4, in rice resulted in significantly increased tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild type plants  
__RNAi__:
