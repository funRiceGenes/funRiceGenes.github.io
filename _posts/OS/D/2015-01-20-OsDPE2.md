* **Key message**  
    + The optimum reaction temperature was 30°C for OsDPE1 and 39°C for OsDPE2
    + Cytosolic DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2 is essential for pollen germination and pollen tube elongation in rice
    + In this study, OsDPE2 affected the vegetative plant development of rice via DPE2 enzyme
    + Additionally, OsDPE2 regulated the reproductive plant development of rice by modulating starch content in young panicles
    + In summary, OsDPE2 can regulate vegetative and reproductive plant development of rice by modulating starch content
    + OsDPE2 Regulates Rice Panicle Morphogenesis by Modulating the Content of Starch.
    + Furthermore, DPE2 activities of OsDPE2 haplotypes are associated with the panicle yield of rice
    + OsDPE2 encodes rice DPE2 located in the cytoplasm
