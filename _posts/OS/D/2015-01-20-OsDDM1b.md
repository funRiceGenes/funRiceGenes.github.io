* **Key message**  
    + OsDDM1b Controls Grain Size by Influencing Cell Cycling and Regulating Homeostasis and Signaling of Brassinosteroid in Rice.
    + We further analyzed the OsDDM1b T-DNA insertion loss-of-function of mutant, which exhibited dwarfism, smaller organ size, and shorter and wider grain size than the wild type (Hwayoung, HY), yet no difference in 1,000-grain weight
    + Consistent with the grain size, the outer parenchyma cell layers of lemma in osddm1b developed more cells with decreased size
    + OsDDM1b encoded a nucleus, membrane-localized protein and was distributed predominately in young spikelets and seeds, asserting its role in grain size
    + We detected changes in the expression levels of the BR signaling pathway and feedback-inhibited genes with and without exogenous BR application, and the alterations of expression were also observed in grain size-related genes in the osddm1b
    + Altogether, our results suggest that OsDDM1b plays a crucial role in grain size via influencing cell proliferation and regulating BR signaling and homeostasis
    + Meanwhile, the osddm1b was less sensitive to brassinosteroids (BRs) while the endogenous BR levels increased
