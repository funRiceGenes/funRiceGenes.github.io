* **Key message**  
    + Strong loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants that expressed inverted repeats of OsDCL1 resulted in developmental arrest at the seedling stage, and weak loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants caused pleiotropic developmental defects
    + Repression of microRNA biogenesis by silencing of OsDCL1 activates the basal resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.
    + Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and cell death were observed in the contact cells with infectious hyphae, revealing that silencing of OsDCL1 activated cellular defense responses
    + Moreover, silencing of OsDCL1 activated the constitutive expression of defense related genes
    + In this study, we reported the function of OsDCL1 in the immunity to rice blast, the devastating disease caused by the fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae
    + Expression profiling demonstrated that different OsDCLs responded dynamically and OsDCL1 reduced its expression upon the challenge of rice blast pathogen
    + In OsDCL1 RNAi lines, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 5 and 7 were down- and up-regulated, respectively, indicating that miRNAs responded dynamically in the interaction between rice and rice blast
    + OsDCL1a activation impairs phytoalexin biosynthesis and compromises disease resistance in rice.
    + Activation-tagged Osdcl1a (Osdcl1a-Ac) rice mutants were examined for resistance to pathogen infection
    + These findings provide a basis to understand the molecular mechanisms through which OsDCL1a mediates rice immunity
    + Activation of OsDCL1a represses the pathogen-inducible host defence response and negatively regulates diterpenoid phytoalexin production
