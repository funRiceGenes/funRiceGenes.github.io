* **Key message**  
    + CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
    + We provide evidence that CAL1 acts by chelating Cd in the cytosol and facilitating Cd secretion to extracellular spaces, hence lowering cytosolic Cd concentration while driving long-distance Cd transport via xylem vessels
    + OsAFP1 exerted fungicidal activity against Candida albicans, the most common pathogenic fungus in humans, at 4<U+2009>¦ÌM concentration, but it did not inhibit the growth of human pathogenic bacteria
    + Immunohistochemistry showed that the OsAFP1 target molecule was located in the cell wall
    + Further, PI uptake and apoptosis assays suggested that OsAFP1 exerts its antifungal activity by inducing apoptosis of target cells
    + Partial peptides from rice defensin OsAFP1 exhibited antifungal activity against the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae.
    + In lipid-binding analyses performed using nitrocellulose membranes immobilized with various membrane lipid components, OsAFP1 was found to bind to phosphatidylinositols (PIPs) harboring phosphate groups, particularly PI(3)P
