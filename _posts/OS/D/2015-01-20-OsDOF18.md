* **Key message**  
    + The growth of null mutants of<U+00A0>OsDOF18 was retarded in a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source
    + These results provide evidence that OsDOF18 mediates ammonium transport and nitrogen distribution, which then affects nitrogen use efficiency
    + Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.
    + Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1,<U+00A0>OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18
    + Uptake of ammonium was lower in osdof18 mutants than in the wild type, while that of nitrate was not affected by the mutation
