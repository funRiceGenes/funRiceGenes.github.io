## Key message
1. __seedling__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)), The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage
2. __chloroplast__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)), KEY MESSAGE: OsDG2 gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted GRP in rice
3. __chloroplast__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
4. __chloroplast__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  Subcellular localization results showed that OsDG2 was targeted in chloroplasts
5. __chloroplast__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  In osdg2 mutant, the expression levels of most genes associated with chloroplast development were severely decreased in the 3rd leaves, but almost recovered to wild-type level in the 4th leaves
6. __chloroplast__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
7. __chloroplast__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)), The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage
8. __leaf__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
9. __leaf__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identified a rice GRP gene mutant named osdg2 (O ryza s ativa d elayed g reening 2), which exhibits delayed greening phenotype characterized as bright yellow leaves before the three-leaf stage and thereafter turns to normal green
10. __leaf__, [The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage%5BTitle%5D)),  Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice
