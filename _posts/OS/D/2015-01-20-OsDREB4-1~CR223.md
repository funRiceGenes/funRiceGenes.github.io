## Key message
1. __sheath__, [OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element%5BTitle%5D)),  Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
2. __growth__, [OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDREB4 genes in rice encode AP2-containing proteins that bind specifically to the dehydration-responsive element%5BTitle%5D)),  Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of OsDREB4-1 and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath
