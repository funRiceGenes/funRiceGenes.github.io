## Key message
1. __salt__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D), " Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"

3. __salt stress__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D), " Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
4. __drought__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D), " We recently showed that OsDIS1 Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice
5. __drought__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice
6. __drought__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
