* **Key message**  
    + Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice
    + Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance
    + We recently showed that OsDIS1 (Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice
    + OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice
    + Here, we report that OsDIS1 (for Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a C3HC4 RING finger E3 ligase, is involved in drought-stress signal transduction in rice (O
    + The expression of OsDIS1 was up-regulated by drought treatment
    + Microarray analysis revealed that a large number of drought-responsive genes were induced or suppressed in the OsDIS1 overexpression plants under normal and drought conditions
    + Together, these results demonstrate that OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and possibly through posttranslational regulation of OsNek6 in rice
    + The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice

    + __OsDIS1__, __OsSKIPa__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D), Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice
