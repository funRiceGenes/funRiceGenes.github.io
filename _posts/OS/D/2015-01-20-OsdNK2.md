* **Key message**  
    + In particular, the expression levels of OsdNK2 in mature leaves, stems, sheathes, and panicles were much higher than WSL8 (Fig. 7a), suggesting OsdNK2 might play a major role in the later stages of plant growth.
    + Hence, we deduced the OsdNK2 might partially compensate the function of WSL8 at the late stages of rice growth.
