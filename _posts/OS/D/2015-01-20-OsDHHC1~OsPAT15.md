* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we cloned a novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene Os02g0819100 and its alternative splice variant OsDHHC1 from the cDNA of rice (Oryza sativa L
    + OsPAT15 (OsDHHC1), a novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene, was reported to regulate rice plant architecture by altering the tillering
    + Increasing branch and seed yield through heterologous expression of the novel rice S-acyl transferase gene OsPAT15 in Brassica napus L.
    + As anticipated, OsPAT15 transgenic plants exhibited branching and seed yield
    + In this study, the DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene OsPAT15 was determined to have sulfur acyl transferase activity in the akr1<a6><a4> yeast mutant in a complementation experiment
