* **Key message**  
    + OsDIRP1 expression was induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, but not by low temperature (4Â°C) stress, suggesting that OsDIRP1 is differentially regulated by different abiotic stresses
    + These results suggest that OsDIRP1 acts as a negative regulator during drought and salt stress, whereas it functions as a positive factor during the cold stress response in rice
    + In this study, we identified and characterized OsDIRP1 (Oryza sativa Drought-Induced RING Protein 1), a nuclear-localized putative RING E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase in rice (Oryza sativa L
