* **Key message**  
    + The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions
    + These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14
    + Here, we further investigated the other important agronomical traits of the transgenic plants overexpressing OsDof12 and found that overexpressing OsDof12 could lead to reduced plant height, erected leaf, shortened leaf blade, and smaller panicle resulted from decreased primary and secondary branches number
    + Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + These results implied that OsDof12 is involved in rice plant architecture formation
    + Taken together, our results suggested that overexpression of OsDof12 could lead to altered plant architecture by suppressing BR signaling
    + Thus, OsDof12 might be used as a new potential genetic regulator for future rice molecular breeding
    + Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice
    + Furthermore, we performed a series of Brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive tests and found that overexpression of OsDof12 could also result in BR hyposensitivity
