## Expression information
__Expression__:Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.). |  Furthermore, we performed a series of Brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive tests and found that overexpression of OsDof12 could also result in BR hyposensitivity |  Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice |  Taken together, our results suggested that overexpression of OsDof12 could lead to altered plant architecture by suppressing BR signaling
