* **Key message**  
    + The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold
    + Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in T(2) transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that OsDREB1B shows stress-specific induction pattern in response to a variety of stresses like mannitol, NaCl, PEG, methyl viologen, cold, ABA, and salicylic acid
    + Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B
    + Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses
    + However, here it is shown that OsDREB1B is not only induced by low temperatures, but also by drought and mechanical stress
    + The data obtained provide strong in vivo evidence that OsDREB1B is involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, and confers broad-spectrum stress tolerance to transgenic plants
    + Isolation, optimization, and functional analysis of the cDNA encoding transcription factor OsDREB1B in Oryza Sativa L
    + Results indicated that the OsDREB1BI gene was over-expressed in transgenic plants under cold and high-temperature, meanwhile, those transgenic plants also revealed freezing and heat tolerance
    + Overexpression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also improved the oxidative and freezing stress tolerance of transgenic plants
