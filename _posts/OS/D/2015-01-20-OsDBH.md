    + Expression profiles of OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCTgenes in response to early salinity stress

    + __OsDBH__, __OsDSHCT__, [microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), The present miRNAs were predicted to target the OsABP (ATP-Binding Protein), OsDSHCT (DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase) and OsDBH (DEAD-Box Helicase) genes, included in the DEAD-box helicase family
    + __OsDBH__, __OsDSHCT__, [microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes were up-regulated in response to 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments
