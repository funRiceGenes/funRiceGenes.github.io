* **Key message**  
    + A rice seed-specific glycine-rich protein OsDOR1 interacts with GID1 to repress GA signaling and regulates seed dormancy.
    + Based on these findings, we suggest that OsDOR1 is a novel negative player of GA signaling operated in the maintenance of seed dormancy
    + Here, we demonstrated that OsDOR1 protein binds to the GA receptor protein, OsGID1 in rice protoplasts, and interrupts with the formation OsGID1-OsSLR1 complex in yeast cells
    + Co-expression of OsDOR1 with OsGID1 in rice protoplasts attenuated the GA-dependent degradation of OsSLR1, the key repressor of GA signaling
