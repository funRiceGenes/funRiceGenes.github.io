* **Key message**  
    + qRT-PCR analysis of 29 related genes suggested that defects of the OsDRB2-miR166-OsHBs pathway could play an important role in formation of the rolled leaf phenotype of rl89, in which OsDRB2 mutation reduced miR166 accumulation, resulting in elevated expressions of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (such as OsHB1, 3 and 5) involved in leaf polarity and/or morphology development
    + Moreover, OsDRB2 mutation also reduced accumulation of miR160, miR319, miR390, and miR396, which could cause the abnormal leaf development in rl89 by regulating expressions of their target genes related to leaf development
    + The srl10 mutant had a semi-rolled leaf phenotype and elevated sensitivity to high temperature
    + The natural Hap3 (AGC) type of SRL10 allele was found to be present in the majority of aus rice accessions, and was identified as a thermotolerant allele under high temperature stress in both the field and the growth chamber
    + SRL10 directly interacted with catalase isozyme B (CATB), and the two proteins mutually increased one other&#x27;s stability to enhance hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) scavenging, thereby contributing to thermotolerance
