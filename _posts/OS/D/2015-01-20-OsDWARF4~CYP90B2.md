* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsDWARF4,CYP90B2  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g12660](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g12660)  
    + RAPdb: [Os03g0227700](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os03g0227700)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2006, Nat Biotechnol.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AB206579](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB206579)

* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that the erect leaf phenotype of a rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, osdwarf4-1, is associated with enhanced grain yields under conditions of dense planting, even without extra fertilizer
    + Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and CYP724B1/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis
    + Therefore, despite the central role of brassinosteroids in plant growth and development, mutation of OsDWARF4 alone causes only limited defects in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and plant morphology
