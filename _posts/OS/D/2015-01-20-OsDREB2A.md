* **Key message**  
    + We developed 30 transgenic T(0) rice plants overexpressing OsDREB2A which were devoid of any growth penalty or phenotypic abnormalities during stressed or non-stressed conditions
    + T(2) and T(3) transgenic lines over-expressing OsDREB2A were found to have improved survival rates under severe drought and salt stress conditions relative to non-transgenic rice plants or rice plants transformed with the empty vector control
    + Expression of OsDREB2A transcription factor confers enhanced dehydration and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + OsDREB2A expression was found to be markedly induced by drought and ABA treatment
    + Induced over-expression of the transcription factor OsDREB2A improves drought tolerance in rice
    + Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses
    + In this study, the rice OsDREB2A gene was isolated and expressed under the control of a stress-inducible promoter (4ABRC) to improve the abiotic stress tolerance of japonica rice variety TNG67
    + OsDREB2A expression is induced by drought, low-temperature and salt stresses
    + Here, we report the ability of OsDREB2A to regulate high-salt response in transgenic soybean
    + Overexpressing OsDREB2A in soybeans enhanced salt tolerance by accumulating osmolytes, such as soluble sugars and free proline, and improving the expression levels of some stress-responsive transcription factors and key genes
    + Overexpression of OsDREB2A in soybean might be used to improve tolerance to salt stress
    + OsDREB2A, a Rice Transcription Factor, Significantly Affects Salt Tolerance in Transgenic Soybean
    + The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress
    + OsDREB2A, a member of the DREBP subfamily of AP2/ERF transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa), is involved in the abiotic stress response
    + These results indicate that OsDREB2A may participate in abiotic stress by directly binding with DRE element to regulate the expression of downstream genes
