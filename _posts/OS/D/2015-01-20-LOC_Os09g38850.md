* **Key message**  
    + A detailed investigation of the ovaries from OsDEES1 RNA interference plants indicated that the knockdown of OsDEES1 expression did not affect megasporogenesis but that it disturbed female gametophyte formation, resulting in a degenerated embryo sac and defective seed formation
    + OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
    + OsDEES1 silencing by RNA interference caused a high rate of female sterility
    + Crossing experiments showed that female reproductive organs lacking OsDEES1 carried a functional defect
    + While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
    + Finally, we show that OsWAK91 is required for H2O2 production and sufficient to enhance defense gene expression during infection
