* **Key message**  
    + The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment
    + Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, OsDWARF, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF
    + Introduction of the wild-type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants
