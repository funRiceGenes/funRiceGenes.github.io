* **Key message**  
    + OsDOG1L-3 regulates seed dormancy through the abscisic acid pathway in rice
    + There were evident promoter and expression differences in OsDOG1L-3 between N22 and Nanjing35, and overexpression or introduction of the N22 OsDOG1L-3 allele in Nanjing35 enhanced its seed dormancy
    + OsDOG1L-3 expression was positively correlated with seed dormancy and induced by ABA
    + Overexpression of OsbZIP75 increased OsDOG1L-3 protein abundance and promoted seed dormancy
    + We propose that the N22 OsDOG1L-3 allele is a candidate gene for the seed dormancy in QTL qSd-1-1, and that it participates in the ABA pathway to establish seed dormancy in rice
    + OsDOG1L-3 upregulated expression of ABA-related genes and increased ABA content
