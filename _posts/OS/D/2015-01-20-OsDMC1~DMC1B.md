* **Key message**  
    + The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility
    + The sterility phenotypes were associated with down-regulated OsDMC1 transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi
    + OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings
    + Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis
    + Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock-down of OsDMC1 led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression
    + DNA binding and pairing activities of Oryza sativa disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (OsDmc1) from rice have been reported earlier
    + A cloned cDNA corresponding to OsDMC1 from rice anther tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli
    + Here, we analyzed the function of OsDMC1 in meiosis using an RNA interference approach
    + These data indicate that OsDMC1 is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing
    + These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice
    + Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
    + The reduced number of bivalents and abnormal OsHEI10 foci in Osdmc1a Osdmc1b establishes an essential role for OsDMC1 in crossover formation
