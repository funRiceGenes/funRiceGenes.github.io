* **Key message**  
    + Here we reported that knockdown of OsDCL3b led to reduced pollen fertility, seed setting rate, and decreased grain yield but increased grain quality in rice
    + In rice, the biochemical function of OsDCL3b is known to process 24-nucleotide panicle phased small RNAs, however, its phenotypic functions are unclear
    + OsDCL3b affects grain yield and quality in rice.
    + We reported that knockdown of OsDCL3b decreased grain yield but increased grain quality in rice, which is helpful for molecular breeding in crops
    + Thus, our results show that knockdown of OsDCL3b will affect the biogenesis of small RNAs, which is involved in regulating the transcription of mRNA genes, and consequently influence the grain yield and quality in rice
