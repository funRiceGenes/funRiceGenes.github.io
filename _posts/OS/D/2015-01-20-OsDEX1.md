* **Key message**  
    + Here we report a role of OsDEX1 (Defective in Exine Formation 1 in rice), a Ca2+ binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation
    + In osdex1 anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility
    + Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca2+ in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects in an Arabidopsis dex1 mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation during pollen development
    + Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a conserved role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via changing the Ca2+ homeostasis during pollen development
    + OsDEX1 transcript is observed in tapetal cells and microspores during the early anther development
    + Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca2+ and regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in vitro, and osdex1 showed disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in tapetal cells
