* **Key message**  
    + Under methylglyoxal treatment, silencing of OsD-LDH in rice resulted in the accumulation of methylglyoxal and D-lactate, the decrease of reduced glutathione in leaves, and ultimately severe growth inhibition
    + However, the silencing of OsD-LDH did not affect the growth under photorespiration conditions
    + Moreover, the detached leaves of OsD-LDH RNAi plants were more sensitive to salt stress
