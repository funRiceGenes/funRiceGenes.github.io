* **Key message**  
    + Results indicated that the over-expression of OsDREB1D conferred cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic plants, and that transgenic plants were also insensitive to ABA (abscisic acid)
    + Expression of a rice DREB1 gene, OsDREB1D, enhances cold and high-salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis
    + Drought inducible OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A and OsDREB1D
    + From these data, we deduced that this OsDREB1D gene functions similarly as other DREB transcription factors
