* **Key message**  
    + In the osdsg1 mutant, transcript levels of ABA signaling genes and ABA responsive genes were significantly increased
    + These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds
    + There, T-DNA was inserted into Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), causing a recessive null mutation
    + A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice
