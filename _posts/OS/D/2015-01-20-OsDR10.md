* **Key message**  
    + A rice gene of de novo origin negatively regulates pathogen-induced defense response.
    + Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10-suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease.
    + Suppression of OsDR10 enhances resistance to bacterial blight
    + OsDR10-suppressed plants showed enhanced disease resistance not only at the adult stage but also at the seedling stage.
