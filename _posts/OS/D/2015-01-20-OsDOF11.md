    + Rice Transcription Factor OsDOF11 Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes.
    + Although sucrose enhanced root elongation in young wild-type (WT) seedlings, this did not occur in osdof11 seedlings due to reduced sucrose uptake
    + Sugar transport rate analyses revealed that less sugar was transported in osdof11 plants than in the WT
    + We also observed that osdof11 mutant plants were less susceptible to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae, suggesting that OsDOF11 participates in sugar distribution during pathogenic invasions
    + Collectively, these results suggest that OsDOF11 modulates sugar transport by regulating expression of SUT and SWEET genes in rice
    + Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that OsDOF11 directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that OsDOF11 coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading
    + OsDOF11 Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Here, we note that OsDOF11 promotes nitrogen uptake and then maintains the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight in seedling plants and the effective leaf blade at flowering stages
    + Both sugar and organic nitrogen changes caused the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight to decrease in OsDOF11 mutant seedling plants and mature leaves, which might result in vigorous reduced metabolic activity and become less susceptible to stress
    + These results demonstrated that OsDOF11 affected nitrogen metabolism by sugar distribution in rice, which provided new insight that OsDOF11 coordinated with C and N balance to maintain plant growth activity
    + Mutants of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET14 displayed a phenotype similar to that of OsDOF11
    + The sucrose transport regulator OsDOF11 mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development.
    + Here, we found that OsDOF11 loss-of-function mutants showed a semi-dwarf phenotype with a smaller cell length due to increased cytokinin content in source tissues
    + RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses revealed that genes involved in cytokinin signaling and metabolism were affected in osdof11 mutants
    + sativa VIN3-LIKE 2 caused an increase in active cytokinin levels and induced OsDOF11 transcript levels
