    + The Ubiquitin-Binding Protein OsDSK2a Mediates Seedling Growth and Salt Responses by Regulating Gibberellin Metabolism in Rice.
    + Here, we demonstrate that the novel UBL-UBA protein OsDSK2a (DOMINANT SUPPRESSOR of KAR2) mediates seedling growth and salt responses in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Bioactive GA levels were reduced and plant growth was retarded in the osdsk2a mutant
    + Thus, OsDSK2a and EUI play opposite roles in regulating plant growth under salt stress by affecting GA metabolism
    + Downregulation of the ubiquitin-binding receptor OsDSK2a increases EUI accumulation, which promotes GA metabolism and reduces plant growth under salt stress
    + Through analysis of osdsk2a, a mutant with retarded seedling growth, as well as in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that OsDSK2a combines with polyubiquitin chains and interacts with the gibberellin (GA)-deactivating enzyme ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE (EUI), resulting in its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system
    + OsDSK2a levels decreased in plant under salt stress
    + Moreover, EUI accumulated under salt stress more rapidly in osdsk2a than in wild-type plants
