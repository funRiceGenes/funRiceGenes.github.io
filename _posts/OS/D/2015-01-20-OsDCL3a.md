* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle
    + Impairing OsDCL3a expression by RNA interference caused phenotypes affecting important agricultural traits; these phenotypes include dwarfism, larger flag leaf angle, and fewer secondary branches

* **Connection**  
    + __OsDCL3a__, __OsDCL3b__, [Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis%5BTitle%5D), Surprisingly, the processing of 24-nucleotide phased small RNA requires the DCL3 homolog OsDCL3b rather than OsDCL3a, suggesting functional divergence within DCL3 family
    + __Ghd2~OsK__, __OsDCL3a__, [Translational repression by a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element in the 3' untranslated region.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Translational repression by a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element in the 3' untranslated region.%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, the translational repression of Ghd2 by the sMITE mainly relies on Dicer-like 3a (OsDCL3a)
