* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, OsDREB1G is a typical CBF/DREB1 transcription factor that specifically functions in the cold stress response
    + However, unlike these rice lines, transgenic rice overexpressing OsDREB1G did not exhibit significant increases in drought or salt tolerance
    + Therefore, OsDREB1G could be useful for developing transgenic rice with enhanced cold-stress tolerance
    + OsDREB1G is specifically induced under cold stress conditions among several abiotic stresses examined
