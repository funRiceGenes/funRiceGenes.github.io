* **Key message**  
    + OsDES1 interacts with LONELY GUY (LOG), a cytokinin-activating enzyme that acts in the final step of cytokinin synthesis; mutation of LOG led to defective female reproductive organ development
    + These results demonstrate that OsDES1 functions in determining the rice seed-setting rate by regulating embryo sac development and fertilization
    + The OsDES1 mutation disrupts the normal formation of functional megaspores, which ultimately results in a degenerated embryo sac in des1
