* **Key message**  
    + The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment
    + Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, OsDWARF, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF
    + Introduction of the wild-type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants
    + Genetic disruption of OsBR6ox increased rice sensitivity and led to more accumulation of ATZ and ACT, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing OsBR6ox lines (OEs) showed opposite effects with improved growth and lower ATZ and ACT accumulation in various tissues, including grains
    + OsBR6ox was transcriptionally induced under ATZ and ACT stress
    + Such an epigenetic modification marker was responsible for the increased OsBR6ox expression and consequent detoxification of ATZ/ACT in rice and environment
