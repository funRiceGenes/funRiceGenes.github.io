## Key message
1. __cold stress__, [OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling%5BTitle%5D),  OsDEG10 RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants
2. __abiotic stress__, [OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling%5BTitle%5D), " Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein RBP and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold
3. __abiotic stress__, [OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses
4. __abiotic stress__, [OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling%5BTitle%5D), OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling"
