* **Key message**  
    + OsDEG10 RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants
    + Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold
    + Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses
    + OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling
