    + Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance.
    + Here, we report that two alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice (Oryza sativa) LAMMER kinase gene OsDR11, long OsDR11L and short OsDR11S, play opposite roles in rice resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide.
    + These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in rice disease resistance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling.
