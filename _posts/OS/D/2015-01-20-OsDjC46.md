* **Key message**  
    + Here, various stimuli, such as abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxidase (H(2)O(2)), polyethylene (PEG) and sodium chloride (NaCl) markedly induced the expression of OsDjC46 in the seedlings
    + Heat shock protein has been shown to increase plant resistance to stresses, but whether OsDjC46 was a key factor in plant response to various stresses has not been reported
    + A J-Protein OsDjC46 Interacts with ZFP36 to Participate in ABA-Mediated Antioxidant Defense in Rice.
    + Taken together, these findings reveal a novel function of OsDjC46 in adjusting ABA-induced antioxidant defense
    + Overexpression of OsDjC46 in rice can enhance the tolerance to salinity and drought; in contrast, knockout of OsDjC46 rice plants was more sensitive to salt stress and drought
    + Further investigation revealed that OsDjC46 could participate in regulating the expression and activities of antioxidant of SOD and CAT under drought and salt stress
