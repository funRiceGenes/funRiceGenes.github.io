* **Key message**  
    + Whereas Arabidopsis drm1 drm2 double mutants showed no morphological alterations, targeted disruptants of rice OsDRM2 displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes in both vegetative and reproductive stages, including growth defects, semi-dwarfed stature, reductions in tiller number, delayed heading or no heading, abnormal panicle and spikelet morphology, and complete sterility
    + Our results suggest that OsDRM2 is responsible for de novo, CG and non-CG methylation in rice genomic sequences, and that DNA methylation regulated by OsDRM2 is essential for proper rice development in both vegetative and reproductive stages
    + Impaired growth and abnormal DNA methylation of osdrm2 disruptants were restored by the complementation of wild-type OsDRM2 cDNA
    + Targeted disruption of an orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 2, OsDRM2, impairs the growth of rice plants by abnormal DNA methylation
