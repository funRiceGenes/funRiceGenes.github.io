* **Key message**  
    + The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells
    + Key genes associated with maintaining DNA methylation in rice were analyzed by RT-qPCR and indicated that OsDMT702 might be responsible for the global increase of DNA methylation level in rice under RBSDV stress
