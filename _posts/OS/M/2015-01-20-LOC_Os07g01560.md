* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root
    + 6% identity with the rice monosaccharide transporter OsMST3
    + These results suggested that OsMST3 is involved in the accumulation of monosaccharides required for cell wall synthesis at the stage of cell thickening
