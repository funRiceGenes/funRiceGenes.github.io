* **Key message**  
    + OsMAPKKK63 is involved in salt stress response and seed dormancy control.
    + The result suggests that OsMAPKKK63 may also be involved in seed dormancy control
    + OsMAPKKK63 was found to be induced by several abiotic stresses, including high salinity, chilling and drought
    + The two rice MKKs are known mediator of the salt stress response, implying that OsMAPKKK63 may be involved in the high salinity response
    + Our analysis of an OsMAPKKK63 knockout mutant indeed demonstrated that it is necessary for normal response to high salt
    + Our data indicate that OsMAPKKK63 possesses in vitro kinase activity and that it interacts with rice MAP kinase kinase OsMKK1 and OsMKK6
