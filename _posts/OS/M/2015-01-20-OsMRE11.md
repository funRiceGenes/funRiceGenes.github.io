## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis
2. __meiotic__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation
3. __meiotic__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene
4. __seed__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
5. __growth__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
6. __vegetative__, [MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
