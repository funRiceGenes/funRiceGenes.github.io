* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis
    + Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation
    + We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene
    + The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed

* **Connection**  
    + __OsDMC1~DMC1B__, __OsMRE11__, [OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D), In the absence of OsDMC1, early recombination events probably occur normally, leading to normal localization of γH2AX, PAIR3, OsMRE11, OsCOM1 and OsRAD51C
