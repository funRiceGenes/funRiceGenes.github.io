## Expression information

## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Transcriptional Regulation of a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene, OsMAPK4, in Response to Environmental Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcriptional Regulation of a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene, OsMAPK4, in Response to Environmental Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  OsMAPK4 transcripts were expressed strongly in mature leaves and weakly in young leaves and panicles
2. __salinity__, ["Transcriptional Regulation of a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene, OsMAPK4, in Response to Environmental Stresses"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="Transcriptional Regulation of a Rice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene, OsMAPK4, in Response to Environmental Stresses"%5BTitle%5D), " In addition, the mRNA level of OsMAPK4 was up-regulated under sugar starvation, high salinity and cold treatments"
