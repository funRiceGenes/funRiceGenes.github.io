* **Key message**  
    + OsMSI1 was ubiquitously expressed and appears to be essential for development in rice, as the mutation of OsMSI1 was lethal
    + These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice
    + Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral de-velopment in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2
