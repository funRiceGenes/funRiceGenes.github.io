## Key message
1. __seedling__, [A novel rice MAPK gene, OsBIMK2, is involved in disease-resistance responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel rice MAPK gene, OsBIMK2, is involved in disease-resistance responses%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsBIMK2 was also up-regulated during early stage after inoculation with MAGNAPORTHE GRISEA in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during an incompatible interaction between M
2. __disease resistance__, [A novel rice MAPK gene, OsBIMK2, is involved in disease-resistance responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel rice MAPK gene, OsBIMK2, is involved in disease-resistance responses%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OSBIMK2 was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice
