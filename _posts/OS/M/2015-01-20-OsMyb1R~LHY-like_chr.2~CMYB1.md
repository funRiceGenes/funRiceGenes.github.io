* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, CMYB1 probably also plays a role in modulating cell cycle in rice stem and node and involves the internodes elongation.
    + Based on the subcellular localization and transcription activation activity, it could be confirmed that CMYB1 functions as a transcription activator in rice cells.
