* **Key message**  
    + Expression silencing of OsMAPK20-5 (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) following gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs
    + Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice plants to planthoppers, it also enables rice plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense response-related autotoxicity
