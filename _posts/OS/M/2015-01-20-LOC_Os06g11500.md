* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
    + Likewise, the OsMCM2 protein was ubiquitously expressed, but it was downregulated when nutritients were limiting, indicating that MCM2 expression (and therefore cell cycle progression) requires adequate nutrition
