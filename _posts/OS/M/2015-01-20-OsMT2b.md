* **Key message**  
    + In contrast with wild-type plants, OsMT2b-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had serious handicap in plant growth and root formation, whereas OsMT2b-overexpressing transformants were dwarfed and presented more adventitious roots and big lateral roots
    + Taken together, these results indicate a possible feedback regulation mechanism of OsMT2b to the level of endogenous cytokinins that is involved in root development and seed embryo germination of rice
    + Characteristic and expression analysis of a metallothionein gene, OsMT2b, down-regulated by cytokinin suggests functions in root development and seed embryo germination of rice
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMT2b showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus
    + Histochemical staining analysis of transgenic rice carrying OsMT2b::GUS chimeric gene showed that high-level GUS activity was detected in germinated embryos and at the meristematic part of other tissues during germination
    + OsMT2b was preferentially expressed in rice immature panicles, scutellum of germinating embryos, and primordium of lateral roots
    + A rice subfamily p2 (type 2) MT gene, OsMT2b, has been shown previously to exhibit the most abundant gene expression in young rice seedling
    + We found that the OsMT2b gene is strongly and differentially expressed in germinated rice embryos during seed germination and seedling development
    + We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors
    + Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) METALLOTHIONEIN2b (OsMT2b) molecularly and found that its expression was down-regulated by cytokinins
    + Expression of OsMT2b was found to be regulated negatively by ethylene and hydrogen peroxide in rice stem node under flooding stress, but little is known about its response to sugar depletion
    + Identification of sugar response complex in the metallothionein OsMT2b gene promoter for enhancement of foreign protein production in transgenic rice.
    + A 146-bp sugar response complex MTSRC is identified in the promoter of rice metallothionein OsMT2b gene conferring high-level expression of luciferase reporter gene and bioactive recombinant haFGF in transgenic rice
    + We found that the expression of OsMT2b gene is induced by sugar starvation in both rice suspension cells and germinated embryos
    + Deletion analysis and functional assay of the OsMT2b promoter revealed that the 5'-flanking region of the OsMT2b between nucleotides -<U+2009>351 and -<U+2009>121, which contains the sugar response complex (-<U+2009>266 to -<U+2009>121, designated MTSRC) is responsible for high-level promoter activity under sugar starvation
