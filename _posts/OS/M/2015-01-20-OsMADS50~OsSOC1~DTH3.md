* **Key message**  
    + RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
    + These results suggest that OsMADS50 is an important flowering activator that controls various floral regulators in rice
    + We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering
    + Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering phenotype only under LD conditions
    + These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
    + OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice
    + In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering
    + OsSOC1 is expressed in vegetative tissues, and expression is elevated at the time of floral initiation, 40-50 days after sowing, and remains uniformly high thereafter, similar to the expression pattern of AtSOC1
    + Among them, the OsMADS50 and Heading date1 pathways were not affected by the mutation
    + By analyzing a large F2 population from NIL x DJY1, the locus DTH3 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 3) controlling early heading date in DJY1 was fine mapped to a 64-kb segment which contained only one annotated gene, a MIKC-type MADS-box protein
    + The Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) which promotes the RFT1, was up-regulated by DTH3 in both LD and SD conditions
    + Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1
    + In a screen for MADS box genes which activate and/or repress flowering in rice, we identified a gene encoding a MADS domain protein (OsSOC1) related to the Arabidopsis gene AtSOC1
    + The constitutive expression of OsSOC1 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering, suggesting that the rice gene is a functional equivalent of AtSOC1
    + We were not able to identify FLC-like sequences in the rice genome; however, we show that ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis FLC delays flowering in rice, and the up-regulation of OsSOC1 at the onset of flowering initiation is delayed in the AtFLC transgenic lines
    + Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice
    + Furthermore, mutants in OsMADS50, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis SUPPRESOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) did not flower up to 300 days after sowing under LD conditions, indicating that OsMADS50, which acts upstream of RFT1, promotes flowering under LD conditions
    + We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice
    + The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change
    + OsSOC1 is located on top of the short arm of chromosome 3, tightly linked to the heading date locus, Hd9
    + We detected a 6-bp deletion and a single base substitution in the C-domain by sequencing DTH3 in DJY1 compared with dth3 in NIL, and overexpression of DTH3 caused early flowering in callus
    + DTH3 affected flowering time and had no significant effect on the main agronomic traits
    + Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice
    + While overexpression of OsMADS50 caused extremely early flowering at the callus stage, OsMADS50 RNAi plants exhibited phenotypes of late flowering and an increase in the number of elongated internodes

    + __BRD2~DIM~DWF1~LHDD10~LTBSG1__, __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, [Brassinosteroid BR biosynthetic gene lhdd10 controls late heading and plant height in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Brassinosteroid BR biosynthetic gene lhdd10 controls late heading and plant height in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D), Our data showed that lhdd10 influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions
    + __Hd18__, __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, [Hd18, encoding histone acetylase related to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D, is involved in the control of flowering time in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hd18, encoding histone acetylase related to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D, is involved in the control of flowering time in rice.%5BTitle%5D), We revealed that Hd18 acts as an accelerator in the rice-flowering pathway under both short- and long-day conditions by elevating transcription levels of Ehd1 Gene expression analysis also suggested the involvement of MADS-box genes such as OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 in the Hd18-associated regulation of Ehd1 These results suggest that, like FLD, its rice homolog accelerates flowering time but is involved in rice flowering pathways that differ from the autonomous pathways in Arabidopsis
    + __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, __OsMADS7~OsMADS45__, [Ectopic expression of OsMADS45 activates the upstream genes Hd3a and RFT1 at an early development stage causing early flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ectopic expression of OsMADS45 activates the upstream genes Hd3a and RFT1 at an early development stage causing early flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsMADS45 overexpression did not influence other floral regulator genes upstream of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsGI (OsGIGANTEA), Ehd2/Osld1/RID1 and OsMADS50
    + __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, __OsSPL3__, [OsSPL3, a SBP-Domain Protein, Regulates Crown Root Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSPL3, a SBP-Domain Protein, Regulates Crown Root Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of OsSPL3-binding sites and RNA-sequencing of differentially expressed transcripts in lcrn1 further identified potential direct targets of OsSPL3 in basal nodes, including a MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS50
    + __Ef-cd__, __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, [Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.%5BTitle%5D),  The Ef-cd locus gives rise to a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense transcript overlapping the OsSOC1 gene
    + __Ef-cd__, __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, [Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.%5BTitle%5D),  Ef-cd lncRNA expression positively correlates with the expression of OsSOC1 and H3K36me3 deposition
