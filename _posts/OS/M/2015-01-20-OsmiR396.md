    + SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.
    + The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation
    + Here we show that sequestering OsmiR396 through target mimicry (MIM396) can substantially increase grain size in several japonica and indica rice subspecies and in plants with excessive tillers and a high panicle density
    + Thus, OsmiR396 has a major role related to the regulation of rice grain size
    + Our findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size
