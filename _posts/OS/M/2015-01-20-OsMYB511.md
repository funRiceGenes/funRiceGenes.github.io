* **Key message**  
    + In the present research, a full-length MYB gene OsMYB511 was identified from rice seedlings through microarray data
    + Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that OsMYB511 was highly expressed in rice panicles at earlier development stage
    + Induction of OsMYB511 by cold stress was dramatic in japonica cultivar Jiucaiqing as compared to indica IR26
    + OsMYB511 encodes a MYB domain transcription activator early regulated by abiotic stress in rice.
    + The subcellular localization and yeast hybrid assay suggested that OsMYB511 is nucleus-localized transcription activator
