    + Overexpression of OsMYB305 in Rice Enhances the Nitrogen Uptake Under Low-Nitrogen Condition.
    + Here, we characterized the roles of the MYB transcription factor OsMYB305 in nitrogen uptake and assimilation in rice
    + OsMYB305 encoded a transcriptional activator and its expression was induced by N deficiency in rice root
    + Our results revealed that OsMYB305 overexpression suppressed cellulose biosynthesis under low-nitrogen condition, thereby freeing up carbohydrate for nitrate uptake and assimilation and enhancing rice growth
    + Under low-N condition, OsMYB305 overexpression significantly increased the tiller number, shoot dry weight and total N concentration
