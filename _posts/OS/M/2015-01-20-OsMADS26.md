* **Key message**  
    + Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots
    + Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants
    + OsMADS26 negatively regulates resistance to pathogens and drought tolerance in rice
    + Over-expression of the OsMADS26 gene in rice (Oryza sativa) has revealed a possible function related to stress response
