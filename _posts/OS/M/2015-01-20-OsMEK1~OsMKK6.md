* **Key message**  
    + Subtractive screening of cDNA that accumulated in 12 degrees C-treated anthers identified a cDNA clone, OsMEK1, encoding a protein with features characteristic of a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase
    + OsMEK1 transcript levels were induced in rice anthers by 12 degrees C treatment for 48 h
    + Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress
    + Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice
    + Taken together, our data suggest that OsMKK6 and OsMPK3 constitute a moderately low-temperature signalling pathway and regulate cold stress tolerance in rice
    + In the present study, a MKK from rice (Oryza sativa), OsMKK6 was functionally characterized in salt stress by transforming its constitutively active form
    + CONCLUSION: Present work suggest role of OsMKK6 gene in salt stress signaling in rice
    + Similar OsMEK1 induction was observed in shoots and roots of seedlings that were treated at 12 degrees C for up to 24 h
    + It is interesting that no induction of OsMEK1 transcripts was observed in 4 degrees C-treated seedlings
    + Enhanced chilling tolerance was observed in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsMKK6DD
    + Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice
