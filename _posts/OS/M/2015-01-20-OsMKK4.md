* **Key message**  
    + Further results revealed that OsMKK4 influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression of BR-related genes
    + Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots
    + Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
    + Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice
    + Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
