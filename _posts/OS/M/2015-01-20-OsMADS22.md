## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 led to abnormal floral morphologies including leaf-like sepals, whereas only OsMADS55 expression caused delayed flowering via downregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1)
2. __spikelet meristem__, [OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy%5BTitle%5D)), OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy
3. __flowering time__, [Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMADS55, but not OsMADS22, complemented the early flowering phenotype and ambient temperature-insensitive flowering phenotype seen in svp mutants, suggesting that OsMADS55 regulates flowering time associated with ambient temperature responses in Arabidopsis
