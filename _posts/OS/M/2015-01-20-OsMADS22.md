* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 led to abnormal floral morphologies including leaf-like sepals, whereas only OsMADS55 expression caused delayed flowering via downregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1)
    + OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy
    + Overexpression of OsMADS55, but not OsMADS22, complemented the early flowering phenotype and ambient temperature-insensitive flowering phenotype seen in svp mutants, suggesting that OsMADS55 regulates flowering time associated with ambient temperature responses in Arabidopsis
    + In contrast to previously reported STMADS11-like genes, whose expression is detected in vegetative tissues, OsMADS22 is mainly expressed during embryogenesis and flower development
    + Ectopic expression of OsMADS22 in transgenic rice plants resulted in aberrant floral morphogenesis, characterized by a disorganized palea, an elongated glume, and a two-floret spikelet
    + In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsMADS22 expression is localized in the L1 layer of embryos and in developing stamen primordia
