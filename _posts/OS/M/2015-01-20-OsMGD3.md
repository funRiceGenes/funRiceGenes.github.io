* **Key message**  
    + We showed that plant phosphate (Pi) status and transcription factor OsPHR2 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of OsMGD3
    + Further, OsMGD3 showed a predominant role in roots, altering lateral root growth
    + CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) lines of OsMGD3 were generated to explore its potential role in rice adaptation to Pi deficiency
    + Compared to WT, OsMGD3 KO lines displayed a reduction while OE lines showed an enhanced, Pi acquisition and utilization
    + Our comprehensive lipidomic analysis revealed the role of OsMGD3 in membrane lipid remodeling in addition to a role in regulating diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid levels that affected the expression of Pi transporters
