* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot analysis showed that accumulation of OsMT-II-1a mRNA is specifically abundant in developing seeds and 2-day glumes after pollination, and OsMT-II-1a transcription can markedly be induced by H2O2, paraquat, SNP, ethephon, ABA and SA, but barely by metal ions or other exogenous abiotic factors such as low temperature and PEG
    + Taken together, the above results suggest that the processes of pollination and seed development might be mediated, at least in part, by expression of the OsMT-II-1a gene that is regulated by several abiotic factors
