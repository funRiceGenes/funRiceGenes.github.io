* **Key message**  
    + The genetic effect of SG3 on grain length was dependent on GS3 status
    + SG3 overexpression and knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length
    + The isolation of the SG3 MYB gene provides new gene resource and contributes to the regulatory network of grain length in rice
    + SG3 and GS3 were frequently in coupling phase in indica rice, making them good targets for the breeding of cultivars with short or long grains
    + A gene encoding an R2R3 MYB domain transcriptional regulator was identified as the candidate gene for SG3
    + SG3 was preferentially expressed in panicles after flowering, and SG3 acted as a transcription activator
