* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMsr9 in Arabidopsis and rice showed enhanced salt stress tolerance displaying increased shoot and root elongation, higher survival rates in transgenic plants compared with wild type
    + In a previous study, it has been shown that OsMsr9 was induced by cold, drought and heat stresses
    + Here, we report that OsMsr9 plays roles in salt tolerance in plants
    + Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that OsMsr9 was also rapidly and strongly induced by salt stress
    + OsMsr9 might act as a positive regulator of plant salt tolerance with reinforced expression of stress-related genes, such as RD29A, DREB2A and RAB18 in transgenic plants under salt conditions
    + These results indicate that OsMsr9 could be a useful gene in developing transgenic crops with enhanced salt tolerance
    + OsFBX257 expression level modulates root architecture and drought stress tolerance in rice
    + OsFBX257 knockdown (OsFBX257(KD) ) lines show reduced total root length and depth, crown root number, panicle size and survival under stress
    + Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.
    + OsFBX257 is a promising breeding target for alleviating drought stress-induced damage in rice
    + OsFBX257 is co-expressed in a network involving protein kinases and phosphatases
    + We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases OsCDPK1 and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08
