* **Key message**  
    + Using comparative interactomics, we isolated two OsBAG4-interacting proteins, OsMYB106 (a MYB transcription factor) and OsSUVH7 (a DNA methylation reader), that were crucial for OsHKT1;5 expression
    + Elimination of the MITE or knockout of OsMYB106 or OsSUVH7 decreased OsHKT1;5 expression and increased salt sensitivity
    + Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5
