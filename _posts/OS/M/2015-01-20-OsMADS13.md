* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, making carpels inside carpels, the osmads13 flower is indeterminate, showing that OsMADS13 also has a function in floral meristem determinacy
    + Here, we report the interactions of rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic genes, OsMADS3 (a C-class gene), OsMADS13 (a D-class gene), and DROOPING LEAF (DL), in specifying floral organ identities and floral meristem determinacy
    + osmads13-3 osmads3-4 displayed a loss of floral meristem determinacy and generated abundant carpelloid structures containing severe defective ovules in the flower center, which were not detectable in the single mutant
    + This indicates that OsMADS3 plays a synergistic role with OsMADS13 in both ovule development and floral meristem termination
    + These observations suggest that DL and OsMADS13 may function in the same pathway specifying the identity of carpel/ovule and floral meristem
    + Genetic interaction of OsMADS3, DROOPING LEAF, and OsMADS13 in specifying rice floral organ identities and meristem determinacy
    + Furthermore, the defects of osmads13-3 dl-sup6 flowers appeared identical to those of dl-sup6, and the OsMADS13 expression was undetectable in dl-sup6 flowers
    + Collectively, we propose a model to illustrate the role of OsMADS3, DL, and OsMADS13 in the specification of flower organ identity and meristem determinacy in rice
    + Our results suggest that OsMADS13 is the ortholog of ZAG2 and ZMM1 and might play a role in rice ovule and seed development
    + We show that the osmads13 mutant is female sterile and that ovules are converted into carpelloid structures
    + Expression studies and preliminary analyses of two upregulated Zinc-finger transcription factor encoding genes indicate that our dataset represents a valuable resource for the identification of both OsMADS13 target genes and novel players in rice ovule development
    + Transcriptome analysis reveals rice OsMADS13 as an important repressor of the carpel development pathway in ovules
    + Taken together, our study suggests that OsMADS13 is an important repressor of the carpel pathway during ovule development
    + In rice, the AG subfamily gene OsMADS13 is intimately involved in the determination of ovule identity, since knock-out mutant plants develop carpel-like structures in place of ovules resulting in female sterility
