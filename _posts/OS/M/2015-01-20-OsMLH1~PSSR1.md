* **Key message**  
    + OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL<a6><c3>) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency
    + OsMLH1 interacts with OsMLH3 to regulate synapsis and interference-sensitive crossover formation during meiosis in rice
    + Here, we report the identification of OsMLH1 and reveal its functions during meiosis in rice
    + A retrotransposon insertion in MUTL-HOMOLOG 1 affects wild rice seed set and cultivated rice crossover rate
