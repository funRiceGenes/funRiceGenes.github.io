* **Key message**  
    + By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
    + OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress
    + Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
    + Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed that OsMKK1 targeted OsMPK4
    + Further analyses revealed that OsDMI3-mediated phosphorylation of OsMKK1 positively regulates ABA responses in seed germination, root growth, and tolerance to both water stress and oxidative stress
    + The activation of OsMKK1 and its downstream kinase OsMPK1 is dependent on Thr-25 phosphorylation of OsMKK1 in ABA signaling
    + Our results indicate that OsMKK1 is a direct target of OsDMI3, and OsDMI3-mediated phosphorylation of OsMKK1 plays an important role in activating the MAPK cascade and ABA signaling
    + These combined results suggest that OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 expression positively regulates iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death, and blast disease (susceptibility)-related cell death was ROS-dependent but iron-independent in rice-M
