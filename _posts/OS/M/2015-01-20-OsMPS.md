1. __salt__, ["MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways"%5BTitle%5D),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
2. __biomass__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D),  Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass
3. __reproductive__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
4. __phytohormone__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D),  Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN EXP and cell-wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes
5. __phytohormone__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D),  The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth
6. __cytokinin__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D),  OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide

8. __vegetative__, [MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways%5BTitle%5D),  OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
