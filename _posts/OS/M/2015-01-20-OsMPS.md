* **Key message**  
    + OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues
    + Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass
    + Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN (EXP) and cell-wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes
    + The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth
    + OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide
    + Furthermore, the expression of OsMPS-dependent genes is regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid
    + Here, the role of MULTIPASS (OsMPS), an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor of rice, was explored
    + Growth retardation caused by OsMPS over-expression is partially restored by auxin application
