* **Key message**  
    + Downregulation of TL by RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression of OsMYB60 resulted in twisted leaf blades in transgenic rice
    + This suggests that TL may play a cis-regulatory role on OsMYB60 in leaf morphological development
    + We further discovered that a C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, is an OsMYB60 binding partner and involved in leaf development
    + Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR showed that the loss-of-function of OsMYB60 led to downregulation of wax biosynthetic genes, leading to reduced amounts of total wax components on leaf surfaces under normal conditions
    + Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsMYB60 contributes to enhancing rice resilience to drought stress by promoting cuticular wax biosynthesis on leaf surfaces
    + Here, we show that the MYB transcription factor OsMYB60 positively regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis and this helps rice (Oryza sativa) plants tolerate drought stress
    + Mutation of OsMYB60 reduces rice resilience to drought stress by attenuating cuticular wax biosynthesis.
    + Compared with the wild type (japonica cultivar &#x27;Dongjin&#x27;), osmyb60 null mutants (osmyb60-1 and osmyb60-2) exhibited increased drought sensitivity, with higher chlorophyll leaching and faster rates of water loss

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCER1~OsGL1-4~LTR1__, __OsMYB60__, [Mutation of OsMYB60 reduces rice resilience to drought stress by attenuating cuticular wax biosynthesis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of OsMYB60 reduces rice resilience to drought stress by attenuating cuticular wax biosynthesis.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast one-hybrid, luciferase transient transcriptional activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsMYB60 directly binds to the promoter of OsCER1 (a key gene involved in very-long-chain alkane biosynthesis) and upregulates its expression
