* **Key message**  
    + This paper presents evidence that OsMAPK2 (Oryza sativa MAP kinase gene 2) is responsive to Pi deficiency and involved in Pi homeostasis
    + Our results indicated that OsMAPK2 enables tolerance phosphate deficiency and is involved in Pi homeostasis
    + In suspension-cultured cells, the OsMAPK2 mRNA transcript increased markedly upon temperature downshift from 26degreesC to 4degreesC and sucrose starvation
    + In contrast, the OsMAPK2 mRNA level rapidly declined in rice cell challenged by high temperature
    + These results suggest that OsBIMK1 plays an important role in rice disease resistance
    + OsBIMK1, a rice MAP kinase gene involved in disease resistance responses
    + Present results demonstrating dramatic transcriptional and transient regulation of the OsMSRMK2 expression by diverse biotic/abiotic stresses, a first report for any rice (or plant) MAPK to date, suggest a role for OsMSRMK2 in rice defense/stress response pathways
    + Using in vitro system, we show that the expression of OsMSRMK2 mRNA was potently enhanced within 15 min by signalling molecules, protein phosphatase inhibitors, ultraviolet irradiation, fungal elicitor, heavy metals, high salt and sucrose, and drought
    + We found that full-length expression of OsMAPK2 was up-regulated in both rice plants and cell culture in the absence of inorganic phosphate (Pi)
    + Overexpression of OsMAPK2 Enhances Low Phosphate Tolerance in Rice and Arabidopsis thaliana
    + By contrast, overexpression lines exhibited increased OsMAPK5 kinase activity and increased tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stresses
    + Expression of OsBIMK1 was activated rapidly upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH) as well as with dichloroisonicotinic acid, probenazole, jasmonic acid and its methyl ester, Pseudomonas syringae pv
    + These results strongly suggest that OsMAPK5 can positively regulate drought, salt, and cold tolerance and negatively modulate PR gene expression and broad-spectrum disease resistance
    + The transgenic rice and Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsMAPK2 showed affected root development and increased plant Pi content compared with wild-type plants
    + OsMSRMK2 expression was further modulated by co-application of JA, salicylic acid, and ethylene and required de novo synthesized protein factor(s) in its transient regulation
    + Nipponbare) C(2) H(2) -type ZFP ZFP182 in ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the relationship between ZFP182 and two rice MAPKs, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 in ABA signaling were investigated
    + Nipponbare), we identified a single copy gene called OsMSRMK2 from jasmonic acid (JA) treated rice seedling leaf cDNA library
    + Overexpression of OsMAPK2 controlled the expression of several Pi starvation-responsive genes
    + Analysis at the mRNA level has shown that OsMAPK2 is expressed in all plant organs and high relative amounts of OsMAPK2 were detected in the mature panicles in comparison with in the immature panicles
    + These results suggest that this OsMAPK2 may function in the stress-signalling pathway as well as panicle development in rice
    + The OsMAPK2 gene has been found to function in plant tolerance to diverse biotic/abiotic stresses
    + A similarly rapid response of OsMAPK2 was observed in stress-treated seedlings, demonstrating that response of the MAPK pathway occurs also in intact plants
    + The OsMAPK5 gene, its protein, and kinase activity were inducible by abscisic acid as well as various biotic (pathogen infection) and abiotic (wounding, drought, salt, and cold) stresses
    + Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress
    + Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice
    + Moreover, high (37 degrees C) and low temperatures (12 degrees C) and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide-differentially regulate the OsMSRMK2 mRNA accumulation in leaves of intact plants
    + ABA treatment induced the increases in the expression of ZFP182, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in rice leaves
    + Besides, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 were shown to be required for the up-regulation in the expression of ZFP182 in ABA signaling, but ZFP182 did not mediate the ABA-induced up-regulation in the expression of OsMPK1 and OsMPK5
    + primes) the transcription, accumulation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK3 as well as the expression of the downstream WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY70 and several jasmonate biosynthesis genes, resulting in a higher accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA)
    + Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that OsMPK3 is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance
    + It was observed that OsMPK6 overexpression lines had a more robust and spread out root architectural system while OsMPK3 overexpression lines had a typical bushy phenotype
