* **Key message**  
    + In addition, transcription factor OsLFL1 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of OsMFT1 via an RY motif and activate the expression of OsMFT1 in vivo and in vitro
    + OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.
    + Overexpressing OsMFT1 delayed heading date by over 7 d and greatly increased spikelets per panicle and the number of branches
    + In contrast, OsMFT1 knockout mutants had an advanced heading date and reduced spikelets per panicle
    + RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsMFT1 repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced
    + Therefore, OsMFT1 is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture
    + OsMFT1 was found to interact with two key drought-related transcription factors, OsbZIP66 and OsMYB26, and regulates their binding capacity on drought-related genes, thus enhancing drought tolerance in rice
    + Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice
    + These results demonstrate that dynamic modulation of drought responsive genes by OsMFT1-OsMYB26 complex and OsMFT1-OsbZIP66 complex is integral to OsFTIP1 effect on impeding nuclear translocation of OsMFT1
    + Our findings suggest that OsMFT1 acts as a hitherto unknown nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signal that regulates drought tolerance in rice in response to environmental signals
    + OsMFT1 inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.
    + Overexpression of OsMFT1 (OsMFT1OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination
    + Transcriptome comparisons of osmft1 vs WT in the absence and presence of salt stress yielded several differentially expressed genes, which were associated with salt stress, plant hormone metabolism, and signaling pathways, such as B-BOX ZINC FINGER 6, Oryza sativa bZIP PROTEIN 8, and GIBBERELLIN (GA) 20-oxidase 1
    + In addition, the sensitivity of OsMFT1OE seeds to GA and osmft1 seeds to ABA during seed germination increased under salt stress
    + In this study, we found that seeds of loss-of-function osmft1 mutants germinated faster than wild-type (WT) seeds under salt stress, but this was not the case for loss-of-function osmft2 mutants
