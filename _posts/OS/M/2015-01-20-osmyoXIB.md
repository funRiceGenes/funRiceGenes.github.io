* **Key message**  
    + Under both SD and LD conditions, the OSMYOXIB transcript was detected in whole anthers
    + However, under SD conditions, the OSMYOXIB-GUS fusion protein was localized only in the epidermal layer of anthers due to the lack of 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and to dilute (DIL) domain sequences following the Ds insertion
