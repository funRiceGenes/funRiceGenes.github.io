* **Key message**  
    + The up-regulation of the OsMBTB32 transcript in 2-week-old seedlings under salt stress suggests the significant role of the OsMBTB32 gene in salinity
    + The OsMBTB32 transgenic seedlings (OE and RNAi) exhibited significant differences in various phenotypes, including plumule, radical, primary root, and shoot length, compared to WT seedlings
    + Here, we found a novel MATH-BTB domain-containing OsMBTB32 protein that was highly expressed in leaf, root, and shoot
    + We further found that OsCUL1 proteins, particularly OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3, interact with OsMBTB32 and may suppress the function of OsMBTB32 during salt stress
    + Moreover, OsWRKY42, a homolog of ZmWRKY114 which negatively regulates salt stress in rice, directly binds to the W-box of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 promoters to promote the interaction of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-3 with OsMBTB32 protein in rice
    + The overexpression of OsMBTB32 and OsCUL1-3 further confirmed the function of OsMBTB32 and OsCUL1s in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis
