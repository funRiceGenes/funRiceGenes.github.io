## Key message
1. __seed development__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
2. __flower__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2 andOsMST5Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5 and their corresponding cDNAs
3. __grain__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2 andOsMST5Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5 and their corresponding cDNAs
4. __seed__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
5. __transporter__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D), cDNA of a monosaccharide transporter in rice, OsMST5 Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporter 5 was cloned and its sugar transport activity was characterized by heterologous expression analysis
6. __transporter__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D), Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5
7. __transporter__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2 andOsMST5Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5 and their corresponding cDNAs
8. __pollen__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D),  Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice
9. __panicle__, [Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5%5BTitle%5D),  Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice
10. __panicle__, [Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Sugar transporters involved in flowering and grain development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination
