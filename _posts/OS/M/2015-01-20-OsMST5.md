* **Key message**  
    + These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development
    + To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs
    + cDNA of a monosaccharide transporter in rice, OsMST5 (Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporter 5) was cloned and its sugar transport activity was characterized by heterologous expression analysis
    + Characterization of Rice Functional Monosaccharide Transporter,OsMST5
    + Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice
    + Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination
