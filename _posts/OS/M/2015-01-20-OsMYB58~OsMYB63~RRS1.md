* **Key message**  
    + RRS1 shapes robust root system to enhance drought resistance in rice.
    + RRS1 knockout plants showed enhanced root growth, including longer root length, longer lateral root length, and larger lateral root density
    + RRS1 represses root development by directly activating the expression of OsIAA3 which is involved in the auxin signaling pathway
    + Knockout of RRS1 enhances drought resistance by promoting water absorption and improving water use efficiency
