* **Key message**  
    + An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers
    + OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering
    + Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
    + Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
    + The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
    + Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
