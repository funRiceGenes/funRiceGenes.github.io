* **Key message**  
    + An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers
    + OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering
    + Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
    + Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
    + The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14
    + Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
    + Here, we demonstrate that interacting transcription factors OsMADS57 and OsTB1 directly target the defense gene OsWRKY94 and the organogenesis gene D14 to trade off the functions controlling/moderating rice tolerance to cold
    + However, D14 transcription was directly promoted by OsMADS57 for suppressing tillering under the chilling treatment, whereas D14 was repressed for enhancing tillering under normal condition
    + Overexpression of OsMADS57 maintains rice tiller growth under chilling stress
    + OsMADS57 together with OsTB1 coordinates transcription of its target OsWRKY94 and D14 to switch its organogenesis to defense for cold adaptation in rice.
    + We demonstrated that OsMADS57 and OsTB1 conversely affect rice chilling tolerance via targeting OsWRKY94
    + OsMADS57 binds directly to the promoter of OsWRKY94, activating its transcription for the cold stress response, while suppressing its activity under normal temperatures
    + OsMADS57 is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate
    + 2 mM nitrate, osmads57 mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels
    + Rapid NO3- root influx experiments showed that mutation of OsMADS57 did not affect root nitrate uptake
    + Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in osmads57 mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root tips of mutant plants
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2
    + 3a functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between OsMADS57 and OsNRT2
    + Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.
    + These results indicated that OsMADS57 acts as an important transcriptional regulator that regulates stem elongation and panicle exsertion in rice via GA-mediated regulatory pathway
    + Here we investigated the functions of OsMADS57 in plant vegetative growth in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Knockdown of OsMADS57 reduced the plant height, internode elongation and panicle exsertion in rice plants
    + Moreover, OsMADS57 knockdown plants were more sensitive to gibberellic acid (GA3), and contained less bioactive GA3 than wild-type plants, which implied that OsMADS57 is involved in gibberellin (GA) pathway
    + The level of EUI1 transcripts involved in GA deactivation was also increased in OsMADS57 knockdown plants
    + In addition, OsMADS57 also modulated the expression of multiple genes involved in GA metabolism or GA signaling pathway, indicating the key and complex regulatory role of OsMADS57 in GA pathway in rice
