* **Key message**  
    + A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
    + We also generated and characterized OsMCA1-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; OsMCA1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while OsMCA1-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels
    + A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice
    + Our results revealed the pad is a loss-of-function mutant of the OsMCA1/PAD, leading to upregulation of genes related to GA deactivation, which decreased bioactive GA levels.
    + PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae.
    + Plasma Membrane Ca2+ Permeable Mechanosensitive Channel OsDMT1 Is Involved in Regulation of Plant Architecture and Ion Homeostasis in Rice.
    + Here, we isolated and characterized a T-DNA insertion rice mutant Osdmt1 (Oryza sativa dwarf and multi-tillering1) that exhibited a severe dwarf phenotype and multi-tillering
