## Key message
1. __submergence__, [OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), " OsMTN transcripts and OsMTN-specific activity increased slowly and in parallel upon submergence, indicating that regulation occurred mainly at the transcriptional level
