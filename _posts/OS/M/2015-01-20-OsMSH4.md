    + Crossover Formation During Rice Meiosis Relies on Interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5
    + The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs).
    + Cytological analysis showed that developments of both pollen and embryo sacs in an Osmsh4 mutant were blocked due to defective chromosome pairing
