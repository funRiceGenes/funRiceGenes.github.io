* **Key message**  
    + Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance
    + The OsMATE2 upon constitutive expression in tobacco decreases root-to-shoot As transfer coefficient and its endosperm-specific silencing in rice reduces grain As content, broadening the role of MATE proteins in planta
    + Transgenic rice lines demonstrated significant reduction of both OsMATE2 transcript (~<U+2009>38-87%) and grain As content (36
    + 6%) along with augmented As sensitivity by increasing oxidative stress compared to untransformed control plants, indicating the involvement of OsMATE2 in As accumulation
