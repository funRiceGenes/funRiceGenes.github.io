* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD
    + These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
    + OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice
