* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD
    + These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
    + OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice
    + 8, OsMADS56 encoding a MADS-box transcription factor, was performed in this study
    + In these populations, decreased grain weight and size were associated with a reduction in the expression of OsMADS56
    + In transgenic populations of OsMADS56 driven by a strong constitutive promoter, grain weight and size of the positive plants were significantly higher than those of the negative plants
    + Cloning of OsMADS56 provides a new gene resource to improve grain weight and size through molecular design breeding
    + Control of Thousand-Grain Weight by OsMADS56 in Rice.
