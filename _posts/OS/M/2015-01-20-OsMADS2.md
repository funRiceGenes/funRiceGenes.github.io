* **Key message**  
    + We ascribe a function for OsMADS2 in controlling cell division and differentiation along the proximal-distal axis
    + The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4
    + OsMADS2 is required to trigger parenchymatous and lodicule-specific vascular development while maintaining a small organ size
    + Our data implicate the developmentally late spatially restricted accumulation of OsMADS2 transcripts in the differentiating lodicule to control growth of these regions
    + Grasses have duplicated PI/GLO-like genes and in rice (Oryza sativa) one these genes, OsMADS2, controls lodicule formation without affecting stamen development
    + Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning
    + Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development
    + Lodicule identity and development are specified by the action of protein complexes involving the SPW1 and OsMADS2 transcription factors
