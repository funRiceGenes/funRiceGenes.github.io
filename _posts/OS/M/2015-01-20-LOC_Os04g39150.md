* **Key message**  
    + OsMLP423 Is a Positive Regulator of Tolerance to Drought and Salt Stresses in Rice.
    + The results of real-time PCR showed that OsMLP423 was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses
    + The physiological and biochemical phenotype analysis of transgenic plants confirmed that overexpression of OsMLP423 enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stresses in rice
    + Physiological analyses showed that the overexpression of OsMLP423 may regulate the water loss efficiency and ABA-responsive gene expression of rice plants under drought and salt stresses, and it reduces membrane damage and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
    + These results indicate that OsMLP423 is a positive regulator of drought and salinity tolerance in rice, governing the tolerance of rice to abiotic stresses through an ABA-dependent pathway
    + The expression of OsMLP423-GFP fusion protein indicated that OsMLP423 was located in both the cell membrane system and nucleus
    + Compared with the wild type, the overexpressed OsMLP423 showed enhanced sensitivity to ABA
