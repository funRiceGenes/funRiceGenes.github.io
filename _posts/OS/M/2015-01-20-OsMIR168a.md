* **Publication**  
    + [CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OsMIR168a knockout reveals its pleiotropy in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2021, Plant Biotechnol J.

* **Key message**  
    + The rice OsMIR168a mutants grew rapidly at the seedling stage, produced more tillers, and matured early
    + Many protein-coding genes and miRNAs showed differential expression in the OsMIR168a mutants, suggesting OsMIR168a exerts a major transcriptional regulatory role, likely through its potential target genes such as OsAGO1s and OsAGO18
