    + Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.
    + In addition, the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity
    + Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling
    + Phenotypic analyses showed that the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants
    + Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice
    + We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
    + Furthermore, the osmed25 mutants retarded JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence
    + The results suggest that OsMED25 participates in JA-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence in rice
    + S-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were lower than those in the WT, whereas L-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were higher than those in the WT
    + In the present study, we isolated the loss-of function mutant of MED25, osmed25, through the map-based cloning and phenotypic complementation analysis by the introduction of OsMED25 and investigated the role of OsMED25 in JA signaling in rice
    + Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice
    + The expression of JA-responsive senescence-associated genes was not upregulated in response to JA in the osmed25 mutants
    + Phenotypic analyses revealed that OsMED25-RNAi and the osmed25 mutant plants exhibited enlarged panicles, with enhanced branching and spikelet number, similar to the dst mutant
    + Genetic analysis indicated that OsMED25 acts in the same pathway as the DST-OsCKX2 module to regulate spikelet number per panicle
    + Thus, OsMED25 was involved in the communication between DST and Pol II general transcriptional machinery to regulate spikelet number
    + In general, our findings reveal a novel function of OsMED25 in DST-OsCKX2 modulated transcriptional regulation, thus enhancing our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying DST-OsCKX2-mediated spikelet number
    + Furthermore, OsMED25 interacted with some AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (OsARFs) that regulate auxin signaling, whereas the mutated osmed25 protein did not interact with the OsARFs
    + The osmed25 loss-of-function mutant exhibited high resistance to Xoo
    + The expression of JA-responsive defense-related genes regulated by OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling, was downregulated in osmed25 mutants
    + These results indicate that OsMED25 plays an and auxin-mediated signaling in rice defense response
    + The expression of auxin-responsive genes was downregulated in osmed25 mutants, and auxin-induced susceptibility to Xoo was not observed in osmed25 mutants
