* **Key message**  
    + One of its putative partners, OsMY1, was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening from rice panicle cDNA library
    + Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns
    + Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development

    + __OsMY1__, __OsRacD~OsRac5__, [Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D), By yeast two-hybrid assay, it is confirmed that OsMY1 binds both the wild type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) OsRac5, but does not interact with dominantly negative OsRac5
