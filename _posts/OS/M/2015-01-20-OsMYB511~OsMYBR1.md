* **Key message**  
    + In the present research, a full-length MYB gene OsMYB511 was identified from rice seedlings through microarray data
    + Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that OsMYB511 was highly expressed in rice panicles at earlier development stage
    + Induction of OsMYB511 by cold stress was dramatic in japonica cultivar Jiucaiqing as compared to indica IR26
    + OsMYB511 encodes a MYB domain transcription activator early regulated by abiotic stress in rice.
    + The subcellular localization and yeast hybrid assay suggested that OsMYB511 is nucleus-localized transcription activator
    + Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic plants over-expressing OsMYBR1 exhibited much greater tolerance to drought stress and decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA)
    + Our results provide evidence that OsMYBR1 is involved in mediating plant responses to ABA and drought
