* **Key message**  
    + Both OsMT2b and OsMT2c were mainly and constitutively expressed in the phloem region of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes and of the anther
    + Knockout of either OsMT2b or OsMT2c increased zinc (Zn) accumulation in the nodes, but decreased Zn distribution to the panicle, resulting in decreased grain yield
    + Our results suggest that both OsMT2b and OsMT2c play an important role mainly in the distribution of Zn to grain through chelation and subsequent transport of Zn in the phloem in rice
