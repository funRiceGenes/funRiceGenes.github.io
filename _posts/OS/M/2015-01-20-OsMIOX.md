* **Key message**  
    + OsMIOX was expressed predominantly in the roots and induced by drought, H(2)O(2), salt, cold and abscisic acid
    + Together, these data suggest that OsMIOX has a specific function in drought stress tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage
    + OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + The transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsMIOX showed obviously improved growth performance in the medium containing 200 mM mannitol

* **Connection**  
    + __OsGGP__, __OsMIOX__, [Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D), KO of two isoforms of GDP-D-mannose epimerase (OsGME) reduced the foliar AsA level by 20-30 %, and KO of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (OsGGP) by 80 %, while KO of myo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels
