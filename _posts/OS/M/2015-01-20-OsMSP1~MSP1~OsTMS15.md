    + [AB103395](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB103395)

* **Key message**  
    + We propose that the recovered protein interaction together with slow development under low temperature compensates for the defective tapetum initiation, which further restores ostms15 fertility
    + OsTMS15 encodes an LRR-RLK protein MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE1 (MSP1) which was reported to interact with its ligand to initiate tapetum development for pollen formation
