* **Publication**  
    + [OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2019, New Phytol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Blocking OsmiR530 increases grain yield, whereas OsmiR530 overexpression significantly decreases grain size and panicle branching, leading to yield loss
    + OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.
    + We determined that OsmiR530 negatively regulates grain yield
    + Analyses of genetic variations suggested that the OsMIR530 locus has likely been subjected to artificial selection during rice breeding
