* **Key message**  
    + Blocking OsmiR530 increases grain yield, whereas OsmiR530 overexpression significantly decreases grain size and panicle branching, leading to yield loss
    + OsmiR530 acts downstream of OsPIL15 to regulate grain yield in rice.
    + We determined that OsmiR530 negatively regulates grain yield
    + Analyses of genetic variations suggested that the OsMIR530 locus has likely been subjected to artificial selection during rice breeding
