* **Key message**  
    + Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn(2+) than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis
    + Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn(2+)-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn(2+) homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance
    + OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice
    + The rgMT gene expression was induced in rice leaves and roots under several abiotic stresses from salts (NaCl and NaHCO3), drought (PEG) and metals (CuCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2)
    + A metallothionein-like protein of rice (rgMT) functions in E. coli and its gene expression is induced by abiotic stresses
    + Expression analysis revealed that OsMT1a predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMT1a demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought
    + Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type
    + OsMT1e was dominantly expressed in roots at all developmental stages and, to less extent, expressed in leaves at vegetative and seed filling stages
    + Expression of OsMT1e in a yeast Cd-sensitive strain ycf1 conferred cellular tolerance to Cd, even though the ycf1 + OsMT1e cells accumulated more Cd than the control cells (ycf1 + pYES2)
    + OsMT1e was mainly targeted to the nucleus and substantially induced by Cd exposure
    + Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation
