__RAPdb__: [Os08g0441300](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os08g0441300)  

## Publication
1. [A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, J Integr Plant Biol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Overexpression of Os08g34258 in Osmtd1 complemented the defects of the mutant architecture, while overexpression of OsmiR156f in wild-type rice phenocopied Osmtd1 |  We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 was significantly down-regulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of Os08g34258 in Osmtd1 complemented the defects of the mutant architecture, while overexpression of OsmiR156f in wild-type rice phenocopied Osmtd1  
__RNAi__:
