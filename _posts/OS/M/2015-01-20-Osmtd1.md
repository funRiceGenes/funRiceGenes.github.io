* **Key message**  
    + A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.
    + Here, we identified a T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 (Oryza sativa multi-tillering and dwarf mutant)
    + Moreover, we revealed that OsMTD1 not only influences rice tiller number and leaf angle, but also represses pri-miR156f transcription in the CNV region

* **Connection**  
    + __Osmtd1__, __OsSPL14~IPA1~WFP__, [A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.%5BTitle%5D), We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 was significantly down-regulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f
