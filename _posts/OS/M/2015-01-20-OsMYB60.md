* **Key message**  
    + Downregulation of TL by RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression of OsMYB60 resulted in twisted leaf blades in transgenic rice
    + This suggests that TL may play a cis-regulatory role on OsMYB60 in leaf morphological development
    + We further discovered that a C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, is an OsMYB60 binding partner and involved in leaf development
