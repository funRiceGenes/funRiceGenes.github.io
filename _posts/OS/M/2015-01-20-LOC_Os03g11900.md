* **Key message**  
    + Cellular location in young caryopses through RNA in situ hybridization showed that OsMST4 mRNA mainly accumulates in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm
    + These data indicate that OsMST4 is actively involved in monosaccharides supply for seed development during the course of grain filling
    + The deduced OsMST4 protein shows typical features of monosaccharide transporters, and shares high homology with other plant homologues
    + Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that OsMST4 is a functional monosaccharide transporter capable of transporting glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose
    + Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)

* **Connection**  
    + __OsMST4__, __OsNF-YB1__, [NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D), Real-time PCR performed in caryopses collected at 5 DAP showed that levels of SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 expression were reduced in nfyb1-1, while no evident reduction was observed for SUT2, suggesting that SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 may be regulated by NF-YB1
