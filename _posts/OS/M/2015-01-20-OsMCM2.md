## Key message
1. __seed__, [Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation%5BTitle%5D),  We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
2. __root__, [Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation%5BTitle%5D),  We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs
3. __cell cycle__, [Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replycation%5BTitle%5D),  Likewise, the OsMCM2 protein was ubiquitously expressed, but it was downregulated when nutritients were limiting, indicating that MCM2 expression and therefore cell cycle progression requires adequate nutrition
