* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated
    + Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors
    + A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening
    + RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
    + The APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like transcription factor OsMADS18 plays diverse functions in rice development, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are far from fully understood
    + Here, we report that downregulation of OsMADS18 expression in the RNAi lines caused delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression (OE) of OsMADS18 produced plants with less tillers
    + Finally, the results from analyzing the interaction of OsMADS18 with OsMADS14, OsMADS15, and OsMADS57 suggest an essential role of OsMADS18 in rice development
    + The expression of OsMADS18 could be stimulated by ABA, and ABA-stimulation triggered the cleavage of HA-OsMADS18 and the translocation of OsMADS18 from the PM to the nucleus
    + By combining pQTL and eQTL data, two genes were identified as controlling panicle structure: OsMADS18 modulates the average length of the primary rachis and OsFTL1 has pleiotropic effects on the total number of secondary rachides, number of grains per panicle, plant height and the length of flag leaves
