2. __meristem__, [Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated

4. __transcription factor__, [Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsMADS18, a member of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of MADS box genes%5BTitle%5D),  Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors
5. __seed__, [Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB%5BTitle%5D),  A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening
