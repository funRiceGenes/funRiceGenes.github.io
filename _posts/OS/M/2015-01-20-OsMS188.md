* **Key message**  
    + Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach
    + OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice
    + The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles
    + Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation
