* **Key message**  
    + Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3

* **Connection**  
    + __Osmyb2__, __Osmyb5__, [Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed%5BTitle%5D), RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
    + __Osmyb3~SG3~SMG3__, __Osmyb5__, [Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed%5BTitle%5D), RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
