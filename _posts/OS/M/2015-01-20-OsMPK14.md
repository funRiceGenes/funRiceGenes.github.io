* **Key message**  
    + Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression patterns of OsMPK14 in rice shoots and roots under darkness, drought, high salinity, low temperature and abscisic acid treatments
    + The OsMPK14 mRNA was induced by abscisic acid, low temperature and high salinity, but weakly inhibited by drought
    + In addition, the expression of OsMPK14 was up-regulated in roots, but down-regulated in shoots by light
