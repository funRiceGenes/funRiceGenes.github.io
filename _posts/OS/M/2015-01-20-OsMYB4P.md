* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMYB4P, an R2R3-type MYB transcriptional activator, increases phosphate acquisition in rice
    + OsMYB4P was localized in the nucleus and acted as a transcriptional activator.
    + In addition, root system architecture was altered considerably as a result of OsMYB4P overexpression.
    + These results demonstrate that OsMYB4P may be associated with efficient utilization of Pi in rice through transcriptional activation of Pi homeostasis-related genes.
