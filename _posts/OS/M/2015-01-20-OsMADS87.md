* **Key message**  
    + Molecular characterization of rice endosperm development under heat stress identifies OsMADS87 as a determinant of seed size and thermal sensitivity.
    + These seeds also have lower sensitivity to a moderate heat stress in terms of seed size reduction compared to seeds from wild type and plants over-expressing OsMADS87
    + Our findings suggest that OsMADS87 and several other genes identified in this study could be potential targets for improving thermal resilience of rice during reproductive development
    + Transgenic seeds deficient in OsMADS87 exhibit accelerated endosperm cellularization
