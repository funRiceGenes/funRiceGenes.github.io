* **Key message**  
    + In vivo and in vitro assays showed that three bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP23, OsbZIP66 and OsbZIP72, interacted with OsMFT2
    + Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment on imbibed seeds and seedlings indicated that OsMFT2 altered ABA sensitivity during seed germination and post-germination growth
    + OsMFT2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling-mediated seed germination through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 in rice.
    + All these results demonstrated that OsMFT2 positively regulates ABA response genes through interacting with OsbZIP23/66/72 and functions in seed germination
    + OsbZIP23/66/72 bound to the promoter of Rab16A, a typical ABA responsive element containing gene, and OsMFT2 enhanced their binding activities to Rab16A promoter
    + Moreover, several ABA responsive genes were differentially expressed in the imbibed seeds of OsMFT2 transgenic lines and wild-type
    + Performance of transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and expression decrease of ABA signaling genes caused by OsMFT2 knocking-out
    + Subcellular localization indicated that OsMFT2 was a nuclear protein
