## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D),  Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
2. __floral__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D),  Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
3. __lemma__, [Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D),  Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
4. __vegetative__, [Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed
5. __panicle__, [Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed
