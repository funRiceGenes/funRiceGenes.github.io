* **Key message**  
    + Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
    + In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed
    + Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that OsMADS1, OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 together regulate floral meristem determinacy, and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes
    + Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, conserved feature of plant SEP proteins
    + OsMADS5 was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues
