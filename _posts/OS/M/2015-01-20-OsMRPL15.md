* **Key message**  
    + The transcribed centromeric gene OsMRPL15 is essential for pollen development in rice.
    + Osmrpl15 pollen was completely sterile, with abnormalities appearing at the tricellular stage including the absence of starch granules and disrupted mitochondrial structure
    + Loss of OsMRPL15 caused abnormal accumulation of mitoribosomal proteins and large subunit rRNA in pollen mitochondria
    + Osmrpl15 pollen contained smaller amounts of intermediates related to starch metabolism than wild-type pollen, while biosynthesis of several amino acids was upregulated, possibly to compensate for defective mitochondrial protein biosynthesis and initiate consumption of carbohydrates necessary for starch biosynthesis
