* **Key message**  
    + Rice matrix metalloproteinase OsMMP1 plays pleiotropic roles in plant development and symplastic-apoplastic transport by modulating cellulose and callose depositions.
    + The plasma membrane-localized OsMMP1 protease affected plant development upon heterologous expression in tobacco and endogenous gene silencing in rice
    + Analyses of transcript accumulation and promoter-reporter gene expression revealed that OsMMP1 is spatio-temporally expressed in vegetative and reproductive parts of plants
    + Transgenic tobacco plants expressing OsMMP1 showed enhanced deposition of cellulose and callose, leading to impairment of symplastic and apoplastic translocations
    + Bacterially expressed recombinant OsMMP1 showed protease activity with bovine serum albumin and gelatin as substrates
