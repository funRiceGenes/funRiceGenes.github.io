* **Key message**  
    + Unlike the Arabidopsis atmkp1 loss-of-function mutant, which shows no abnormal phenotype without stimuli, osmkp1 showed a semi-dwarf phenotype
    + Exogenous supply of neither gibberellin nor brassinosteroid complemented the semi-dwarf phenotype of osmkp1
    + We confirmed that GSN1 is a negative regulator of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade that determines panicle architecture
    + Reduced expression of GSN1 resulted in larger and fewer grains, whereas increased expression resulted in more grains but reduced grain size
    + GSN1 encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase OsMKP1, a dual-specificity phosphatase of unknown function
    + GSN1 directly interacts with and inactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 via dephosphorylation
    + Consistent with this finding, the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes OsMPK6, OsMKK4, and OsMKKK10 separately resulted in denser panicles and smaller grains, which rescued the mutant gsn1 phenotypes
    + LARGE8 encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase1 (OsMKP1)
    + Overexpression of GLA1 caused a decrease in grain length, and the GLA1 protein interacted with OsMAPK6
    + These results suggest that GLA1 may serve as a negative regulator of the OsMAPKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade, controlling grain size via the dephosphorylation of OsMAPK6
    + The gla1 mutation was mapped to a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a gene encoding a cytoplasmically-localized mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase
