* **Key message**  
    + Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
    + In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
