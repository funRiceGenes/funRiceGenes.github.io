* **Key message**  
    + OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency
    + Through map-based cloning and functional analyses, we isolated the causal gene of fsv1, OsMLH3 encoding a MutL-homolog 3 protein, an ortholog of HvMLH3 in barley and AtMLH3 in Arabidopsis
