    + The rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by downregulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling.
    + Moreover, an osmyb102 knockout mutant showed an accelerated senescence phenotype under dark-induced and ABA-induced leaf senescence conditions
    + Collectively, these results demonstrate that OsMYB102 plays a critical role in leaf senescence by downregulating ABA accumulation and ABA signaling responses
    + Here, we examined the rice MYB TF gene OsMYB102 and found that an OsMYB102 T-DNA activation-tagged line (termed osmyb102-D), which constitutively expresses OsMYB102 under the control of four tandem repeats of the 35S promoter, and OsMYB102-overexpressing transgenic lines (35S:OsMYB102 and 35S:GFP-OsMYB102) maintain green leaves much longer than the wild type under natural, dark-induced, and abscisic acid (ABA)-induced senescence conditions
    + Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 regulates the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions
    + OsMYB102 inhibits ABA accumulation by directly activating the transcription of OsCYP707A6, which encodes the ABA catabolic enzyme ABSCISIC ACID 8'-HYDROXYLASE
