10. __OsEMF2b__, __OsMADS34~PAP2__, [The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, known to be required for meristem determinacy in rice, have reduced expression in the emf2b mutant, whereas OsMADS34 which interacts genetically with OsMADS1 was ectopically expressed.
