## Key message
1. __aluminum__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D), Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice
2. __transporter__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (OsMGT1), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased
3. __transporter__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results indicate that OsMGT1 is a transporter for Mg uptake in the roots and that up-regulation of this gene is required for conferring Al tolerance in rice by increasing Mg concentration in the cell

5. __Al tolerance__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results indicate that OsMGT1 is a transporter for Mg uptake in the roots and that up-regulation of this gene is required for conferring Al tolerance in rice by increasing Mg concentration in the cell
6. __magnesium__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (OsMGT1), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased

8. __cadmium__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (OsMGT1), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased
9. __root__, [Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsMGT1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots in the absence of Al, but the expression only in the roots was rapidly up-regulated by Al
