    + OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development.
    + Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.
    + Overall, we conclude that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of early JA signals in the JA-induced resistance against Xoo in rice
    + The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYC2 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and were more resistant to Xoo
    + Our results indicate that JA signalling via OsMYC2 is reinforced by OsMYL1 and OsMYL2, resulting in the inductive production of sakuranetin during defence responses in rice
    + Furthermore, a substantial change was noted in the expression of distinct types of transcription factors, such as MYB-type factors, likely depicting the importance of OsMYC2 in not only defence responses but also other morphogenetic events
    + OsMYC2 mediates numerous defence-related transcriptional changes via jasmonic acid signalling in rice.
    + The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive transcription factor OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct regulation of some senescence-associated genes in rice
    + Here, we report that OsMYC2 plays an important role in leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions
    + Overexpression of OsMYC2 significantly promoted leaf senescence, indicated by reduction of chlorophyll content under DIS conditions in rice
    + These results suggest that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct- or indirect-regulation of SAGs in rice
    + In agreement with AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 over-expression and RNAi lines showed enhanced and suppressed seedling growth compared to WT plants respectively under blue light, and showed little effect under white light or dark
    + However, the role of OsMYC2 in seedling development under ABA, dark or light of specific wavelengths was not known
    + However, in contrast to AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 influences seedling development under red light and show no effect in ABA-mediated seed germination
