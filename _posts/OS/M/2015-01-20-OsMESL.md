* **Key message**  
    + Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
    + Complementary T-DNA mutants demonstrated a phenotype similar to the wild type (WT), thereby indicating that osmesl confers resistance to pathogens
    + Overall, these results suggested that osmesl enhances disease resistance to Xoo, R
    + The abundance of JA, a hormone associated with disease resistance, was significantly more in osmesl mutants than in WT plants
    + Protein interaction experiments revealed that OsMESL affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by interacting with thioredoxin OsTrxm in rice
