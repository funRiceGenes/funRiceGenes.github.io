* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that<U+00A0>the transcription factor OsbHLH002/OsICE1 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3 under chilling stress
    + Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage
    + OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.
