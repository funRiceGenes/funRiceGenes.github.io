* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, expression studies using publically available resources showed that enhanced expression of OsMIZ1 is regulated in response to disease infections, mineral deficiency, and heavy metal stresses and is also expressed in reproductive tissues in addition to roots
    + These results highlight the possible involvement of OsMIZ1 in drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
