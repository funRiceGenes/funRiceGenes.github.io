## Key message
1. __plant development__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D)), SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development
2. __development__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D)), SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development

## Connection
1. __OsMED4__, __SAD1__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D)), Here we show that SAD1 interacts physically with the Mediator complex through a direct binding with OsMED4, a component of the middle module of the Mediator complex in rice. 
2. __OsMED4__, __OsRPC53__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D)), TFIIF2 and RPC53 are counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4.
3. __OsMED4__, __OsTFIIF2-1__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D)), TFIIF2 and RPC53 are counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4.
4. __OsMED4__, __OsTFIIF2-2__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D)), TFIIF2 and RPC53 are counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4.
