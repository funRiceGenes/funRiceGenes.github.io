* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + At the reproductive growth stage of the WT plant, OsMOT1;2 was highly expressed in the 2nd and lower leaf blades and nodes
    + The deletion of OsMOT1;2 impaired interorgan Mo allocation in aerial parts: relative to the WT, the mutant exhibited decreased Mo levels in the 1st and 2nd leaf blades and grains but increased Mo levels in the 2nd and lower leaf sheaths, nodes and internodes
