* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsMLO12 is highly expressed in mature pollen grains; plants containing alleles caused by transfer DNA insertions do not produce homozygous progeny
    + OsMLO12, encoding seven transmembrane proteins, is involved with pollen hydration in rice
