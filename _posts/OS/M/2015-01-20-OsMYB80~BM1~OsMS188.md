    + OsMYB80 regulates anther development and pollen fertility by targeting multiple biological pathways.
    + To understand how OsMYB80 regulates anther development, RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify genes differentially regulated by OsMYB80 in rice anthers
    + The osmyb80 mutants exhibited premature tapetum cell death, lack of Ubisch bodies, no exine, and microspore degeneration
    + Here we isolated two allelic male sterile mutants of OsMYB80 and investigated how OsMYB80 regulates male fertility in rice
    + Functional annotation of the 188 genes suggested that OsMYB80 regulates male fertility by directly targeting multiple biological processes
    + Moreover, BM1 affects the expression of several known genes related to tapetum and microspore development
    + Collectively, our results suggest that BM1 is one of key regulators for rice male fertility and may serve as a potential target for rice male-sterile line breeding and hybrid seed production
    + The bm1 mutant exhibited slightly lagging meiosis, aborted transition of the tapetum to a secretory type, premature tapetal degeneration, and abnormal pollen exine formation, leading to ultimately lacks of visible pollens in the mature white anthers
    + Map-based cloning, complementation and targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas9 technology demonstrated that the mutated LOC_Os04g39470 is the causal gene in bm1
    + Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach
    + OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice
    + The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles
    + Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation
