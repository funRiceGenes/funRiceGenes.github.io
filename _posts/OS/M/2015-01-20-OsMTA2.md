* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsMTA2  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os02g45110](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g45110)

    + [The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The subunit of RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase OsFIP regulates early degeneration of microspores in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2019, PLoS Genet.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we reported that OsFIP and OsMTA2 are the components of m6A RNA methyltransferase complex in rice and uncovered a previously unknown function of m6A RNA methylation in regulation of plant sporogenesis
    + OseIF3h Regulates Plant Growth and Pollen Development at Translational Level Presumably through Interaction with OsMTA2
    + Therefore, we infer that OseIF3h interacts with OsMTA2 to target a particular subset of genes at translational level, regulating plant growth and pollen development
