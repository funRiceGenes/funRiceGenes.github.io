* **Key message**  
    + Rice seedlings overexpressing OsMADS15 showed precocious phenotypes of early internode elongation, shoot-borne crown root development, reduced plant height and early flowering
    + These results clearly indicate that OsMADS15 plays important roles not only in transition to reproductive development, but also in crown root development
    + Thus, OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are both required to ensure sexual reproduction in rice and mutations of them lead to the switch of reproductive habit from sexual to asexual in rice
    + In the tillering stage, the OsMADS15 overexpression rice plants tillered later and less than the wild type, and in the maturity stage, the culms of the overexpression lines bore more stem nodes
    + Overexpression of a Transcription Factor OsMADS15 Modifies Plant Architecture and Flowering Time in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
    + The panicles of OsMADS15 transgenic rice plants were largely compromised for growth and branching in comparison with wild type
    + DEP and AFO regulate reproductive habit in rice
    + In this work, we found three naturally occurring mutants in rice, namely, phoenix (pho), degenerative palea (dep), and abnormal floral organs (afo)
    + Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that expression levels of WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, and some flowering regulators were promoted in the OsMADS15 overexpression transgenic plants, indicating that OsMADS15 had a wide range of regulations
    + Further depletion of PAP2 function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM
    + The axillary buds developments in OsMADS15 overexpressors were accelerated, and the buds frequently grew into effective tillers
