* **Key message**  
    + The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells
    + In this study, we characterized and compared the profiles of genome-wide lncRNA profiles (including long intergenic non-coding RNAs [lincRNAs] and long noncoding natural antisense transcripts [lncNATs]) of a null mutant of the rice DNA methyltransferase 1, OsMET1-2 (designated OsMET1-2-/-) and its isogenic wild type (OsMET1-2+/+)
    + We constructed a high-resolution Hi-C interaction map for the null OsMET1-2 (the major CG methyltransferase in rice) mutant (osmet1-2) and isogenic wild-type rice (WT)
