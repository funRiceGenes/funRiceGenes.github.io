* **Key message**  
    + It is proposed that OsMKK3 mediated positive regulation of rice resistance to BPH by means of herbivory-induced phytohormone dynamics
    + It was observed that mechanical wounding, infestation of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA) could induce the expression of OsMKK3
    + The over-expression of OsMKK3 (oe-MKK3) increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased SA levels in rice after BPH attack
