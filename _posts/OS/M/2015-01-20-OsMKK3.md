* **Key message**  
    + It is proposed that OsMKK3 mediated positive regulation of rice resistance to BPH by means of herbivory-induced phytohormone dynamics
    + It was observed that mechanical wounding, infestation of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA) could induce the expression of OsMKK3
    + The over-expression of OsMKK3 (oe-MKK3) increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased SA levels in rice after BPH attack
    + Here, we show that OsMKK3 encode a MAP kinase kinase that controls grain size and chalkiness by affecting cell proliferation in spikelet hulls
    + Natural Variation in OsMKK3 Contributes to Grain Size and Chalkiness in Rice.
    + Wild rice accessions contained four OsMKK3 haplotypes, suggesting that the OsMKK3 haplotypes present in cultivated rice likely originated from different wild rice accessions during rice domestication
    + Overall, the results indicated that beneficial OsMKK3 alleles could be used for genomic-assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement and be polymerized with other beneficial alleles
