* **Key message**  
    + Nipponbare) C(2) H(2) -type ZFP ZFP182 in ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the relationship between ZFP182 and two rice MAPKs, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 in ABA signaling were investigated
    + ABA treatment induced the increases in the expression of ZFP182, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in rice leaves
    + Besides, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 were shown to be required for the up-regulation in the expression of ZFP182 in ABA signaling, but ZFP182 did not mediate the ABA-induced up-regulation in the expression of OsMPK1 and OsMPK5
    + A time course (30-120 min) experiment using a variety of elicitors and stresses revealed that the OsSIPK mRNA is strongly induced by jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethephon, abscisic acid, cycloheximide (CHX), JA/SA + CHX, cantharidin, okadaic acid, hydrogen peroxide, chitosan, sodium chloride, and cold stress (12 degrees C), but not with wounding by cut, gaseous pollutants ozone, and sulfur dioxide, high temperature, ultraviolet C irradiation, sucrose, and drought
    + ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves
    + Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice
    + Of these, rice OsSIPK (Salicylic acid (SA)-Induced Protein Kinase) and its orthologs in other plants are of particular interest
    + ) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), OsSIPK (salicylic acid-induced protein kinase)
    + Steady state mRNA analyses of OsSIPK showed weak constitutive expression in leaves of 2-week-old rice seedlings
    + In this minireview, we discuss the recent progress on rice OsSIPK and its orthologs as a central master switch for mediating plant responses against ozone, wounding, and JA as examples
    + Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice
    + Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
    + OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, influences rice grain size and biomass production
    + Thus, OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, plays a pivotal role in grain size, via cell proliferation, and BR signaling and homeostasis, in  rice.
    + Further biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that OsMKKK10, OsMKK4 and OsMAPK6 function in a common pathway to control grain size
    + Phosphorylation of bip130 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid-induced antioxidant defense in rice.
    + Furthermore, bip130 can be phosphorylated by OsMPK1 at Thr-153 inËÅΩvitro, and Thr-153 is essential for the ABA-induced antioxidant defense by OsMPK1
    + These results reveal that OsMPK1 phosphorylates bip130 at Thr-153 to regulate ABA-induced antioxidant defense
    + The OsMPK1:GFP and OsWRKY90:GFP transcription factor were localized to the nuclei, suggesting that OsMPK1 in the cytoplasm moves into the nuclei to interact with the WRKY90
    + These combined results suggest that OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 expression positively regulates iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death, and blast disease (susceptibility)-related cell death was ROS-dependent but iron-independent in rice-M
    + Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 Signaling Is Required for Ferroptotic Cell Death in Rice- Magnaporthe oryzae Interactions
    + The mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK1 is involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + We also found that OsABA2 has feedback regulation on OsMPK1 kinase activity
    + However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of OsMPK1 in regulating ABA biosynthesis are poorly understood
    + Further research reveals that OsMPK1 and OsABA2 coordinately regulate the biosynthesis of ABA, and phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 plays a crucial role in regulating the biosynthesis of ABA
    + Phosphorylation of OsABA2 at Ser197 by OsMPK1 regulates abscisic acid biosynthesis in rice.
    + Here, by using yeast two-hybrid assay and firefly luciferase complementary imaging assay, we show that OsMPK1 physically interact with a short-chain dehydrogenase protein OsABA2
    + OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.
    + OsMAPK6 physically interacted with and phosphorylated OsLIC leading to decreased OsLIC DNA-binding activity, therefore, overexpression of OsLIC partially suppressed OsMAPK6-mediated rice resistance
