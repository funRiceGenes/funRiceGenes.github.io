* **Key message**  
    + Identification of natural allelic variation in OsMOT1;1 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with Mo enriched grain for dietary needs and improve Mo nutrition of rice on Mo-deficient soils
    + Genetic mapping of ionomic quantitative trait loci in rice grain and straw reveals OsMOT1;1 as the putative causal gene for a molybdenum QTL qMo8.
    + Furthermore, we identified a molybdate transporter gene OsMOT1;1 as the putative causal gene for a QTL controlling molybdenum concentration in both straw and grain
