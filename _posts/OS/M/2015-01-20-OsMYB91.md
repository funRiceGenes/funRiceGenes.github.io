* **Key message**  
    + The R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB91 has a function in coordinating plant growth and salt stress tolerance in rice.
    + Plants over-expressing OsMYB91 showed reduced plant growth and accumulation of endogenous ABA under control conditions
    + These results suggested that OsMYB91 was a stress-responsive gene that might be involved in coordinating rice tolerance to abiotic stress and plant growth by regulating SLR1 expression
    + OsMYB91 was induced by abiotic stress, especially by salt stress
    + In addition, expression of OsMYB91 was also induced by other abiotic stresses and hormone treatment
