* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
    + GF14A protein affects the repression activity of OsMYBS2 by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and Ser53 is necessary for OsMYBS2 to be retained in the cytoplasm
