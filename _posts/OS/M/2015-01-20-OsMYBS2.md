## Key message
1. __seed__, [Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression%5BTitle%5D),  Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
