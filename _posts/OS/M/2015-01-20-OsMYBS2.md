* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
    + GF14A protein affects the repression activity of OsMYBS2 by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and Ser53 is necessary for OsMYBS2 to be retained in the cytoplasm
    + The OsMYBS2 transcription factor was shown recently to reduce activation of the αAmy3 promoter by competing for the binding site of the TA box of the αAmy3 promoter with the potent OsMYBS1 activator
    + CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that knockdown of the transcription factor gene OsMYBS2 increased the activity of the αAmy3 promoter and improved the yield of recombinant proteins secreted in rice cell suspension cultures
