* **Publication**  
    + [OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), 2007, J Exp Bot.

    + [AF458088](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AF458088)

* **Key message**  
    + OsMTN transcripts and OsMTN-specific activity increased slowly and in parallel upon submergence, indicating that regulation occurred mainly at the transcriptional level
    + OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Neither ethylene, MTA, nor Met regulated OsMTN expression
