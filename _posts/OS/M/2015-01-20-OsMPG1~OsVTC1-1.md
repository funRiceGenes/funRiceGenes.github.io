    + Functional screening of cDNA library from a salt tolerant rice genotype Pokkali identifies mannose-1-phosphate guanyl transferase gene (OsMPG1) as a key member of salinity stress response
    + These MPG genes showed differential expression under various abiotic stresses with two genes (OsMPG1 and 3) showing high induction in response to multiple stresses
    + Functional validation of OsMPG1 carried out by overexpression in the transgenic tobacco revealed its involvement in enhancing salinity stress tolerance
    + Analysis of rice microarray data indicated higher expression levels for OsMPG1 in specific tissues such as roots, leaves, shoot apical meristem and different stages of panicle and seed development, thereby indicating its developmental regulation
    + Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.
    + Intriguingly, grain yield of OsVTC1-1 RNAi rice was also significantly reduced under salt stress, indicating that OsVTC1-1 plays an important role in salt tolerance of rice at both seedling and reproductive stages
    + Knocking Down the Expression of GMPase Gene OsVTC1-1 Decreases Salt Tolerance of  Rice at Seedling and Reproductive Stages
    + Studies have shown that heterologous expression of rice GMPase OsVTC1-1  enhanced salt tolerance of tobacco seedlings, but the native role of OsVTC1-1 in  salt stress tolerance of rice is unknown
    + To illustrate the native function of GMPase in response of rice to salt stress, OsVTC1-1 expression was suppressed using RNAi-mediated gene silencing
    + Suppressing OsVTC1-1 expression obviously decreased salt tolerance of rice varieties at vegetative stage
    + OsVTC1-1 RNAi rice accumulated more ROS under salt stress, and supplying exogenous ascorbic acid restored salt tolerance of OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines, suggesting that OsVTC1-1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice through the biosynthesis regulation of ascorbic acid
    + Altogether, results of present study showed that rice GMPase gene OsVTC1-1 plays  a critical role in salt tolerance of rice at both vegetative and reproductive stages through AsA scavenging of excess ROS
    + OsVTC1-1 Gene Silencing Promotes a Defense Response in Rice and Enhances Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.
    + These results suggest that the OsVTC1-1 gene regulates rice blast resistance through several defense mechanisms, including hormone synthesis and signaling pathways
    + Genes and proteins related to defense response, plant hormone synthesis, and signaling pathways, especially salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, were up-regulated in the OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines after rice blast inoculation
    + Using OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines, this study investigated the role of the OsVTC1-1 gene during rice blast fungus inoculation
    + The OsVTC1-1 RNAi inoculated with rice blast fungus induced changes to cell wall monosaccharides, photosynthetic efficiency, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content
    + Additionally, the OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines were shown to be more resistant to rice blast fungus than the wild type
