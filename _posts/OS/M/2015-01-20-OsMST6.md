* **Key message**  
    + RNA in situ hybridization analysis indicated that OsMST6 is predominantly expressed in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm of young seeds, in mesophyll cells of source leaf blades, and in pollens and the connective vein of anthers
    + In this study, a new monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L
    + The predicted OsMST6 protein shows typical features of sugar transporters and shares 79
    + Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) demonstrated that OsMST6 is a broad-spectrum monosaccharide transporter, with a K (m) of 266
    + Molecular cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis of a novel monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + In addition, OsMST6 expression is up-regulated by salt stress and sugars
    + In developing seeds, OsMST6 expression level is high at the early and middle grain filling stages and gradually declines later
    + The physiological role of OsMST6 for seed development and its roles in other sink and source tissues are discussed
