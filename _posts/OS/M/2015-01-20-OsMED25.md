* **Key message**  
    + Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.
    + In addition, the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity
    + Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling
    + Phenotypic analyses showed that the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants
