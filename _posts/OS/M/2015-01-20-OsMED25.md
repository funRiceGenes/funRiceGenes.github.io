* **Key message**  
    + Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.
    + In addition, the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity
    + Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling
    + Phenotypic analyses showed that the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants
    + Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice
    + We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice
    + Furthermore, the osmed25 mutants retarded JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence
    + The results suggest that OsMED25 participates in JA-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence in rice
    + S-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were lower than those in the WT, whereas L-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were higher than those in the WT
    + In the present study, we isolated the loss-of function mutant of MED25, osmed25, through the map-based cloning and phenotypic complementation analysis by the introduction of OsMED25 and investigated the role of OsMED25 in JA signaling in rice
    + Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice
    + The expression of JA-responsive senescence-associated genes was not upregulated in response to JA in the osmed25 mutants
