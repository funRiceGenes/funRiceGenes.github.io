## Expression information
__Expression__:A gene expression profiling of early rice stamen development that reveals inhibition of photosynthetic genesby OsMADS58. |  Following the finding of systematic low expression of nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic proteins in early rice stamen, we found that a C-class MADS box protein OsMADS58 can bind many nuclear coded photosystem and other light reaction genes based on ChIP-seq analysis |  When the expression level of OsMADS58 is downregulated, e |  in osmads58 mutant, the expression levels of OsMADS58 target genes increase, more prochloroplasts are observed, and more ROS signal is detected in the mutant anthers

5. __CCP1~DFO1~EMF1__, __OSMADS58__, [CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.%5BTitle%5D),  Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development
6. __CCP1~DFO1~EMF1__, __OSMADS58__, [CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results show that CCP1 plays an important role in palea development through maintaining H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic silence of the carpel identity-specifying gene OsMADS58, shedding light on the epigenetic mechanism in floral organ development
7. __OsMADS1~LHS1~AFO__, __OSMADS58__, [Interactions of OsMADS1 with Floral Homeotic Genes in Rice Flower Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interactions of OsMADS1 with Floral Homeotic Genes in Rice Flower Development.%5BTitle%5D),  The physical and genetic interaction of OsMADS1 and OsMADS3 is essential for floral meristem activity maintenance and organ identity specification; while OsMADS1 physically and genetically interacts with OsMADS58 in regulating floral meristem determinacy and suppressing spikelet meristem reversion
