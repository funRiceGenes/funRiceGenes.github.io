* **Key message**  
    + OsMKKK70 regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice through the OsMKK4-OsMAPK6-OsWRKY53 signaling pathway.
    + Here we demonstrate that the Oryza sativa Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase OsMKKK70 regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice
    + The osmkkk62/70 double mutant and the osmkkk55/62/70 triple mutant displayed significantly smaller seeds and a more erect leaf angle compared to the wild type, indicating that OsMKKK70 functions redundantly with its homologs OsMKKK62 and OsMKKK55
    + Taken together, these findings suggest that OsMKKK70 might regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice by activating OsMAPK6 and that OsMKKK70, OsMKK4, OsMAPK6, and OsWRKY53 function in a common signaling pathway that controls grain shape and leaf angle
    + Biochemical analysis demonstrated that OsMKKK70 is an active kinase and that OsMKKK70 interacts with OsMKK4 and promotes OsMAPK6 phosphorylation
