* **Key message**  
    + An MBP (myelin basic protein) kinase assay of the immunoprecipitation complex indicated that OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were activated in response to a moderately low temperature (12 degrees C), but not a severely low temperature (4 degrees C) in rice seedlings
    + Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes
    + These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion
    + Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance
    + Here we report that OsMPK6 is an important regulator in rice disease resistance
    + Mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 negatively regulates rice disease resistance to bacterial pathogens
    + The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X
    + Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants
    + Here, immunoprecipitated OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were initially activated in 15min, and this activation transiently increased in rice seedlings under H2O2 stress
    + A redox-sensitive cysteine residue regulates the kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro.
    + An ABA treatment dephosphorylated/inactivated OsMPK6 via protein tyrosine phosphatases, OsPTP1/2, leading to the impaired activation of WRKY45 and a reduction in Magnaporthe oryzae resistance, even after BTH treatment
    + WRKY45 is a central regulator of disease resistance mediated by salicylic acid signaling in rice and its activation involves phosphorylation by OsMPK6
    + Expressing OsMPK4 Impairs Plant Growth but Enhances the Resistance of Rice to the Striped Stem Borer Chilo suppressalis.
    + The overexpression of OsMPK4 (oe-MPK4) enhanced constitutive and/or SSB-induced levels of JA, jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), ethylene (ET), and SA, as well as the activity of elicited trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TrypPIs), and reduced SSB performance
