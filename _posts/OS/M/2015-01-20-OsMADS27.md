* **Key message**  
    + OsMADS27 regulates the root development in a NO3--Dependent manner and modulates the salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Here we investigated the roles of OsMADS27 in the root development in response to NO3- availability
    + Constitutive expression of OsMADS27 significantly inhibited the elongation of primary root (PR), but enhanced lateral root (LR) formation in a NO3--dependent manner
    + ABA is reported to play an important role in mediating the effects of NO3- on the root development, thus it is supposed that OsMADS27 might regulate the root growth and development by ABA pathway
    + The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type
    + Taken together, our findings suggested that OsMADS27 is an important regulator controlling the root system development and adaption to osmotic stress in rice
    + OsMADS27 is one of the ANR1-like homologues in rice, whreas its functions in plant growth and development as well as the abiotic stress responses remain unclear
    + More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance
    + Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants
    + Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes
