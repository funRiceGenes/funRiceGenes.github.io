* **Key message**  
    + Heterogeneous overexpression of OsMAR1 in Arabidopsis showed retarded root growth compared with that of control plants, and then led to hypersensitivity phenotypes under high salinity stress
    + Herein, we found that a rice gene, OsMAR1 (Oryza sativa microtubule-associated RING finger protein 1), encoding the RING E3 ligase was highly expressed in response to high salinity, water deficit, and ABA treatment
    + Taken together, OsMAR1 negatively regulates the salt-stress response via the regulation of the OCPI2 protein in rice
