    + OsmiR528 Enhances Cold Stress Tolerance by Repressing Expression of Stress Response-related Transcription Factor Genes in Plant Cells.
    + To investigate the potential mechanism of OsmiR528 in increasing cold stress tolerance, we examined expression of stress-associated MYB transcription factors OsGAMYB-like1, OsMYBS3, OsMYB4, OsMYB3R-2, OsMYB5, OsMYB59, OsMYB30, OsMYB1R, and OsMYB20 in rice cells by qRT-PCR
    + Our experiments demonstrated that OsmiR528 decreases expression of transcription factor OsMYB30 by targeting a F-box domain containing protein gene (Os06g06050), which is a positive regulator of OsMYB30
    + The transcript levels of the OsBMY2, OsBMY6, and OsBMY10 were elevated by OsMYB30 knockdown, but decreased by Os-MYB30 overexpression in OsmiR528 transgenic cell lines, suggesting that OsmiR528 increases low temperature tolerance by modulating expression of stress response-related transcription factor
    + We further demonstrated that OsmiR528 affects pollen development by directly targeting the uclacyanin gene OsUCL23 (encoding a member of the plant-specific blue copper protein family of phytocyanins) and regulating intine deposition
    + We propose a model in which OsmiR528 regulates pollen intine formation by directly targeting OsUCL23 and in which OsUCL23 interacts with the POT protein on the PVCs and MVBs to regulate the production of metabolites during pollen development
    + The study thus reveals the functions of OsmiR528 and an uclacyanin during pollen development
