* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD
    + These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
    + OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice
    + 8, OsMADS56 encoding a MADS-box transcription factor, was performed in this study
    + In these populations, decreased grain weight and size were associated with a reduction in the expression of OsMADS56
    + In transgenic populations of OsMADS56 driven by a strong constitutive promoter, grain weight and size of the positive plants were significantly higher than those of the negative plants
    + Cloning of OsMADS56 provides a new gene resource to improve grain weight and size through molecular design breeding
    + Control of Thousand-Grain Weight by OsMADS56 in Rice.
    + GL10 regulates grain length by promoting greater longitudinal cell growth in the grain glume
    + 0-kb deletion in the first exon that abolishes its transcription, results in shorter grain length, lower grain weight and delayed flowering in gl10 plants
    + The knockout of GL10 in the HJX74 background leads to grain phenotypes similar to that of NIL-gl10, while overexpression of GL10 results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date
    + Our findings reveal an allelic variation of GL10 that may explain differences in grain length among modern cultivars and could be used to breed rice varieties with optimized grain shape
    + Additionally, GL10 participates in the regulation of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway genes in young panicle tissues
