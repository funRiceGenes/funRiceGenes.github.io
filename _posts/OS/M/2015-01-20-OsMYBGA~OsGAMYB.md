* **Key message**  
    + Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB
    + High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
    + No alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm was induced in these mutants in response to GA treatment, indicating that the Tos17 insertion had knocked out OsGAMYB function
    + The sequences were also required for effective transactivation by the transcription factor OsGAMyb
    + These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in the induction of alpha-amylase in aleurone, OsGAMYB also is important for floral organ development and essential for pollen development
    + Thus, OsGAMYB and OsGAMYB-like genes are regulated by miR159 in flowers
    + Four copies of either GARE or CARE showed transactivation neither by OsGAMyb nor by GA induction
    + <U+2022> Further analysis showed that transcription factor of OsGAMYB was an activator of OsTPP1, and expression of OsGAMYB was decreased by both the exogenous and endogenous ABA, subsequently reduced the expression of OsTPP1, which suggested a new signaling pathway required for seed germination in rice
    + MiR319-targeted OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb regulate tillering and grain yield in rice
    + These data suggest that miR319 regulates rice tiller bud development and tillering through targeting OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb
    + Notably, the tiller number and grain yield increased in STTM319 and overexpression lines of OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb but decreased in OE319a and knockout lines of OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb
    + Moreover, OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb overexpression lines and STTM319 had increased tiller bud length and biomass, whereas both were decreased in OsTCP21 and OsGAmyb knockout lines and OE319a
    + Using transient dual-luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays, IPA1 was found to directly activate the expression of OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71, which would interfere with the binding affinity of GA-induced transcription factor OsGAMYB to inhibit the expression of <a6><c1>-amylase genes
