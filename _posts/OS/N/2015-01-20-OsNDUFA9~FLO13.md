* **Key message**  
    + OsNDUFA9 encoding a mitochondrial complex I subunit is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice.
    + Our results demonstrate that the OsNDUFA9 subunit of complex I is essential for embryo development and starch synthesis in rice endosperm
    + OsNDUFA9 was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and the OsNDUFA9 protein was localized to the mitochondria
    + Quantitative RT-PCR and protein blotting indicated loss of function of OsNDUFA9 altered gene expression and protein accumulation associated with respiratory electron chain complex in the mitochondria
