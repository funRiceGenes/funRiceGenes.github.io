4. __root__, [Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn

8. __seed__, [Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis by size exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy showed that WT and OsNAS3-D1 seeds contained equal amounts of Fe bound to IP6, whereas OsNAS3-D1 had 7-fold more Fe bound to a low molecular mass, which was likely NA
