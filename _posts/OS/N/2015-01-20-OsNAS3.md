* **Key message**  
    + In contrast, the OsNAS3 transcript was present in leaves but was very low in roots of Fe-sufficient plants
    + Further, OsNAS3 expression was induced in roots but was suppressed in leaves in response to Fe deficiency
    + OsNAS3 expression was restricted to the pericycle and companion cells of the roots, and in companion cells of leaves irrespective of Fe status
    + Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn
    + Seeds from our OsNAS3-D1 plants grown on a paddy field contained elevated amounts of Fe (2
    + 6-fold in OsNAS3-D1 seeds
    + Analysis by size exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy showed that WT and OsNAS3-D1 seeds contained equal amounts of Fe bound to IP6, whereas OsNAS3-D1 had 7-fold more Fe bound to a low molecular mass, which was likely NA
    + Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR
    + Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron
