* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning revealed that all of the observed mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in a putative NST gene, Oryza sativa Nucleotide Sugar Transporter1 (OsNST1)
    + OsNST1 was identified as a Golgi-localized transporter by analysis of a fluorescence-tagged OsNST1 expressed in rice protoplast cells and demonstration of UDP-glucose transport activity via uptake assays in yeast
    + The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth
    + Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
    + A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development
    + Identification of OsNST1 has improved our understanding of how cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is regulated by Golgi NSTs in plants
    + We previously examined cell wall composition of bc14 and wild type plants
