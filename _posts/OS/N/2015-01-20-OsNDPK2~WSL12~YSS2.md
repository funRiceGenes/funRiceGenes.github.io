* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol
    + Three different programs for predicting subcellular targeting indicated that OsNDPK1 and NP922751 were non-organellar, OsNDPK2 plastidic, and OsNDPK3 mitochondrial
    + The WSL12 protein localized to the chloroplast
    + These results indicate that the OsNDPK2 encoded by WSL12 plays an important role in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis by regulating the expression levels of related genes
    + Map-based cloning revealed that the WSL12 locus encoded OsNDPK2, one of the three nucleoside diphosphate kinases (OsNDPKs)
    + The wsl12 mutant showed higher superoxide anion level and enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity
    + In addition, WSL12 also affects the response to abiotic stress, such as ABA and salinity in rice, and is beneficial to molecular breeding of stress tolerance
    + The transcription pattern of many genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, ABA synthesis, light signaling pathway, reactive oxygen species-scavenging pathway and the other two OsNDPKs was altered in the wsl12 mutant
    + We isolated a rice mutant named yss2 (young seedling stripe2) with a striated seedling phenotype beginning from leaf 2 of delayed plant growth
    + Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that YSS2 transcripts accumulated highly in L4 sections at the early leaf development stage
    + Chlorotic yss2 seedlings have decreased pigment contents and impaired chloroplast development
    + Expression levels of genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis in yss2 were mostly decreased, but genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis were up-regulated compared to the wild type
    + Our overall data suggest that YSS2 has important roles in chloroplast biogenesis
    + The YSS2 allele encodes a NDPK2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2) protein showing high similarity to other types of NDPKs
