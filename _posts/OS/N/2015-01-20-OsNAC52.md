* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic plants over-expressing OsNAC52 were highly sensitive to ABA (Abscisic acid), and the growth of the 35S-OsNAC52 transgenic seedlings was significantly more restrained by ABA treatment than those of the wild-type seedlings
    + Furthermore, over-expression of OsNAC52 activated the expression of downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced tolerance to drought stresses but not growth retardation
    + The results from this study indicate that this novel rice OsNAC52 gene functions as an important transcriptional activator in ABA-inducible gene expression and may be useful in improving plant tolerance to abiotic stress
