* **Key message**  
    + This study revealed that OsNUDX14 is associated with plant development and grain chalkiness, providing a potential opportunity to optimize plant architecture and quality for crop breeding
    + In addition, OsNUDX14 affected grain chalkiness in rice
    + Results showed that OsNUDX14 is constitutively expressed in various tissues and most strongly expressed in mature leaves
    + In the present study, we identified and characterized OsNUDX14 localized in the mitochondria in rice
    + Furthermore, transcript profile analysis indicated that OsNUDX14 is associated with lignin biosynthesis in rice
