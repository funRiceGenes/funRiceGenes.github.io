* **Key message**  
    + The data suggest that, in addition to ABA biosynthesis, the monocot OsNCED3 gene may have additional functions in shaping leaf morphology and vascular bundle development in Arabidopsis
    + Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology
    + Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type
    + As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA
    + The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers
    + Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the monocot OsNCED3 gene in a wild-type background result in a smaller and rounder leaf shape and midvein
    + Further analysis found that nced3 mutants contained lower ABA content compared with wild-type plants, overexpression of OsNCED3 in transgenic plants could enhance water stress tolerance, promote leaf senescence and increase ABA content
    + We conclude that OsNCED3 mediates seed dormancy, plant growth, abiotic stress tolerance, and leaf senescence by regulating ABA biosynthesis in rice; and may provide a new strategy for improving the quality of crop
    + Here, we report important functions of OsNCED3 in multi-abiotic stress tolerance in rice
    + The OsNCED3 is constitutively expressed in various tissues under normal condition, Its expression is highly induced by NaCl, PEG, and H2O2 stress, suggesting the roles for OsNCED3 in response to the multi-abiotic stress tolerance in rice
    + CRISPR/Cas9-edited OsNCED3 resulted in chilling sensitive of japonica rice ZH11, demonstrating the involvement of ABA pathway in chilling stress response
