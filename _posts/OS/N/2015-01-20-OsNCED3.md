* **Key message**  
    + The data suggest that, in addition to ABA biosynthesis, the monocot OsNCED3 gene may have additional functions in shaping leaf morphology and vascular bundle development in Arabidopsis
    + Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology
    + Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type
    + As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA
    + The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers
    + Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the monocot OsNCED3 gene in a wild-type background result in a smaller and rounder leaf shape and midvein
