* **Key message**  
    + Now, we screened 927 seeds from 70 Ac/Ds plants for salinity tolerance and identified one activation-tagged salt tolerant DS plant (DS-16, T3 generation) that showed enhanced expression of a novel 'histone-like transcription factor' belonging to rice NF-Y subfamily C and was named as OsNF-YC13
    + Real time expression analysis confirmed upregulation of transcript levels of OsNF-YC13 during salt treatment in a tissue specific manner
