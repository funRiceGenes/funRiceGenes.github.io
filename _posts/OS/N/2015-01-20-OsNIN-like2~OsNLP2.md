* **Key message**  
    + OsNLP2 was localized to the plant cell nucleus, suggesting that it acts as a transcription factor
    + OsNLP2 expression was involved in susceptible disease development
    + These combined results suggest that OsNLP2 acts as a negative regulator of ferroptotic HR cell death and defense responses in rice, and may be a valuable gene source for molecular breeding of rice with broad-spectrum resistance to blast disease
    + The NIN-Like Protein OsNLP2 Negatively Regulates Ferroptotic Cell Death and Immune Responses to Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.
    + Here, we report that OsNLP2 negatively regulates ferroptotic cell death and immune responses in rice during Magnaporthe oryzae infection
