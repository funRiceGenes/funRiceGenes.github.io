* **Key message**  
    + The expression of the ABA biosynthetic gene OsAO3 is downregulated in OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots under normal conditions, while the expression of OsNPC3, an AtNPC4 homolog involved in ABA sensitivity, is reduced in OsERF106MZ-overexpressing roots under both normal and NaCl-treated conditions.
