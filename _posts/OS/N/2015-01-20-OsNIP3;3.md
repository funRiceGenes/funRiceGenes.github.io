* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 provides a route for arsenite to leak out of the stele, thus restricting arsenite loading into the xylem
    + The overexpressed OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 proteins were localized in all root cells without polarity
    + Overexpression of OsNIP1;1 or OsNIP3;3 in rice did not affect arsenite uptake but decreased root-to-shoot translocation of arsenite and shoot arsenic concentration markedly
    + Decreasing arsenic accumulation in rice by overexpressing OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 through disrupting arsenite radial transport in roots.
    + OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;3 were highly permeable to arsenite in Xenopus oocyte assays
