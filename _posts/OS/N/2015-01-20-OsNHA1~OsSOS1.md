* **Key message**  
    + The rice transporter, denoted by OsSOS1, demonstrated a capacity for Na+/H+ exchange in plasma membrane vesicles of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells and reduced their net cellular Na+ content
    + The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
    + In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells
    + Moreover, OsSOS1 suppressed the salt sensitivity of a sos1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis
    + OsCIPK24 and OsCBL4 acted coordinately to activate OsSOS1 in yeast cells and they could be exchanged with their Arabidopsis counterpart to form heterologous protein kinase modules that activated both OsSOS1 and AtSOS1 and suppressed the salt sensitivity of sos2 and sos3 mutants of Arabidopsis
    + Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
