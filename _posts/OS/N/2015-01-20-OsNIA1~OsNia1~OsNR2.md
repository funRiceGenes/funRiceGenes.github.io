* **Key message**  
    + The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.
    + These properties enable indica OsNR2 to confer increased effective tiller number, grain yield and NUE on japonica rice, effects enhanced by interaction with an additionally introgressed indica OsNRT1
    + In consequence, indica OsNR2 provides an important breeding resource for the sustainable increases in japonica rice yields necessary for future global food security
    + In addition, the expression of OsNR2 was differentially regulated between the roots, stem, and leaf tissues, and between introgression lines
    + However, in the stem and leaves, OsNR2 was upregulated in the NR introgression lines, but downregulation in the NRT introgression lines
