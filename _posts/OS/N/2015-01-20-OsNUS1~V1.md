* **Key message**  
    + We report here the effects of v1 mutation on the expressions of plastid and nuclear genes during leaf development
    + This period coincides very closely with the leaf developmental stage (late P4) at which the V1 gene gives the signal that determines the virescent phenotype
    + A virescent gene V1 determines the expression timing of plastid genes for transcription/translation apparatus during early leaf development in rice
    + On the contrary, in the v1 seedlings grown at a restrictive temperature (20°C), this stage-specific accumulation of the rpo and rps transcripts was missing
    + The rice nuclear mutant, virescent-1 (v1), is temperature-conditional and develops chlorotic leaves when grown at restrictive temperatures
