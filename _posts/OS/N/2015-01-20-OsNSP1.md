    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2%5BTitle%5D), However, legume NSP1 and NSP2 can be functionally replaced by nonlegume orthologs, including rice (Oryza sativa) NSP1 and NSP2, indicating that both proteins are functionally conserved in higher plants
    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2%5BTitle%5D), Here, we show that NSP1 and NSP2 are indispensable for strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis in the legume Medicago truncatula and in rice
    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2%5BTitle%5D), The disturbed SL biosynthesis in nsp1 nsp2 mutant backgrounds correlates with reduced expression of DWARF27, a gene essential for SL biosynthesis
    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2%5BTitle%5D), Therefore, we conclude that regulation of SL biosynthesis by NSP1 and NSP2 is an ancestral function conserved in higher plants
    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2%5BTitle%5D), NSP1 and NSP2 are single-copy genes in legumes, which implies that both proteins fulfill dual regulatory functions to control downstream targets after rhizobium-induced signaling as well as SL biosynthesis in nonsymbiotic conditions
    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2%5BTitle%5D), Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2

    + __OsNSP1__, __OsNSP2__, [Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice%5BTitle%5D), Two GRAS-domain transcription factors, NSP1 and NSP2, have been shown to be required for RN symbiosis, but not for AM symbiosis
