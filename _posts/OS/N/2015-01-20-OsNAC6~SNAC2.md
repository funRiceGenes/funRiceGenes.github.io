* **Key message**  
    + Our results imply that OsNAC6, besides having a role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses, also integrates signals derived from both abiotic and biotic stresses
    + Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6 constitutively exhibited growth retardation and low reproductive yields
    + The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
    + Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings
    + These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
    + The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice
    + OsNAC6 was also induced by jasmonic acid (JA), a plant hormone that activates defense responses against herbivores and pathogens
    + Expression of OsNAC6 is induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, drought and high salinity
    + The growth of these plants was similar to that of control plants, whereas the growth of OsNAC6-overexpressing transgenic plants was retarded
    + Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different
    + These data suggest SNAC2 is a novel stress responsive NAC transcription factor that possesses potential utility in improving stress tolerance of rice
    + Characterization of transcription factor gene SNAC2 conferring cold and salt tolerance in rice
    + Northern blot and SNAC2 promoter activity analyses suggest that SNAC2 gene was induced by drought, salinity, cold, wounding, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + Here we show that OsNAC6 is induced by cold, salt, drought and abscisic acid (ABA)
    + By utilizing stress-inducible promoters, such as the OsNAC6 promoter, it is hoped that stress-inducible over-expression of OsNAC6 in rice can improve stress tolerance by suppressing the negative effects of OsNAC6 on growth under normal growth conditions
    + OsNAC6 gene expression is also induced by wounding and blast disease
    + The OsNAC6 gene is a member of the NAC transcription factor gene family in rice
    + Functional analysis of a NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC6 involved in abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gene expression in rice
    + The results of microarray analysis revealed that many genes that are inducible by abiotic and biotic stresses were upregulated in rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6
    + Collectively, these results indicate that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants
    + The rice OsNAC6 transcription factor orchestrates multiple molecular mechanisms involving root structural adaptions and nicotianamine biosynthesis for drought tolerance.
    + Multiyear drought field tests demonstrated that the grain yield of OsNAC6 root-specific overexpressing transgenic rice lines was less affected by drought stress than were non-transgenic controls
    + Collectively, OsNAC6 orchestrates novel molecular drought tolerance mechanisms and has potential for the biotechnological development of high-yielding crops under water limiting conditions
    + Genome-wide analyses of loss- and gain-of-function mutants revealed that OsNAC6 up-regulates the expression of direct target genes involved in membrane modification, nicotianamine (NA) biosynthesis, glutathione relocation, 3'-phophoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate accumulation, and glycosylation, which represent multiple drought tolerance pathways
