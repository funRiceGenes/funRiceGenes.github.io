## Expression information
__Expression__: Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants

2. __OsNF-YB1__, __OsSUT1__, [NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)), In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4
