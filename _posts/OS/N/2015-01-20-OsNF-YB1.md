* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptional profiling and promoter analysis revealed that OsNF-YB1 was highly expressed at the early stages of rice endosperm development (5-7 DAP, days after pollination)
    + Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm
    + Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants
    + Taken together, these results suggested that the endosperm-specific gene OsNF-YB1 might be a cell cycle regulator and played a role in maintaining the endosperm cell proliferation
    + NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm
    + Rice aleurone layer specific OsNF-YB1 regulates grain filling and endosperm development by interacting with an ERF transcription factor.
    + Knockdown of OsNF-YB1 expression by RNAi significantly retarded grain filling, leading to small grains with chalky endosperm as well as altered starch quality
    + RNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to membrane transport and ATP biosynthesis were enriched in the down-regulated category in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants, which is consistent with the crucial role of OsNF-YB1 in rice grain filling and endosperm development
    + It is proposed that OsNF-YB1 specifically regulate the transcription of downstream genes during rice endosperm development by forming protein complexes consisting of OsNF-YB1, OsNF-YC and ERF, providing informative insights into the molecular functional mechanisms of the NF-Y factor
    + Interestingly, different from the binding sites reported for other NF-Y complexes, the GCC box, the binding motif of ERF transcription factors, was enriched in the binding peaks of OsNF-YB1
    + Whereas OsNF-YB1 shows subcellular localization in both the cytosol and the nucleus in roots, it was specifically targeted to the nucleus of aleurone layer cells, which was facilitated by interacting with OsNF-YC proteins preferentially expressed in the aleurone layer
    + Identification of the genome-wide targets of OsNF-YB1 by ChIP sequencing showed that OsNF-YB1 directly regulates genes involved in the transport of nutrients such as sugar and amino acids
    + Seeds of osnf-yb1 and osbzip76 mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content.
    + Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of OsNF-YB1 and OsYUC11 during grain filling stage
