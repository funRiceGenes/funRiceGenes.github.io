* **Key message**  
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines
    + The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA
    + When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
    + These results suggest that the product of the novel gene, OsNHX1, functions as a Na+/H+ exchanger, and plays important roles in salt tolerance of rice
    + In addition, overexpression of OsNHX1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic rice cells and plants
    + These results suggest that OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts plays important roles in the compartmentation of Na(+) and K(+) highly accumulated in the cytoplasm into the vacuoles, and the amount of the antiporter is one of the most important factors determining salt tolerance in rice
    + OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
    + Treatment with high concentrations of NaCl and KCl increased the transcript levels of OsNHX1 in rice roots and shoots
    + It also shows that inclusion of the complete un-translated regions (UTRs) of the alternatively spliced OsNHX1 gene provides a higher level of tolerance to the transgenic rice
    + OsNHX1 overexpression in rice resulted in a decrease in ¦Ócl , and an increase in biomass, grain yield under drought
    + Taken together, the natural variation in OsNHX1 could be utilized to manipulate the stomatal dynamics for an improved rice drought tolerance
    + Herein, using genome-wide association study, we showed that the genetic variation in OsNHX1 was strongly associated with the changes in ¦Ócl , the time constant of stomatal closure, in 206 rice accessions
