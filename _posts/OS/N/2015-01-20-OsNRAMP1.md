* **Key message**  
    + Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice
    + The growth of yeast expressing OsNRAMP1 was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector
    + The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here
    + The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice
    + The expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki) regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki
    + These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots
    + Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only OsNRAMP1 is highly up-regulated by iron (Fe) deficiency
    + OsNRAMP1 expression was observed mainly in roots and was higher in the roots of a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than in those of a low-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki)
    + These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and that the differences observed in Cd accumulation among cultivars are because of differences in OsNRAMP1 expression levels in roots
    + Immunostaining showed that OsNRAMP1 was localized in all root cells except the central vasculature, and in leaf mesophyll cells
    + The knockout of OsNRAMP1 resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Cd and Mn and their accumulation in rice shoots and grains, and increased sensitivity to Mn deficiency
    + OsNRAMP1 contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice
    + Here, we showed that OsNRAMP1 was able to transport Cd and manganese (Mn) when expressed in yeast, but did not transport Fe or As
    + OsNRAMP1 was mainly expressed in roots and leaves and encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein
    + Previous studies reported that the rice OsNRAMP1 (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1) could transport iron (Fe), Cd and arsenic (As) in heterologous yeast assays
    + OsNRAMP1 expression was induced by Cd treatment and Fe deficiency
