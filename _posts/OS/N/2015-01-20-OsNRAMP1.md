2. __growth__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The growth of yeast expressing OsNRAMP1 was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector
3. __iron__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here

5. __transporter__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here
6. __transporter__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D), The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice
7. __root__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar Habataki than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar Sasanishiki regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki
8. __root__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots
9. __shoot__, [The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots
10. __transporter__, [Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only OsNRAMP1 is highly up-regulated by iron Fe deficiency
11. __transporter__, [Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D), Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice
12. __root__, [Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsNRAMP1 expression was observed mainly in roots and was higher in the roots of a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar Habataki than in those of a low-Cd-accumulating cultivar Sasanishiki)  
13. __root__, [Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and that the differences observed in Cd accumulation among cultivars are because of differences in OsNRAMP1 expression levels in roots
14. __iron__, [Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only OsNRAMP1 is highly up-regulated by iron Fe deficiency
