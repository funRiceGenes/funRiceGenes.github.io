* **Key message**  
    + Transcription factor OsNF-YB9 regulates reproductive growth and development in rice.
    + OsNF-YB9 interacted with MADS1, a key regulator of floral development
    + OsNF-YB9 overexpression also resulted in morphological defects in the reproductive organs and led to pseudovivipary
    + OsNF-YB9 delayed the heading date when ectopically expressed in rice
    + OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice (Oryza sativa)

    + __OsbZIP76__, __OsNF-YB9__, [OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  Oryza sativa.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsbZIP76 interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  Oryza sativa.%5BTitle%5D),  As a putative  transcription factor, OsbZIP76 alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta
