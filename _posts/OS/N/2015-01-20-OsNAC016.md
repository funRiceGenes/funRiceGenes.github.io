* **Key message**  
    + Further investigation revealed that OsNAC016 regulated the expression of the brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene D2 by binding to its promoter
    + Moreover, OsNAC016 interacted with and was phosphorylated by GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 (GSK2), a negative regulator in the BR pathway
    + OsNAC016 regulates plant architecture and drought tolerance by interacting with the kinases GSK2 and SAPK8.
    + Meanwhile, the mutant osnac016 had improved drought stress tolerance, supported by a decreased water loss rate and enhanced stomatal closure in response to exogenous ABA, but OsNAC016-overexpressing plants showed attenuated drought tolerance and reduced ABA sensitivity
    + Our findings establish that OsNAC016 is positively involved in BR-regulated rice architecture, negatively modulates ABA-mediated drought tolerance, and is regulated by GSK2, SAPK8, and OsPUB43 through post-translational modification
    + Further, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE8 (SAPK8) phosphorylated OsNAC016 and reduced its stability
    + The loss-of-function mutant osnac016 exhibited erect leaves and shortened internodes, but OsNAC016-overexpressing plants had opposite phenotypes
