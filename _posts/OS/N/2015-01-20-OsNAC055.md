    + Transcription factor OsNAC055 regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis in rice straw.
    + In this study, we identified a rice NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) transcription factor OsNAC055 that regulates GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis
    + As a nucleus-localized transcription factor, OsNAC055 exhibits the transcriptional activation activity
    + Together, our results provide the evidence that OsNAC055 functions as an essential transcription factor to regulate the GA-mediated lignin biosynthesis, which provides a strategy for manipulating lignin production
    + On the other hand, phytohormone measurement showed that OsNAC055 overexpression significantly increased exogenous GA3 levels in rice plants by regulating GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2
    + Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complement (BiFC) assays indicated that OsNAC055 interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), the repressor in GA signaling
    + Overexpression of OsNAC055 increases the lignin content in rice straw
    + Further ChIP-qPCR analysis and transient transactivation assays indicated that OsNAC055 directly activates rice lignin biosynthetic genes CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) and CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 2 (OsCAD2) by binding to their promoters
