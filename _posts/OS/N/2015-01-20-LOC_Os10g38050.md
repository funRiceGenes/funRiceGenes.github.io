* **Key message**  
    + The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions
    + OsNP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase regulating tapetum degeneration and pollen exine formation; it is specifically expressed in the tapetum and miscrospores
    + OsNP1 was coupled with an alpha-amylase gene to devitalize transgenic pollen and the red fluorescence protein (DsRed) gene to mark transgenic seed and transformed into the osnp1 mutant
