    + __OsNIA1~OsNia1~OsNR2__, __OsNIA2__, [New Insights into the Transcriptional Regulation of Genes Involved in the Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Potassium Chlorate in Rice  Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=New Insights into the Transcriptional Regulation of Genes Involved in the Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Potassium Chlorate in Rice  Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  In the same way, the expression patterns of OsNIA1 and OsNIA2 in the roots, stem, and leaves indicated a differential transcriptional regulation by KClO3, with OsNIA2 prevailing over OsNIA1 in the roots
    + __OsNIA2__, __RHS1__, [A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.%5BTitle%5D),  The expression levels of genes responsible for NO production (OsNIA1, OsNIA2, and OsNOA1) were lower in rhs1 plants than in WT plants under normal conditions
    + __OsNIA2__, __RHS1__, [A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.%5BTitle%5D),  However, under nitrosative stress, the expression of OsNIA2 significantly increased in rhs1 plants
    + __OsNIA1~OsNia1~OsNR2__, __OsNIA2__, [A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.%5BTitle%5D),  The expression levels of genes responsible for NO production (OsNIA1, OsNIA2, and OsNOA1) were lower in rhs1 plants than in WT plants under normal conditions
    + __OsNIA2__, __OsNOA1__, [A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.%5BTitle%5D),  The expression levels of genes responsible for NO production (OsNIA1, OsNIA2, and OsNOA1) were lower in rhs1 plants than in WT plants under normal conditions
