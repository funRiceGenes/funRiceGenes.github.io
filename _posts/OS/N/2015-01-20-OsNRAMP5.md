* **Key message**  
    + OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
    + The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation
    + Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
    + OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem
    + OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport
    + These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development
    + Hydroponic culture showed that Cd concentrations in shoots and roots of osnramp5 mutants were dramatically decreased, resulting in rescue of impaired growth in high Cd condition
    + Here, we report the development of new indica rice lines with low Cd accumulation and no transgenes by knocking out the metal transporter gene OsNramp5 using CRISPR/Cas9 system
    + In particular, the plant yield was not significantly affected in osnramp5 mutants
    + OsNramp5 is a key gene involved in the control of the uptake of Cd, Mn, and other metal ions by rice root cells
    + The determination of metal content and the statistics of related agronomic traits revealed that the functionally deficient OsNramp5 not only significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd in the grains of the mutants but also affected rice yield and quality
    + Additionally, we also found that the increase in the concentration of Mn in the soil restored the phenotype of the declined yield and quality due to the functional deficiency of OsNramp5
    + Mutation at Different Sites of Metal Transporter Gene OsNramp5 Affects Cd Accumulation and Related Agronomic Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + In the present study, three Huanghuazhan-based OsNramp5 mutants [LCH1 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 1), LCH2 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 2), and LCH3 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 3)] were obtained using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology
    + However, with the decrease of OsNramp5 mutation degree, its effects on chlorenchyma Mn accumulation, yield, and quality were also diminished
    + The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
    + Besides, OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots seemed more related to root Mn accumulation
    + At last, multi-level regulating and processing of the process from gene expression to protein translation might account for the inconsistent relationship between root OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots
    + Manganese (Mn) transporter OsNRAMP5 was widely reported to regulate cadmium (Cd) uptake in rice
    + The fact that function of OsNRAMP5 mainly focuses on Mn uptake, together with the fact that many transporter genes involved in Cd uptake might result in the insignificant correlation between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots
    + Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 decreased Cd translocation from roots to shoots by disrupting radial transport of Cd into the stele for xylem loading, demonstrating the effect of transporter localization and polarity on ion homeostasis
    + Overexpressed OsNRAMP5 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of all cell types in the root tips and lateral root primordia without polarity
    + Overexpression of the manganese/cadmium transporter OsNRAMP5 reduces cadmium accumulation in rice grain
    + When grown in three Cd-contaminated paddy soils, OsNRAMP5 overexpression decreased grain Cd concentration by 49-94% compared with wild type
    + The effect of OsNRAMP5 knockout on reducing root Cd uptake weakened, however its effect on improving root-to-shoot Cd translocation was constant with increasing environmental Cd concentrations
    + Knockout of OsNRAMP5 enhances rice tolerance to cadmium toxicity in response to varying external cadmium concentrations via distinct mechanisms.
    + It is vital to evaluate the effects of knocking out OsNRAMP5 on Cd and Mn accumulation, as well as Cd tolerance of rice plants in response to varying environmental Cd concentrations, and to uncover the underlying mechanism, which until now, has remained largely unexplored
    + OsNRAMP5 is a transporter responsible for cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of Mn in rice plants
    + Among several genes involved in rice Cd accumulation, the loss of function of OsNRAMP5 is known to be effective in reducing grain concentration by inhibiting root uptake
    + With the aim of improving Mn uptake in OsNRAMP5 mutants while still restricting the grain Cd concentration below the upper limit of international standards, we identified a novel OsNRAMP5 allele encoding a protein in which glutamine (Q) at position 337 was replaced by lysine (K)
    + However, disruption of this gene simultaneously decreases manganese (Mn) uptake because OsNRAMP5 is a major Mn transporter
    + A weak allele of OsNRAMP5 confers moderate cadmium uptake while avoiding manganese deficiency in rice.
    + Knockout of OsNRAMP5 in rice by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Pb and accumulation in rice shoots
    + When grown in Pb-contaminated paddy soil, OsNRAMP5 knockout mutants accumulated approximately 50 and 70% lower Pb concentrations in the grain and straw, respectively, than the wild type
    + OsNRAMP5 Is a Major Transporter for Lead Uptake in Rice.
    + These results indicate that OsNRAMP5 is a major transporter for Pb uptake in rice, in addition to its role in the uptake of manganese and cadmium
    + Higher expression of OsNramp5 increased uptake of Cd and Mn into the root cells but decreased Cd release to the xylem
