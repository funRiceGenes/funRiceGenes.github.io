## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
2. __shoot__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation
3. __root__, [Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
4. __transporter__, [Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
5. __xylem__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem
6. __xylem__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
7. __growth__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport
8. __growth__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development
9. __grain__, [Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
10. __root__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem
