* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, the photosystem of osnsun2 mutant was vulnerable to high ambient temperature and failed to undergo repair under tolerable heat stress
    + Thus, OsNSUN2 mutation reduced photosynthesis efficiency and accumulated excessive reactive oxygen species upon heat treatment
    + Herein, we identified OsNSUN2 as an RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferase in rice
