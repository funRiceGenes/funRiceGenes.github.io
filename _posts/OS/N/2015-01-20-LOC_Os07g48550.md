* **Key message**  
    + OsNAC15 is a functional transcription factor with transactivation and DNA binding activities
    + OsNAC15 expresses in all tissues of different developmental stages, and is repressed by Zn deficiency and induced by Cd stress
    + Expression analysis of rice ZIP family genes suggested that the knockout of OsNAC15 activates or inhibits their transcriptions under Zn deficiency or Cd stress conditions
    + OsNAC15 Regulates Tolerance to Zinc Deficiency and Cadmium by Binding to OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 in Rice.
    + Knockout of OsNAC15 reduced ZDT and CDT at the vegetative stage
    + The yeast one-hybrid assay, transient transcriptional activity assay using the dual-luciferase reporter system and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that OsNAC15 directly binds to the zinc deficiency-responsive element motifs in the promoters of OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 to repress their transcriptions
