* **Key message**  
    + Collectively, the blocking of OsCCD4a activity might have potential as a practical tool for enhancing the carotenoid level of the carotenoid-accumulating seed endosperms as well as leaves of rice plants
    + Overexpression of OsNCED1 improved the HS tolerance of rice at the heading and flowering stage
    + These results suggested that OsNCED1 overexpression can improve the heat tolerance of rice by enhancing the antioxidant capacity
