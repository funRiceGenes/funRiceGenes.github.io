* **Key message**  
    + Concurrent activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 in rice leads to enhanced nitrogen use efficiency under nitrogen limitation.
    + Combining OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 activation then provides a good breeding strategy for improving plant growth, nitrogen use efficiency and grain productivity especially under nitrogen limitation through the increment of both nitrogen uptake and assimilation
    + We show that the double activation of OsAMT1;2 and OsGOGAT1 increases plant performance in agriculture, providing better N grain filling without yield penalty under paddy field conditions, and better grain yield and N content when plants are grown under N-limiting in field conditions
