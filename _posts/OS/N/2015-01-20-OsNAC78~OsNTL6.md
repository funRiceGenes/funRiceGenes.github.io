* **Key message**  
    + OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER
    + OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants
    + OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain
