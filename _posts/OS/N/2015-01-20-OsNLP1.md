* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsNLP1 improves plant growth, grain yield and NUE under different N conditions while knockout of OsNLP1 impairs grain yield and NUE under N limiting conditions
    + Therefore, our results demonstrate that OsNLP1 is a key regulator of N utilization and represents a potential target for improving NUE and yield in rice
    + OsNLP1 protein localizes in nucleus and its transcript level is rapidly induced by N starvation
    + OsNLP1 regulates nitrate and ammonium utilization by cooperatively orchestrating multiple N uptake and assimilation genes
