    + Symbol: OsNIN1  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g20020](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g20020)

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Analyses using five types of web software for the prediction of protein localization in the cell, Predotar, PSORT, Mitoprot, TargetP, and ChloroP, strongly supported the possibility that OsNIN1 is transported into the mitochondria and that OsNIN3 is transported into plastids
    + Transient expression of fusion proteins combining the amino terminal region of these two proteins with sGFP demonstrated that N-OsNIN1::GFP and N-OsNIN3::GFP fusion proteins were transported into the mitochondria and plastids, respectively
