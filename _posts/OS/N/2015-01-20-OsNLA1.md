* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we found that the Oryza sativa (rice) ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana Nitrogen Limitation Adaptation (NLA), OsNLA1 protein, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase, was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane, and could interact with rice phosphate transporters OsPT2 and OsPT8
    + Overexpression of OsNLA1 or repression of OsPT2/PT8 restored the high leaf Pi concentration in osnla1 mutants to a level similar to that of wild type plants
    + Our results show that OsNLA1 is involved in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice by mediating the degradation of OsPT2 and OsPT8, and OsNLA1 differs from the ortholog in Arabidopsis in several aspects
    + Mutation in OsNLA1 (osnla1) led to significant increase of Pi concentration in leaves in a nitrate-independent manner
    + In contrast to what has been observed in Arabidopsis, the transcript abundance of OsNLA1 did not decrease under Pi limited conditions or in OsmiR827 (microRNA827)- or OsPHR2 (PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2)-overexpressing transgenic lines
    + When grown under limiting nitrate levels, OsNLA1 transgenic lines also displayed a similar pattern in Pi accumulation and Pi toxicity symptoms compared to wild-type suggesting an existence of cross-talk between nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), which is regulated by OsNLA1
    + When grown under sufficient Pi and nitrate levels, OsNLA1 knockdown (Osnla1-1, Osnla1-2, and Osnla1-3) lines accumulated higher Pi content in their shoot tissues compared to wild-type, whereas, over-expression lines (OsNLA1-OE1, OsNLA1-OE2, and OsNLA1-OE3) accumulated the least levels of Pi
    + Taken together, these results show that OsNLA1 is involved in Pi homeostasis regulating Pi uptake and accumulation in rice plants and may provide an opportunity to enhance P use efficiency by manipulating nitrate supply in the soil
    + Altered Expression of OsNLA1 Modulates Pi Accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Plants.
    + Moreover, OsNLA1 was also found to interact with OsPHO2, a known regulator of Pi homeostasis, in a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay
    + In this study, by using transgenic approaches, we have revealed the critical role of OsNLA1 in phosphate (Pi) accumulation of rice plants
    + Loss-of-function of OsNLA1 caused P overaccumulation and growth inhibitions in both root and shoot under Pi-sufficient condition
    + Furthermore, mutation of OsNLA1 affected expression of Pi tranporters and root hair development under Pi-sufficient and/or Pi-deficient conditions
    + OsNLA1 plays a key role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice
    + Characterization of the rice NLA family reveals a key role for OsNLA1 in phosphate homeostasis.
    + Combining OsNLA1 mutation with OsPT8 overexpression resulted in As(V) hypersensitivity, As hyperaccumulation, and higher shoot to root ratio of As in rice
    + The role of OsNLA1 in regulating arsenate uptake and tolerance in rice.
    + In this study, the role of OsNLA1 in arsenate uptake and tolerance in rice was analyzed
    + OsNLA1 expression was induced in response to As(V) stress
    + The osnla1 mutant was more sensitive to As(V) stress than those of the wild type (WT)
    + These results indicated that OsNLA1 plays an important role in arsenate uptake and tolerance, mainly via regulating the amount of Pi transporters
    + OsNLA1 promoter activity was observed in roots, ligules, leaves, sheaths, pollen grains, and surrounding the vascular tissues of anthers, suggesting that OsNLA1 is important throughout the development of rice
    + Disruption of OsNLA1 resulted in increased Pi uptake from roots as well as impaired pollen development and reduced grain production
    + In summary, our study reveals that Pi-induced OsNLA1 expression regulated by a unique mechanism functions in Pi acquisition, Pi translocation, and reproductive success
    + uORF and Phosphate-Regulated Expression of Rice OsNLA1 Controls Phosphate Transport and Reproduction.
    + Rice (Oryza sativa) OsNLA1 has been proposed to play a crucial role in regulating phosphate (Pi) acquisition in roots, similar to that of Arabidopsis AtNLA
    + However, unlike AtNLA, OsNLA1 is not a target of miR827, a Pi starvation-induced miRNA
    + It is, therefore, of interest to know whether the expression of OsNLA1 depends on Pi supply and how it is regulated
    + In this study, we provide evidence that OsNLA1 controls Pi acquisition by directing the degradation of several OsPHT1 Pi transporters (i
