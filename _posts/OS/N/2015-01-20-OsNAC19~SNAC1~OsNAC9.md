* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C
    + The expression of OsNAC19 in rice leaves could be induced by the infection of blast fungus, and by application of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ABA and ethylene but ethylene had a relatively weak induction effect
    + The expression of gene OsNAC19 was high in rice seedling roots, culms and blade sheathes, but its expression in rice leaves was low
    + Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response
    + The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST
    + The SNAC1-targeted gene OsSRO1c modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice
    + Such up-regulated genes that are commonly and specifically up-regulated in OsNAC9 transgenic roots may account for the altered root architecture conferring increased drought resistance phenotype
    + The overexpression of OsNAC9 alters the root architecture of rice plants enhancing drought resistance and grain yield under field conditions
    + Under drought conditions, RCc3:OsNAC9 plants showed an increased grain yield of 28%-72%, whilst the GOS2:OsNAC9 plants remained unchanged
    + The aerenchyma of RCc3:OsNAC9 roots was enlarged to a greater extent than those of GOS2:OsNAC9 and non-transgenic (NT) roots, suggesting the importance of this phenotype for enhanced drought resistance
    + Field evaluations over two cultivating seasons showed that grain yields of the RCc3:OsNAC9 and the GOS2:OsNAC9 plants were increased by 13%-18% and 13%-32% under normal conditions, respectively
    + Here, we show that overexpression of stress responsive gene SNAC1 (STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC 1) significantly enhances drought resistance in transgenic rice (22-34% higher seed setting than control) in the field under severe drought stress conditions at the reproductive stage while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty
    + The OsSKIPa-overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress-related genes, including SNAC1 and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions
    + Our data suggest that SNAC1 holds promising utility in improving drought and salinity tolerance in rice
    + In this research, a full-length cDNA clone OsNAC19 (Oryza sativa NAC19), encoding a novel NAC-domain protein, was isolated from a cDNA library prepared with rice leaves infected by incompatible race 131 of blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea)
    + SNAC1 is induced predominantly in guard cells by drought and encodes a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor with transactivation activity
    + Root-specific (RCc3) and constitutive (GOS2) promoters were used to overexpress OsNAC9 and produced the transgenic RCc3:OsNAC9 and GOS2:OsNAC9 plants
    + Interestingly, O-methyltransferase, a gene necessary for barrier formation, was specifically up-regulated only in the RCc3:OsNAC9 roots
    + Rice gene OsNAC19 encodes a novel NAC-domain transcription factor and responds to infection by Magnaporthe grisea
    + A stress-responsive NAC transcription factor gene SNAC1 has been reported for its function in the positive regulation of drought resistance in rice, and several downstream SNAC1 targets have been identified
    + However, a complete regulatory network mediated by SNAC1 in drought response remains unknown
    + In this study, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq of SNAC1-overexpression transgenic rice (SNAC1-OE) lines and wild-type under normal and moderate drought stress conditions, to identify all SNAC1 target genes at a genome-wide scale by RNA-Seq analyses
    + SNAC1 can bind to the OsbZIP23 promoter, an important ABA signaling regulator, and positively regulate the expression of several ABA signaling genes
