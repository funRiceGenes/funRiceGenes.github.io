* **Key message**  
    + Aluminum stress specifically and quickly induced OsNIP1;2 expression in the root
    + Moreover, the Osnip1;2 mutants had considerably more Al accumulated in the root cell wall but less in the cytosol than the wild-type rice
    + In addition, compared with the wild-type rice plants, the Osnip1;2 mutants contained more Al in the root but less in the shoot
    + These results suggest that OsNIP1;2 confers internal Al detoxification via taking out the root cell wall&#x27;s Al, sequestering it to the root cell&#x27;s vacuole, and re-distributing it to the above-ground tissues
    + The plasma membrane-localized OsNIP1;2 mediates internal aluminum detoxification in rice.
