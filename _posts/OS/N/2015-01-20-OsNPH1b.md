## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: These results lead us to conclude that expression of OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b is differently photoregulated in different tissues of rice seedlings  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __seedlings__, [Rice NPH1 homologues, OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b, are differently photoregulated.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NPH1 homologues, OsNPH1a and OsNPH1b, are differently photoregulated.%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis showed that OsNPH1a was strongly expressed in coleoptiles, whereas OsNPH1b was highly expressed in leaves of dark-grown rice seedlings
