* **Key message**  
    + Variation in NRT1.1B contributes to nitrate-use divergence between rice subspecies
    + Here we show that variation in a nitrate-transporter gene, NRT1.1B (OsNPF6.5), may contribute  to this divergence in nitrate use.
    + NRT1.1B is associated with root microbiota composition and nitrogen use in field-grown rice.
