* **Key message**  
    + The improved growth and early-flowering phenotypes and the upregulation of early-flowering genes in OsNRT1.1A-OE plants are consistent with the results from the osnrt1.1a mutant, which collectively demonstrated that OsNRT1.1A plays important roles in promoting both N utilization and flowering.
