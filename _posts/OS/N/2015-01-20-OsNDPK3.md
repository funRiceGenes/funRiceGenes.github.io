## Expression information

## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (OsNDPK1) in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (OsNDPK1) in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens%5BTitle%5D)),  Three different programs for predicting subcellular targeting indicated that OsNDPK1 and NP922751 were non-organellar, OsNDPK2 plastidic, and OsNDPK3 mitochondrial
2. __mitochondria__, [Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice (Oryza sativaL.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice (Oryza sativaL.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol
