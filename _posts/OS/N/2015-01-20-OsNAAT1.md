* **Key message**  
    + In the present study, we identified six rice NAAT genes (OsNAAT1-6) by screening a cDNA library made from Fe-deficient rice roots and by searching databases
    + Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that OsNAAT1, but not OsNAAT2-6, was strongly up-regulated by Fe deficiency, both in roots and shoots
    + Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAAT1 was expressed in companion and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem of Fe-sufficient roots
    + OsNAAT1 expression was also observed in the companion cells of Fe-sufficient shoots, and was clearly induced in all the cells of Fe-deficient leaves
