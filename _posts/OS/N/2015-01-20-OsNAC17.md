* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsNAC17 is localized to the nucleus, and its expression was significantly induced under drought conditions
    + Together, our results show that OsNAC17 contributes to drought tolerance through lignin biosynthesis in rice
    + Further investigation revealed that OsNAC17 positively regulates several lignin biosynthetic genes and promotes lignin accumulation in leaves and roots
    + A transactivation assay in yeast revealed that the OsNAC17 is a transcriptional activator, harboring an activation domain in the C-terminal region
