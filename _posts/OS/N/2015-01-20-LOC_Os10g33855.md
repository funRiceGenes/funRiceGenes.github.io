* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of OsNBL1 resulted in accelerated dark-induced leaf senescence, accompanied by a reduction in chlorophyll content and up-regulation of several senescence-associated genes
    + OsNBL1 is a multi-organelle localized protein and interacts with OsClpP6, which is associated with senescence
    + Plants overexpressing OsNBL1 showed delayed dark-induced senescence, consistent with a higher chlorophyll content compared to wild-type plants
