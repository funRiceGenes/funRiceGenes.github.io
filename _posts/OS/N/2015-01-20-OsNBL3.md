* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsNBL3  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os03g06370](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g06370)  
    + RAPdb: [Os03g0159700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0159700)  

* **Publication**  
    + [OsNBL3, a mitochondrion-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein, is involved in splicing nad5 intron 4 and its disruption causes lesion mimic phenotype with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsNBL3, a mitochondrion-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein, is involved in splicing nad5 intron 4 and its disruption causes lesion mimic phenotype with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses%5BTitle%5D), 2021, Plant Biotechnol J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + RNA interference lines of OsNBL3 exhibited enhanced disease resistance similar to that of nbl3, while the disease resistance in overexpression lines did not differ from that of the wild type
    + Overall, the results demonstrated that the PPR protein-coding gene OsNBL3 is essential for mitochondrial development and functions, and its disruption causes the lesion mimic phenotype and enhances disease resistance and tolerance to salt in rice
