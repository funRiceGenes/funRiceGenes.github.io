* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, OsNINJA1 negatively affected JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence conditions
    + The expression of OsNINJA1 was upregulated at an early phase after JA treatment, and OsNINJA1 interacted with several OsJAZ proteins in a C domain-dependent manner
    + These results indicate that OsNINJA1 acts as a negative regulator of OsMYC2-mediated JA signaling in rice
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNINJA1 exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype and were more susceptible to rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv
