* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrated that OsNAC109 is essential to rice leaf senescence, growth and development through and phytohormone-associated genes in rice
    + OsNAC109 regulates senescence, growth and development by altering the expression of and phytohormone-associated genes in rice.
    + We demonstrate that OsNAC109 regulates senescence, growth and development via binding to the cis-element CNTCSSNNSCAVG and altering the expression of multiple and hormone-associated genes in rice
    + YL3 was expressed in all tissues tested and predicted to encode a transcriptional factor OsNAC109 which localizes to the nucleus
