1. __leaf__, [Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice Oryza sativaL.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice Oryza sativaL.%5BTitle%5D),  Expression analysis indicated that all the OsNDPKs are expressed in the leaf, leaf sheath, and immature seeds, except for OsNDPK1, in the leaf sheath
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 OsNDPK1 in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 OsNDPK1 in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens%5BTitle%5D),  OsNDPK1 gene expression was also strongly induced in response to exposure to salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid, although the level of transcripts and their pattern of expression depended on the inducer
3. __mitochondria__, [Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 OsNDPK1 in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Enhanced expression of a gene encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 OsNDPK1 in rice plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens%5BTitle%5D),  Three different programs for predicting subcellular targeting indicated that OsNDPK1 and NP922751 were non-organellar, OsNDPK2 plastidic, and OsNDPK3 mitochondrial
4. __mitochondria__, [Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice Oryza sativaL.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice Oryza sativaL.%5BTitle%5D),  Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol
5. __seed__, [Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice Oryza sativaL.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Three Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Isozymes from Rice Oryza sativaL.%5BTitle%5D),  Expression analysis indicated that all the OsNDPKs are expressed in the leaf, leaf sheath, and immature seeds, except for OsNDPK1, in the leaf sheath
