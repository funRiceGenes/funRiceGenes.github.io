* **Key message**  
    + Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions
    + However, OsNCED5 overexpression increased ABA level, enhanced tolerance to the stresses, and accelerated leaf senescence
    + Additionally, ectopic expression of OsNCED5 tested in Arabidopsis thaliana altered plant size and leaf morphology and delayed seed germination and flowering time
    + Thus, OsNCED5 may regulate plant development and stress resistance through control of ABA biosynthesis
    + Transcript analysis showed that OsNCED5 regulated ABA-dependent abiotic stress and senescence-related gene expression
