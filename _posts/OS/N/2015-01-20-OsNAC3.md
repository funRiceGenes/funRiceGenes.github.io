* **Key message**  
    + A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.
    + Immunostaining showed that OsNAC3 was localized in all root cells
    + RESULTS: In this study, we functionally characterized a rice NAC TF OsNAC3 for its involvement in ABA response and salt tolerance
    + OsNAC3 knockout decreased rice plants&#39; sensitivity to ABA but increased salt stress sensitivity, while OsNAC3 overexpression showed an opposite effect
    + Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21
    + CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that rice OsNAC3 is an important regulatory factor in ABA signal response and salt tolerance
    + ABA and NaCl treatment induced OsNAC3 expression in roots
