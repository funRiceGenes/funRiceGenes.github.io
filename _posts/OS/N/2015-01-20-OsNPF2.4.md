* **Key message**  
    + Rice nitrate transporter OsNPF2.4 functions in low-affinity acquisition and long-distance transport
    + In this study, we showed that rice OsNPF2.4 is located in the plasma membrane and is expressed mainly in the epidermis, xylem parenchyma, and phloem companion cells
    + Functional analysis in oocytes showed that OsNPF2.4 is a pH-dependent, low-affinity NO3- transporter.
