* **Key message**  
    + Five transcription factors (TFs) belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) were identified as binding to OsNHX1 promoter
    + Here we report that the OsNLP3 (NIN-like protein 3) regulates NUE and grain yield in rice under N sufficient conditions
    + Loss-of-function of OsNLP3 reduces plant growth, grain yield, and NUE under sufficient nitrate conditions, whereas under low nitrate or different ammonium conditions, osnlp3 mutants show no clear difference from the wild type
    + Importantly, under sufficient N conditions in the field, OsNLP3 overexpression lines display improved grain yield and NUE compared with the wild type
    + Therefore, OsNLP3 is a promising candidate gene for the genetic improvement of grain yield and NUE in rice
    + OsNLP3 transcript level is significantly induced by N starvation and its protein nucleocytosolic shuttling is specifically regulated by nitrate
