* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified and characterized a WRKY transcription factor in rice, OsWRKY50
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that rice transcription repressor OsWRKY50 mediates ABA-dependent seed germination and seedling growth and enhances salt stress tolerance via an ABA-independent pathway
    + Rice OsWRKY50 Mediates ABA-Dependent Seed Germination and Seedling Growth, and ABA-Independent Salt Stress Tolerance
    + The transcription of OsWRKY50 was repressed under salt stress conditions, but activated after abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + OsWRKY50 functions as a transcriptional repressor in the nucleus

    + __OsNCED5__, __OsWRKY50__, [Rice OsWRKY50 Mediates ABA-Dependent Seed Germination and Seedling Growth, and ABA-Independent Salt Stress Tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice OsWRKY50 Mediates ABA-Dependent Seed Germination and Seedling Growth, and ABA-Independent Salt Stress Tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  The protoplast-based transient expression system and yeast hybrid assay demonstrated that OsWRKY50 directly binds to the promoter of OsNCED5, and thus further inhibits its transcription
