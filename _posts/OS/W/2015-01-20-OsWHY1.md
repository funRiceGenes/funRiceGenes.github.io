* **Key message**  
    + OsWHY1 Interacts with OsTRX z and is Essential for Early Chloroplast Development in Rice.
    + What&#x27;s more, OsWHY1 was found to be preferentially expressed in young leaves and was involved in chloroplast RNA editing and splicing
    + Mutation of OsWHY1 significantly affected the expression of chloroplast and ribosome development-related and chlorophyll synthesis-related genes
    + In conclusion, OsWHY1 contributes to early chloroplast development and normal seedling survival in rice
