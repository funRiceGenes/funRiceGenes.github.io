* **Key message**  
    + Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance
    + In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream
