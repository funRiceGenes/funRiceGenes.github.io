## Expression information

## Key message
1. __ethylene__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway
3. __gibberellin__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  By contrast, gibberellin suppressed the expression of OsWRKY82
4. __abiotic stress__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D), " These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway"
5. __salinity__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D), " Additionally, OsWRKY82 transcripts could be induced by wounding and heat shocking, but not by abscisic acid, cold, high salinity and dehydration"
6. __defense response__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D), " These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway"
7. __flower__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  The transcript level of OsWRKY82 was relatively higher in stems, leaves, and flowers, and less abundant in grains
8. __defense__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D), " These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway"
9. __jasmonic__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway
10. __grain__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D),  The transcript level of OsWRKY82 was relatively higher in stems, leaves, and flowers, and less abundant in grains
11. __biotic stress__, [Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and Expression Patterns of Rice WRKY82 Transcription Factor Gene Responsive to Both Biotic and Abiotic Stresses%5BTitle%5D), " These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway"
