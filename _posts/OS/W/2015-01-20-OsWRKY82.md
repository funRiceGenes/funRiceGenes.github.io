* **Key message**  
    + These indicate that OsWRKY82 is a multiply stress-inducible gene responding to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and may be involved in the regulation of defense response to pathogens and tolerance against abiotic stresses by jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway
    + By contrast, gibberellin suppressed the expression of OsWRKY82
    + Additionally, OsWRKY82 transcripts could be induced by wounding and heat shocking, but not by abscisic acid, cold, high salinity and dehydration
    + The transcript level of OsWRKY82 was relatively higher in stems, leaves, and flowers, and less abundant in grains
    + The expression of OsWRKY82 was up-regulated by methyl jasmonate and ethephon, whereas salicylic acid exerted no effects on its expression
