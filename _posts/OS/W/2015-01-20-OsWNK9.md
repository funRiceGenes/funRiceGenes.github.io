* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to salt and drought stress.
    + The transcript analysis revealed that OsWNK9 was strongly down regulated under salinity, drought and ABA stress in shoots
    + The results indicated that OsWNK9 may regulate salt and drought response in ABA dependent manner
    + Constitutive expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis thaliana imparted increased tolerance to salt, drought, and ABA stress
    + Subcellular localization studies of OsWNK9 showed their presence in the nucleus
    + Co-expression analysis of OsWNK9 in phosphate deficiency and arsenate stress condition predicted various proteins including membrane transporter and transcription factors
    + Protein-protein interaction analysis of OsWNK9 predicted interaction partners with protein kinase and oxidative stress-responsive protein
    + Overexpression of rice OsWNK9 promotes arsenite tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants
    + Taken together, our results, for the first time, provide evidence that OsWNK9 could positively mediate arsenite stress tolerance in plants
    + In the present study, we have characterized Arabidopsis overexpressed lines of OsWNK9 regulated by the constitutive promoter under arsenite stress
    + Moreover, we have performed In silico expression analysis of OsWNK9 under nutrient deficiency and heavy metal stress
