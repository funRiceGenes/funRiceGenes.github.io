* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to salt and drought stress.
    + The transcript analysis revealed that OsWNK9 was strongly down regulated under salinity, drought and ABA stress in shoots
    + The results indicated that OsWNK9 may regulate salt and drought response in ABA dependent manner
    + Constitutive expression of OsWNK9 in Arabidopsis thaliana imparted increased tolerance to salt, drought, and ABA stress
    + Subcellular localization studies of OsWNK9 showed their presence in the nucleus
