* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsWRKY67 in rice confirmed enhanced disease resistance, but led to a restriction of plant growth in transgenic lines with high levels of OsWRKY67 protein
    + OsWRKY67 Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice.
    + Activation of OsWRKY67 by T-DNA tagging significantly improved the resistance against two rice pathogens, Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + OsWRKY67 RNAi lines significantly reduced resistance to M
    + oryzae and Xoo isolates tested, and abolished XA21-mediated resistance, implying the possibility of broad-spectrum resistance from OsWRKY67
    + Therefore, these results suggest that OsWRKY67 positively regulates basal and XA21-mediated resistance, and is a promising candidate for genetic improvement of disease resistance in rice
    + Transcriptional activity and subcellular localization assays indicated that OsWRKY67 is present in the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional activator
    + Reactive oxygen species (ROS) rapidly accumulated in OsWRKY67 activation mutant lines in response to elicitor treatment, compared with the controls
    + Here, we identified that the transcription of OsWRKY67 was strongly activated by leaf and panicle blast infection
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsWRKY67 showed quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight
    + These results together suggest the positive role of OsWRKY67 in regulating rice responses to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight disease
    + OsWRKY67 positively regulates blast and bacteria blight resistance by direct activation of PR genes in rice.
    + RNA-seq analysis indicated that OsWRKY67 induces the transcription of a set of defense-related genes including the ones involved in the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent pathway
    + In contrast, silencing of OsWRKY67 increased the susceptibility to blast and bacterial blight diseases
    + OsWRKY67 is ubiquitously expressed and sub-localized in the nucleus
