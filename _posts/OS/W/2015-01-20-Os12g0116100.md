* **Key message**  
    + When OsWRKY114 is overexpressed in transgenic plants they show enhanced disease resistance against Xoo compared with wild types
    + These results suggest that OsWRKY114 enhances the innate immunity of Asian rice against Xoo through direct activation of defense genes that include OsPR1a and chtinase
    + OsWRKY114 has transcriptional activity in yeast and localizes in the nucleus
    + This is the first report to functionally characterize OsWRKY114 in Xoo infection
    + When OsWRKY114 is overexpressed in transgenic plants they show enhanced disease and cell-based functional analyses, we showed OsWRKY114 directly associates with the promoters of OsPR1a and Chitinase and increases the promoter activities
    + The WRKY Group III transcription factor OsWRKY114 is a positive regulator of innate immunity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + OsWRKY114 Negatively Regulates Drought Tolerance by Restricting Stomatal Closure in Rice.
    + In this study, we showed that the abundant OsWRKY114 transcripts present in transgenic rice plants are reduced under drought conditions
    + The overexpression of OsWRKY114 significantly increased drought sensitivity in rice, which resulted in a lower survival rate after drought stress
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsWRKY114 negatively regulates plant tolerance to drought stress via inhibition of stomatal closure, which would otherwise prevent water loss in rice
    + In this study, we revealed that OsWRKY114 is involved in the ABA response during Xoo infection
    + OsWRKY114 attenuated the negative effect of ABA on salicylic acid-dependent immunity
    + Furthermore, OsWRKY114 decreased the transcript levels of ABA-associated genes involved in ABA response and biosynthesis
    + Taken together, our results suggest that OsWRKY114 is a negative regulator of ABA that confers susceptibility to Xoo in rice
    + These results indicate that OsWRKY114 confers broad-spectrum resistance not only to Xoo but also to F
    + In this study, we revealed that OsWRKY114 enhances innate immunity in rice against the fungal pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi, which is the causal agent of bakanae disease
    + However, it is not known whether OsWRKY114 is involved in defense responses to other pathogens
    + OsWRKY114 Is a Player in Rice Immunity against Fusarium fujikuroi.
