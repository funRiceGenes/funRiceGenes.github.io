* **Key message**  
    + The transcription factor OsWRKY28 acts as a negative regulator of basal resistance, like the orthologous barley gene
    + In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the role of one of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice, OsWRKY28, in the regulation of basal defense responses to a compatible race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, strain Ina86-137
    + Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction of several defense-related genes in the wild type after Ina86-137 infection was counteracted in OsWRKY28-overexpressing rice plants
    + These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY28 is a negative regulator of basal defense responses against Ina86-137 and acts as a modulator to maintain the responses at an appropriate level by attenuating the activation of defense-related gene expression levels
    + The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76
    + Here, we report that a large inverted repeat construct designed to knock down the expression of the four OsWRKY IIa subfamily members (OsWRKY62, OsWRKY28, OsWRKY71, and OsWRKY76) leads to overexpression of all four genes and disease resistance in some transgenic plants
    + OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus
    + OsWRKY28 Regulates Phosphate and Arsenate Accumulation, Root System Architecture and Fertility in Rice.
    + Exogenous JA treatments mimicked the phenotypes of the oswrky28 mutants with inhibited root elongation and decreased arsenate/phosphate translocation
    + Our results suggested that OsWRKY28 affected arsenate/phosphate accumulation, root development at the seedling stage and fertility at the reproductive stage possibly by influencing homeostasis of JA or other phytohormones
    + The expression of OsWRKY28 was markedly induced by arsenate and other oxidative stresses
    + In a hydroponic experiment, loss-of-function mutation in OsWRKY28 resulted in lower accumulation of arsenate and phosphate concentration in the shoots
