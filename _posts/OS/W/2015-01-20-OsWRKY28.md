## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Building a mutant resource for the study of disease resistance in rice reveals the pivotal role of several genes involved in defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Building a mutant resource for the study of disease resistance in rice reveals the pivotal role of several genes involved in defence%5BTitle%5D),  The transcription factor OsWRKY28 acts as a negative regulator of basal resistance, like the orthologous barley gene
