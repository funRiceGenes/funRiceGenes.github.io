* **Key message**  
    + Only the LOC_Os07g27670 expression level encoding the OsWRKY115 transcription factor on the locus was specifically induced by cold stress in the cold-tolerant cultivar
    + Overexpression and knockout of OsWRKY115 significantly affected cold tolerance in seedlings
    + OsWRKY115 on qCT7 links to cold tolerance in rice.
    + Moreover, haplotype analysis and the KASP8 marker indicated that OsWRKY115 was significantly associated with cold tolerance
    + Our experiments identified OsWRKY115 as a novel regulatory gene associated with cold response in rice, and the Kong-Yu-131 allele with specific cold-induced expression may be an important molecular variant
