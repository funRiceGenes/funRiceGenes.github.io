* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues and was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment
    + Thus, our study suggests that OsWRKY63 negatively regulates chilling tolerance in a model of the OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B transcriptional regulatory cascade in rice
    + OsWRKY63 localized in the nucleus plays a role as a transcription repressor and downregulates many cold stress-related genes and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes

    + __OsWRKY63__, __OsWRKY76__, [The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B module regulates chilling tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Molecular, biochemical, and genetic assays showed that OsWRKY76 is a direct target gene of OsWRKY63 and that its expression was suppressed by OsWRKY63
