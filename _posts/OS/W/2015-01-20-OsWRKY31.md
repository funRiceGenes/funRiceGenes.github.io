3. __auxin__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene OsWRKY31 that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin
4. __auxin__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport
5. __auxin__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice
6. __auxin__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D), Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants
7. __growth__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D), Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants
8. __disease resistance__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D), Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants
9. __blast__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene OsWRKY31 that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin
10. __defense response__, [Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice
