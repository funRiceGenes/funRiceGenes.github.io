* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsWOX13 (OsWOX13-ov) in rice under the rab21 promoter resulted in drought resistance and early flowering by 7-10 days
    + These results suggest that OsWOX13 mediates the stress response and early flowering and, thus, may be a regulator of genes involved in drought escape
    + OsWOX13<U+00A0>was regulated spatially in vegetative organs but temporally in flowers and seeds
