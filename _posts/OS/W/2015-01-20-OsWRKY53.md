* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY53, a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-responsive rice WRKY gene, has been found to be involved in defense responses in rice
    + Promoter Analysis of the Elicitor-Induced WRKY GeneOsWRKY53, Which Is Involved in Defense Responses in Rice
    + We identified three tandem W-box elements, putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements that are essential to the elicitor-responsiveness of OsWRKY53 by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay
    + OsWRKY53 was also induced in suspension-cultured rice cells by a fungal cerebroside elicitor and in rice plants by infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea
    + A microarray analysis revealed that several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes such as PBZ1, were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY53
    + These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY53 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in elicitor-induced defense signaling pathways in rice
    + Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53 in the expression of defense-related genes in rice
    + Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice
    + Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
    + OsWRKY53 is also shown to be a negative regulator of plant growth
    + The transcript levels of OsWRKY53 are independent of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA), but positively regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), OsMPK3/OsMPK6
    + Recently, a rice WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY53 has been reported to function as a negative feedback modulator of OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and thereby to control the size of the investment a rice plant makes to defend against a chewing herbivore, the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis
    + We investigated the performance of a piecing-sucking herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, on transgenic plants that silence or overexpress OsWRKY53, and found that OsWRKY53 activates rice defenses against BPH by activating an H2O2 burst and suppressing ethylene biosynthesis
