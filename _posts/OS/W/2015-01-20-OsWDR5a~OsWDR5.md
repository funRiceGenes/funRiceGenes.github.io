* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Plants in which OsWDR5a or OsTrx1 expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain, and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of OsWDR5a function resulted in embryo lethality
    + OsWDR5a binds to Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels
