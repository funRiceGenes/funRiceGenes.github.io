* **Key message**  
    + Altogether, OsBWMK1 may mediate SA-dependent defense responses by activating the WRKY transcription factor in plants
    + OsBWMK1 mediates SA-dependent defense responses by activating the transcription factor OsWRKY33
    + Furthermore, the levels of SA and H(2)O(2) are elevated in 35S-OsBWMK1 transgenic plants that show HR-like cell death
    + Moreover, treatment with defense signaling related molecules, such as H(2)O(2) and SA, induced translocation of OsBWMK1 isoforms from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
    + In a previous study, we demonstrated that OsBWMK1, which localizes in the nucleus, mediates PR gene expression by activating the OsEREBP1 transcription factor, and that the constitutive expression of OsBWMK1 also enhances resistance against pathogen infections [Y
    + Furthermore, the expression of pOsBWMK1S::GUS was upregulated in response to hydrogen peroxide, a plant defense signaling molecule, in both plant species
