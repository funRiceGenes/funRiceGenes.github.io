    + The WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY54 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance in Rice.
    + This study reports the need for an uncharacterized WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY54 for rice salt-tolerance
    + Salt stress resulted in a rapid induction of OsWRKY54 expression in roots
    + The loss of OsWRKY54 resulted in greater Na accumulation in shoots and enhanced sensitivity of rice plants to salt stress
    + The real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and transcriptome analysis revealed that OsWRKY54 regulated the expression of some essential genes related to salt tolerance, such as OsNHX4 and OsHKT1;5
    + Thus, these results indicated that OsWRKY54 was a critical regulatory factor in salt tolerance in rice
