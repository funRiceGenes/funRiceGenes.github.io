    + WHITE STRIPE LEAF4 Encodes a Novel P-Type PPR Protein Required for Chloroplast Biogenesis during Early Leaf Development
    + Our findings identify WSL4 as a novel P-family PPR protein essential for chloroplast RNA group II intron splicing during early leaf development in rice.
    + The wsl4 mutant develops white-striped leaves during early leaf development, characterized by decreased chlorophyll content and malformed chloroplasts.
