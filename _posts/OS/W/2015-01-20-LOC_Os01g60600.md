* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter
    + OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions
    + Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
    + By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner
    + OsWRKY108 is an integrative regulator of phosphorus homeostasis and leaf inclination in rice.
    + Here, we report that OsWRKY108 acts as a positive regulator of leaf inclination
    + OsWRKY108 overexpressors showed increased leaf inclination and OsWRKY108-SRDX plants showed an erect-leaf phenotype, irrespective of the Pi regimes
    + Nevertheless, the response of leaf inclination to Pi starvation was largely impaired upon OsWRKY108 overexpression
    + Moreover, in both OsWRKY108-SRDX plants and OsWRKY108 overexpressors, the &#39;percentage of leaf angle alteration relative to wild-type&#39; under Pi-starvation condition was more significant than that under Pi-replete condition
    + These results suggest that the regulation of OsWRKY108 on leaf inclination is in part dependent on Pi availability
    + Altogether, our findings demonstrate that OsWRKY108 is an integrative regulator of P homeostasis and leaf inclination, serving as a link between plant nutrient signaling and developmental cues
    + Overexpression of either OsWRKY108 or OsWRKY21 led to up-regulation of Pi transporter genes and thus enhanced Pi accumulation
