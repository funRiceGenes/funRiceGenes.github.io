## Key message
1. __ ga __, [A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY24, which encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of both GA and ABA signaling
2. __ ga __, [A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D),  As to the GA signaling, OsWRKY24 differs from OsWRKY51 and -71, two negative regulators specifically function in the GA signaling pathway, in several ways
3. __ ga __, [A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D),  Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment
4. __ ga __, [A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these data demonstrate that OsWRKY24 is a novel type of transcriptional repressor that inhibits both GA and ABA signaling
