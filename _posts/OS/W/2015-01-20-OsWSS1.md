* **Key message**  
    + In addition, we found that the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) was significantly higher, while the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis was significantly downregulated in oswss1 as compared with the wild type
    + Map-based cloning revealed that OsWSS1 encodes transmembrane kinase TMK1
    + Mutation of OsWSS1 led to hyper-accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), more severe DNA fragmentation, and cell death than that of the wild-type control
    + OsWSS1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its encoded protein is localized to the plasma membrane
    + Moreover, oswss1 exhibits slightly rolled leaves with irregular epidermal cells, decreased chlorophyll contents, and defective stomata and chloroplasts as compared with the wild type
