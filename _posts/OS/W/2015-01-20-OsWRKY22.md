* **Key message**  
    + In contrast, inquiring a subset of biotic stress-related Affymetrix data, a large number of resistance and defence-related genes were found to be putatively co-expressed with OsWRKY22
    + oryzae strain, confirming that OsWRKY22 is involved in rice resistance to blast
    + OsWRKY22, a monocot WRKY gene, plays a role in the resistance response to blast
    + We conclude that OsWRKY22 promotes Al-induced increases in OsFRDL4 expression, thus enhancing Al-induced citrate secretion and Al tolerance in rice
    + We define the role of OsWRKY22 in response to Al stress in rice by using mutation and transgenic complementation assays, and characterize the regulation of OsFRDL4 by OsWRKY22 via yeas one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and ChIP-quantitative PCR
    + We next show that OsWRKY22 is localized in the nucleus, functions as a transcriptional activator and is able to bind to the promoter of OsFRDL4 via W-box elements
