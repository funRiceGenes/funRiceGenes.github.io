* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsWRI1a under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter severely retarded plant growth and development in rice
    + Thus, ectopic expression of OsWRI1a in rice enhances oil biosynthesis, but also leads to abnormal plant growth and development
    + Expressing the OsWRI1a gene under the control of the P1 promoter of Brittle2 (highly expressed in endosperm but low in leaves and roots) increased the oil content of both leaves and endosperms and upregulated the expression of several genes related to late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis
    + The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that OsWRI1a encoded a nuclear localized protein
