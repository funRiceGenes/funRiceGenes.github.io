* **Key message**  
    + The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76
    + Here, we report that XA21 binds to a WRKY transcription factor, called OsWRKY62
    + These results imply that OsWRKY62 functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity in rice, and serves as a critical mediator of both basal and race-specific defense responses
    + OsWRKY62 is a negative regulator of basal and Xa21-mediated defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice
    + Metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to dissect the enhanced disease resistance in the plants harbouring a RNA interfering construct of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 (dsOW62/76) genes
    + Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.
    + Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)/JA-Ile contents were increased in dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of individual OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 genes
    + These results indicate that OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 function as negative regulators of biosynthetic defense-related metabolites and provide evidence for an important role of phenylpropanoid pathway in SA production in rice
    + Background OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76, two close members of WRKY transcription factors, function together as transcriptional repressors
    + OsWRKY62 is predominantly localized in the cytosol
