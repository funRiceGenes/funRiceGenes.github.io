* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that wounding and BTH treatments induce OsWAK25 transcript expression in rice
    + We generated OsWAK25 overexpression lines and show that these lines exhibit a lesion mimic phenotype and enhanced expression of rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog 1), OsPAL2, PBZ1 and PR10
