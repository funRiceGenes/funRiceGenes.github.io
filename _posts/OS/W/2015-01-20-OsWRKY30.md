## Connection
1. __OsAOS2__, __OsWRKY30__, [Constitutive expression of rice WRKY30 gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid accumulation, PR gene expression and resistance to fungal pathogens in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutive expression of rice WRKY30 gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid accumulation, PR gene expression and resistance to fungal pathogens in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines overexpressing WRKY30 was associated with activated expression of JA synthesis-related genes LOX, AOS2 and pathogenesis-related (PR)3 and PR10, and increased endogenous JA accumulation under the challenge of fungal pathogens
2. __OsMPK7__, __OsWRKY30__, [OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
3. __OsMPK14__, __OsWRKY30__, [OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
4. __OsMPK6~OsMPK4__, __OsWRKY30__, [OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14
