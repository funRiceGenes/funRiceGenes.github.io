* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsWRKY21  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os01g60640](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g60640)

* **Publication**  
    + [OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions%5BTitle%5D), 2020, New Phytol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter
    + OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions
    + Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
    + By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner
