* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter
    + OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 function redundantly to promote phosphate accumulation through maintaining the constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1 under phosphate-replete conditions
    + Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1
    + By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner
    + The peak QTN (C/T) was located in the first coding region of a group III WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY21 (LOC_Os01g60640)
    + These data suggest the essential role of OsWRKY21 in regulation of internode elongation and plant height in rice
    + Most notably, overexpressing OsWRKY21 resulted in the semi-dwarf phenotype, early heading date and short internodes compared to the wild type, while the knockout mutant plants by CRISPR/Cas9 technology yielded the opposite
