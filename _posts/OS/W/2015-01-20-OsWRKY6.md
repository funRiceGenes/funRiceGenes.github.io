* **Key message**  
    + Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 enhanced disease resistance to pathogen
    + All together, OsWRKY6 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of the plant defense response
    + Defense-related genes were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY6
    + Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 gene in Arabidopsis activates the expression of defense related genes and enhances resistance to pathogens
    + OsWRKY6-ox lines displayed leaf lesions, and increased OsWRKY6 levels caused cell death
    + Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) OsWRKY6 exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens
    + By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses
    + Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization
    + This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations
    + OsWRKY transcription factors are involved in various biotic stress responses in rice, and OsWRKY6 specifically acts as an important defense regulator against Xoo
    + However, the relationship between OsWRKY6 and other OsWRKYs, as well as its role in resistance (R) gene-mediated defense, have yet to be studied in depth
    + The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + The rice protein OsWRKY6 directly activates OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47 expression, and also activates OsPR1a and OsPR1b through the two OsWRKYs, and this transcriptional module participates in Xa1-mediated defense against the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Here, we characterized a transcriptional cascade triggered by OsWRKY6 that regulated defense against Xoo infection mediated by the NBS-LRR protein Xa1
    + Two OsWRKY6 RNAi knockdown lines showed significantly reduced defense even against an incompatible Xoo infection, and the expression of OsWRKY6 was not regulated by OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY88
    + This study reveals that a novel downstream transcriptional pathway activated by OsWRKY6 is involved in Xa1-mediated defense against Xoo
