## Expression information
__Expression__: The salicylic acid SA-inducible Oryza sativa WRKY6 OsWRKY6 was identified as a positive regulator of Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related 10a OsPR10a by transient expression assays |  A physical interaction between OsWRKY6 and W-box-like element 1 WLE1), which positively regulates OsPR10a/probenazole induced protein 1 expression, was verified in vitro |  This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations |  OsWRKY6 autoregulates its own expression |  Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses
