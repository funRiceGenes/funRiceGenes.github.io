* **Key message**  
    + Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 enhanced disease resistance to pathogen
    + All together, OsWRKY6 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of the plant defense response
    + Defense-related genes were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY6
    + Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 gene in Arabidopsis activates the expression of defense related genes and enhances resistance to pathogens
    + OsWRKY6-ox lines displayed leaf lesions, and increased OsWRKY6 levels caused cell death
    + Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) OsWRKY6 exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens
    + By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses
    + Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization
    + This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations
