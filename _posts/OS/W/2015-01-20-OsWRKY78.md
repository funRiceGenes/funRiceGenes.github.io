* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsWRKY78 may acts as a stem elongation and seed development regulator in rice
    + The WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY78 regulates stem elongation and seed development in rice
    + Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that OsWRKY78 transcript was most abundant in elongating stems though its expression was detected in all the tested organs
    + Transgenic plants with OsWRKY78 overexpression exhibited a phenotype identical to the wild type, whereas inhibition of OsWRKY78 expression resulted in a semi-dwarf and small kernel phenotype due to reduced cell length in transgenic plants
