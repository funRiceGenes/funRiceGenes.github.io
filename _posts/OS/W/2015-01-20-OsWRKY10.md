* **Key message**  
    + Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance
    + Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of OsWRKY10 were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance
    + These OsWRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens
    + OsWRKY10 also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes
    + In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
