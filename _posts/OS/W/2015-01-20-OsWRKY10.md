* **Key message**  
    + Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance
    + Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of OsWRKY10 were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance
    + These OsWRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens
    + OsWRKY10 also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes
    + In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
    + The transcription factor OsWRKY10 inhibits phosphate uptake via suppressing OsPHT1;2 expression under phosphate-replete condition in rice.
    + Here, we functionally characterized a transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa), OsWRKY10
    + In accordance with this phenotype, OsWRKY10 was transcriptionally induced by Pi, and a subset of Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) genes were up-regulated upon its mutation, suggesting that OsWRKY10 is a transcriptional repressor in Pi uptake
    + Moreover, rice plants expressing the OsWRKY10-VP16 fusion protein (a dominant transcriptional activator) accumulated even more Pi than oswrky10
    + Knockout of OsWRKY10 led to increased Pi uptake and accumulation under Pi-replete condition
    + Genetic analysis showed that OsPHT1;2 was responsible for the increased Pi accumulation in oswrky10
    + Furthermore, during Pi starvation, OsWRKY10 protein was degraded through the 26S proteasome
