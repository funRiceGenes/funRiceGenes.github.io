## Expression information

## Key message
1. __disease resistance__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
2. __cold tolerance__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
3. __temperature__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid"
4. __transcription factor__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice
5. __blast__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid
