* **Key message**  
    + While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
    + Meanwhile, in vitro kinase assays and salt tolerance analyses showed that OsWAK112 possesses kinase activity and that it plays a negative role in the response of plants to salt stress
    + Overexpression of OsWAK112 in rice and heterologous expression of OsWAK112 in Arabidopsis significantly decreased plant survival under conditions of salt stress, while knocking down the OsWAK112 in rice increased plant survival under salt stress
    + In addition, OsWAK112 interacts with S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) 1/2/3, which catalyzes SAM synthesis from ATP and L-methionine, and promotes OsSAMS1 degradation under salt stress
    + These results indicate that OsWAK112 negatively regulates plant salt responses by inhibiting ethylene production, possibly via direct binding with OsSAMS1/2/3
    + OsWAK112 is universally expressed in plant and associated with cell wall
