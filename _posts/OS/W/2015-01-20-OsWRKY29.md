    + WRKY Transcription Factor OsWRKY29 Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.
    + OsWRKY29 is a member of WRKY transcription factor family which located in the nuclear
    + The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of OsWRKY29 had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy
    + In summary, we identified a new ABA signaling repressor OsWRKY29 that represses seed dormancy by directly downregulating the expression of OsABF1 and OsVP1
    + In addition, the expression levels of ABA positive response factors OsVP1 and OsABF1 were higher in the OsWRKY29 mutants but were lower in its overexpression lines
    + Here, we identified an  Oswrky29 mutant with enhanced dormancy in a screen of T-DNA insertion population

    + The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of OsWRKY29 had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy.
    + OsWRKY29 Functions as a Negative Regulator of Seed Dormancy
    + OsWRKY29 Acts as a Repressor of ABA-Inhibited Seed Germination
