* **Key message**  
    + OsWAK1 was also induced after treatment by mechanical wounding, SA and MeJA, but not by ABA
    + However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions
    + Northern blotting analysis showed that infection of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae significantly induced the OsWAK1 transcripts, and the accumulation of OsWAK1 mRNA occurred earlier and was more abundant in rice leaves infected with an incompatible race than with a compatible race of the blast fungus
    + This provides functional evidence that induction of OsWAK1 as a novel RLK plays important roles in plant disease resistance
    + A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance
    + OsWAK1 not only has the ability of autophosphorylation but also can phosphorylate OsRFP1, a putative transcription regulator recently identified in rice
    + Plasmolysis experiments further revealed OsWAK1 is associated with the cell wall
    + These results imply that OsWAK1 is a novel gene involved in plant defense
    + Furthermore, six transgenic rice lines with constitutive expression of OsWAK1 became resistant to the compatible race
