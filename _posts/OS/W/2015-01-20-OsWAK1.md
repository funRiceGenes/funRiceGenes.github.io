## Key message
1. __ sa __, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  OsWAK1 was also induced after treatment by mechanical wounding, SA and MeJA, but not by ABA
2. __growth__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions
3. __stem__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions
4. __magnaporthe oryzae__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Northern blotting analysis showed that infection of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae significantly induced the OsWAK1 transcripts, and the accumulation of OsWAK1 mRNA occurred earlier and was more abundant in rice leaves infected with an incompatible race than with a compatible race of the blast fungus
5. __disease__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  This provides functional evidence that induction of OsWAK1 as a novel RLK plays important roles in plant disease resistance
6. __disease__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D), A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance
7. __flower__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions
8. __transcription regulator__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  OsWAK1 not only has the ability of autophosphorylation but also can phosphorylate OsRFP1, a putative transcription regulator recently identified in rice
9. __root__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions
10. __blast__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Northern blotting analysis showed that infection of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae significantly induced the OsWAK1 transcripts, and the accumulation of OsWAK1 mRNA occurred earlier and was more abundant in rice leaves infected with an incompatible race than with a compatible race of the blast fungus

12. __cell wall__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Plasmolysis experiments further revealed OsWAK1 is associated with the cell wall
13. __defense__, ["A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance"%5BTitle%5D),  These results imply that OsWAK1 is a novel gene involved in plant defense
14. __disease resistance__, [A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance%5BTitle%5D),  This provides functional evidence that induction of OsWAK1 as a novel RLK plays important roles in plant disease resistance
