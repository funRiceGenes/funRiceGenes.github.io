* **Key message**  
    + Rice Transcription Factor OsWRKY55 Is Involved in the Drought Response and Regulation of Plant Growth
    + In this study, we found that transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsWRKY55 (OsWRKY55-OE) exhibited reduced drought resistance
    + OsWRKY55 was expressed in various tissues and was induced by drought and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments
    + These results suggest that OsWRKY55 plays a critical role in responses to drought stress and the regulation of plant height in rice, further providing valuable information for crop improvement
    + Furthermore, OsWRKY55 was able to reduce plant height under normal conditions by decreasing the cell size
    + Through yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that OsWRKY55 interacted with four mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that could be induced by drought, including OsMPK7, OsMPK9, OsMPK20-1, and OsMPK20-4
