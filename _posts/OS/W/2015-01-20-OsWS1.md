* **Key message**  
    + OsWS1 involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis is regulated by osa-miR1848.
    + Here, we show that rice OsWS1, a member of the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase gene family, involved in wax biosynthesis and was regulated by an osa-miR1848.
    + These results suggest that OsWS1 is regulated by osa-miR1848 and participates in cuticular wax formation.
