## Expression information

## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
2. __biotic stress__, [Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
3. __growth__, [Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of OsWRKY89 led to growth retardation at the early stage and reduction of internode length
4. __jasmonate__, [Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  RNA gel blot analysis indicated that OsWRKY89 was strongly induced by treatments of methyl jasmonate and UV-B radiation
5. __leaf__, [Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in wax deposition on leaf surfaces of the OsWRKY89 overexpression lines and a decrease in wax loading in the RNAi-mediated OsWRKY89 suppression lines
6. __blast__, [Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, overexpression of the OsWRKY89 gene enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus and white-backed planthopper as well as tolerance to UV-B irradiation
