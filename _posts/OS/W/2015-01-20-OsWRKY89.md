* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
    + Overexpression of OsWRKY89 led to growth retardation at the early stage and reduction of internode length
    + RNA gel blot analysis indicated that OsWRKY89 was strongly induced by treatments of methyl jasmonate and UV-B radiation
    + Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in wax deposition on leaf surfaces of the OsWRKY89 overexpression lines and a decrease in wax loading in the RNAi-mediated OsWRKY89 suppression lines
    + Interestingly, overexpression of the OsWRKY89 gene enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus and white-backed planthopper as well as tolerance to UV-B irradiation
