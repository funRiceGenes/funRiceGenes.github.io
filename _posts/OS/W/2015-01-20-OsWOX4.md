## Expression information

## Key message

## Connection
1. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __OsWOX4__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
2. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __OsWOX4__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice
3. __FCP2__, __OsWOX4__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
