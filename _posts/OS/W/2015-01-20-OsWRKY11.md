* **Key message**  
    + An OsWRKY11 gene, which encodes a transcription factor with the WRKY domain, was identified as one of the genes that was induced by both heat shock and drought stresses in seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa L
    + Enhanced heat and drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings overexpressing OsWRKY11 under the control of HSP101 promoter
    + To determine if overexpression of OsWRKY11 confers heat and drought tolerance, OsWRKY11 cDNA was fused to the promoter of HSP101 of rice and introduced into a rice cultivar Sasanishiki
    + Our results indicate that the OsWRKY11 gene plays a role in heat and drought stress response and tolerance, and might be useful for improvement of stress tolerance
    + Ectopic expression of OsWRKY11 resulted in enhanced resistance to a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + oryzae; resistance was compromised in transgenic lines under-expressing OsWRKY11
    + Ectopic expression of OsWRKY11 resulted in constitutive expression of defense-associated genes, whereas knock-down (kd) of OsWRKY11 reduced expression of defense-associated genes during pathogen attack, suggesting that OsWRKY11 activates defense responses
    + In addition, ectopic expression of OsWRKY11 enhanced tolerance to drought stress and induced constitutive expression of drought-responsive genes
    + OsWRKY11 is induced by pathogens, drought, and heat, suggesting a function in biotic and abiotic stress responses
    + OsWRKY11 integrates plant responses to pathogens and abiotic stresses by positively modulating the expression of biotic and abiotic stress-related genes
