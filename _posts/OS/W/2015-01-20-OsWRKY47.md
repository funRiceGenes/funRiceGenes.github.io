## Key message
1. __blast__, [Transcriptional Profiling of Rice Early Response to Magnaporthe oryzae Identified OsWRKYs as Important Regulators in Rice Blast Resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcriptional Profiling of Rice Early Response to Magnaporthe oryzae Identified OsWRKYs as Important Regulators in Rice Blast Resistance%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpressing one of these WRKY genes, OsWRKY47, in transgenic rice plants conferred enhanced resistance against rice blast fungus
2. __transcription factor__, [The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.%5BTitle%5D), The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.
3. __transcription factor__, [The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.%5BTitle%5D), OsWRKY47 is a divergent rice transcription factor belonging to the group II of the WRKY family
4. __drought__, [The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.%5BTitle%5D),  A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
5. __drought__, [The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analysis carried out with transgenic rice plants showed that Oswrky47 mutants displayed higher sensitivity to drought and reduced yield, while plants overexpressing OsWRKY47 were more tolerant
6. __stress__, [The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.%5BTitle%5D),  A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
7. __drought stress__, [The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.%5BTitle%5D),  A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
