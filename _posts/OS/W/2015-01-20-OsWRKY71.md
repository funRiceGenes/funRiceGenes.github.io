* **Key message**  
    + To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
    + However, two of these non-DNA-binding mutants are still able to repress GA induction by enhancing the binding affinity of the wild-type DNA-binding OsWRKY71 repressors
    + In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
    + The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76
    + OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response
    + One of them, OsWRKY71, was up-regulated by several defense signaling molecules, such as SA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), as well as wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting that OsWRKY71 might function in rice biotic stress response
    + Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants
    + These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways
    + Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB
    + Exogenous GA treatment decreases the steady-state mRNA level of OsWRKY71 and destabilizes the GFP:OsWRKY71 fusion protein
    + These findings suggest that OsWRKY71 encodes a transcriptional repressor of GA signaling in aleurone cells
    + Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment
    + Microarray analysis revealed that several elicitor-induced defense-related genes were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY71
    + These results indicate that the activation of defense-related genes by OsWRKY71 was probably indirect
