* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.
    + Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice
    + OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice
    + oryzae by suppressing JA signaling-related genes, and WRKY45-2 transcriptionally activates WRKY13, whose encoding protein in turn transcriptionally suppresses WRKY42 to regulate rice resistance to M
    + Expression of the rice transcription factor OsWRKY42 is induced upon treatment of rice leaves with CWDEs, wounding and salt
    + OsWRKY42 expressing Arabidopsis lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to methyl jasmonate mediated growth inhibition
    + The results presented here suggest that OsWRKY42 regulates plant responses to either cell wall damage or salinity stress by acting as a negative regulator of jasmonic acid mediated responses
    + Upon treatment with NaCl, Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing OsWRKY42 exhibited high levels of anthocyanin and displayed enhanced tolerance to salt stress
    + Ectopic expression of OsWRKY42 results in reduced expression of cell wall damage and salt stress induced jasmonic acid biosynthesis and response genes
    + Overexpression of OsWRKY42 leads to enhanced callose deposition in rice and Arabidopsis but this does not enhance tolerance to bacterial infection
    + Treatment with either one of the two different cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs), LipaseA and CellulaseA, induces immune responses and enhances the expression of OsWRKY42 in rice
    + However, the role of OsWRKY42 in CWDE induced immune responses is not known
