* **Key message**  
    + OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.
    + Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice
    + OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice
    + oryzae by suppressing JA signaling-related genes, and WRKY45-2 transcriptionally activates WRKY13, whose encoding protein in turn transcriptionally suppresses WRKY42 to regulate rice resistance to M
