* **Key message**  
    + Here we report a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY24, which encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of both GA and ABA signaling
    + As to the GA signaling, OsWRKY24 differs from OsWRKY51 and -71, two negative regulators specifically function in the GA signaling pathway, in several ways
    + Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment
    + Together, these data demonstrate that OsWRKY24 is a novel type of transcriptional repressor that inhibits both GA and ABA signaling
    + Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct
    + Recently, two rice genes, OsAPETALA2 (OsAP2) and OsWRKY24 have been reported to be positive regulators involved in increased lamina inclination and grain size through cell elongation
    + OsWRKY24 functions redundantly with OsWRKY53, while OsWRKY70 functions differently from OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size
    + However, whether the OsWRKY53 homologs OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 also contribute to grain size which remains unknown
    + Here, we report that grain size in OsWRKY24 overexpression lines and oswrky24 mutants is similar to that of the wild type
    + Importantly, a systematic characterization of seed length in the oswrky70 single, the oswrky53 oswrky70 double and the oswrky24 oswrky53 oswrky70 triple mutant indicated that loss of OsWRKY70 also leads to increased seed length, suggesting that OsWRKY70 might play a role distinct from that of OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size
    + Taken together, these findings suggest that OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 regulate rice grain size redundantly and independently from OsWRKY53
