* **Key message**  
    + When OsWRKY114 is overexpressed in transgenic plants they show enhanced disease resistance against Xoo compared with wild types
    + These results suggest that OsWRKY114 enhances the innate immunity of Asian rice against Xoo through direct activation of defense genes that include OsPR1a and chtinase
    + OsWRKY114 has transcriptional activity in yeast and localizes in the nucleus
    + This is the first report to functionally characterize OsWRKY114 in Xoo infection
    + When OsWRKY114 is overexpressed in transgenic plants they show enhanced disease and cell-based functional analyses, we showed OsWRKY114 directly associates with the promoters of OsPR1a and Chitinase and increases the promoter activities
