* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsWRKY114  
    + MSU: None

* **Publication**  
    + [Rice transcription factor WRKY114 directly regulates the expression of OsPR1a and Chitinase to enhance resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice transcription factor WRKY114 directly regulates the expression of OsPR1a and Chitinase to enhance resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

* **Key message**  
    + When OsWRKY114 is overexpressed in transgenic plants they show enhanced disease resistance against Xoo compared with wild types
    + These results suggest that OsWRKY114 enhances the innate immunity of Asian rice against Xoo through direct activation of defense genes that include OsPR1a and chtinase
    + OsWRKY114 has transcriptional activity in yeast and localizes in the nucleus
    + This is the first report to functionally characterize OsWRKY114 in Xoo infection
