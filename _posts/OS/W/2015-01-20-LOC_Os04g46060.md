    + Double knockout of OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 boosts lignification with altering culm morphology of rice
    + To collect information on enhancing lignin deposition in grass species, important lignocellulose feedstocks, we generated rice (Oryza sativa) transgenic lines deficient in OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102, which encode putative transcriptional repressors for secondary cell wall formation
    + Both OsWRKY36 and OsWRKY102 mutations significantly increased lignin content by up to 28 % and 32 %, respectively
    + This was confirmed by the finding that overexpression of OsWRKY36 caused a similar small grain and semi-dwarf phenotype to the sgsd3 mutant whereas knock down and knock out caused larger grain phenotypes
    + The sgsd3 mutant was also hyposensitive to GA and accumulated higher mRNA and protein levels of SLR1 (a GA signaling DELLA-like inhibitor) compared with the WT
