* **Key message**  
    + We herein reported OsZHD1 with key roles in rice morphogenesis, especially in the modulating of leaf rolling, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of leaf development in rice
    + The abaxially curled leaf phenotypes, co-segregating with the inserted transferred DNA, were caused by overexpression of a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor (OsZHD1)
    + Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice
    + Artificial overexpression of OsZHD1 or its closest homolog OsZHD2 induced the abaxial leaf curling
    + OsZHD1 exhibited a constitutive expression pattern in wild-type plants and accumulated in the developing leaves and panicles
    + Homeobox transcription factors OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induce inflorescence meristem activity at floral transition in rice.
    + Among several regulatory genes that are preferentially expressed in the inflorescence meristem during the floral transition, this study examines the homeobox genes OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 for their roles in regulating this transition
