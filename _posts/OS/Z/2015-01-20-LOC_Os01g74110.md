* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsZIP1 grew better under excess metal stress but accumulated less of the metals in plants
    + We further identified the DNA methylation of histone H3K9me2 of OsZIP1 and found that OsZIP1 locus, whose transcribed regions imbed a 242â€‰bp sequence, is demethylated, suggesting that epigenetic modification is likely associated with OsZIP1 function under Cd stress
    + OsZIP1 functions as a metal efflux transporter limiting excess zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation in rice.
    + In this report, we provided evidence that OsZIP1 is a metal-detoxified transporter through preventing excess Zn, Cu and Cd accumulation in rice
    + OsZIP1 is a transporter that is required for detoxification of excess Zn, Cu and Cd in rice
    + Expression of OsZIP-GFP fusion in rice protoplasts and tobacco leaves shows that OsZIP1 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM)
