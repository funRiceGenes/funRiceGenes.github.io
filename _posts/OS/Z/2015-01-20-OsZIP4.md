    + Furthermore, OsZIP4 transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsZIP4 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were produced
    + The Zn concentration in seeds of 35S-OsZIP4 plants was four times lower compared with vector controls
    + The Zn concentration in roots of 35S-OsZIP4 transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots
    + Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts of OsZIP4 expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants, but levels of endogenous OsZIP4 transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls
    + Microarray analysis revealed that the genes expressed in shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants coincided with those induced in shoots of Zn-deficient plants
    + Microarray and northern blot analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was highly expressed under conditions of Zn deficiency in roots and shoots
    + Real-time-PCR revealed that the OsZIP4 transcripts were more abundant than those of OsZIP1 or OsZIP3 in Zn-deficient roots and shoots
    + In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsZIP4 in Zn-deficient rice was expressed in shoots and roots, especially in phloem cells
    + Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants
    + OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that localizes to apical cells
    + These results indicate that constitutive expression of OsZIP4 changes the Zn distribution within rice plants, and that OsZIP4 is a critical Zn transporter that must be strictly regulated
    + Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated
    + OsZIP4 complemented a Zn-uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant, Deltazrt1,Deltazrt2, indicating that OsZIP4 is a functional transporter of Zn
    + These results suggested that OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that may be responsible for the translocation of Zn within rice plants
    + OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice
    + Immunostaining analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was mainly expressed in phloem of diffuse vascular bundles (DVBs) in the nodes and the axillary meristem
    + Mutation of OsZIP4 did not affect the total Zn uptake, but altered Zn distribution; less Zn was delivered to TB and new leaf, but more Zn was retained in the basal stems at the vegetative growth stage
    + At the reproductive stage, mutation of OsZIP4 resulted in delayed panicles development, which is associated with decreased Zn distribution to the panicles
    + Collectively, OsZIP4 is involved in transporting Zn to the phloem of DVBs in the nodes for subsequent distribution to TBs and other developing tissues
