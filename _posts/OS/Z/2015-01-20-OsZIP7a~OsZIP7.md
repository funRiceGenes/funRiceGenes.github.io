* **Key message**  
    + It suggested that the OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 might encode an iron and a zinc transporter protein in rice respectively
    + By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach, it was found that the expression of OsZIP7a was significantly induced in rice roots by iron-deficiency, while that of OsZIP8 induced in both rice roots and shoots by zinc-deficiency
    + When expressed in yeast cells, OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 could complement an iron-uptake-deficient yeast mutant and a zinc-uptake-deficient yeast mutant respectively
    + OsZIP7 expression in Arabidopsis resulted in a 25% increase in shoot Zn concentrations compared to non-transformed plants
    + Among the most promising candidates, we identified two lines ovexpressing the metal cation transporter OsZIP7
    + We further characterized OsZIP7 and showed that it is localized to the plasma membrane and is able to complement Zn transport defective (but not Fe defective) yeast mutants
    + OsZIP7 functions in xylem loading in roots and inter-vascular transfer in nodes to deliver Zn/Cd to grain in rice.
    + Thus, OsZIP7 plays an integral role in xylem loading in roots and inter-vascular transfer in nodes to preferentially deliver Zn and Cd to developing tissues and rice grains
    + OsZIP7 was expressed in parenchyma cells of vascular bundles in roots and nodes
    + Our data suggest that OsZIP7 is important for Zn homeostasis under physiological Zn concentrations, and that Fe homeostasis might be affected due to loss of function of OsZIP7
    + Here we describe a Tos17 loss-of-function line for the Zn plasma membrane transporter OsZIP7 (oszip7)
    + On the other hand, we found that Zn excess is more deleterious to oszip7 plants compared to wild type, which may be linked to secondary effects in concentrations of other elements such as Fe
    + OsNAC15 Regulates Tolerance to Zinc Deficiency and Cadmium by Binding to OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 in Rice.
    + The yeast one-hybrid assay, transient transcriptional activity assay using the dual-luciferase reporter system and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that OsNAC15 directly binds to the zinc deficiency-responsive element motifs in the promoters of OsZIP7 and OsZIP10 to repress their transcriptions
