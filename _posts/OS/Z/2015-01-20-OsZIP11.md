* **Key message**  
    + Knocking out OsZIP11 by CRISPR-Cas9 approach led to the attenuated rice growth and physiological phenotypes, depicting shorter plant height, reduced biomass, chlorosis (a symptom of lower chlorophyll concentration), and over-accumulation of malondialdehyde (complex representing the peroxidation of membrane lipids) in rice plantlets
    + Our work pointed out that OsZIP11 is required for iron acquisition for rice growth and development
    + OsZIP11 was preferentially expressed in the rice tissues (or organs) at later flowering and seed development stages
    + The field trials demonstrated that OsZIP11 mutation impaired the capacity of seed development, with shortened panicle and seed length, compromised spikelet fertility, and reduced grain per plant or 1000-grain weight
    + OsZIP11 is a trans-Golgi-residing transporter required for rice iron accumulation and development.
    + Whether the rice ZRT/IRT-like protein family metal transporter OsZIP11 is involved in Fe transport has not been functionally defined
    + Transcripts of OsZIP11 were significantly induced under Fe but not under zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) or manganese (Mn) deficiency
    + The objective of the study is to figure out the essential role of the uncharacterized OsZIP11 played in rice growth, development, and iron accumulation, particularly in seeds
    + Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) transformed with OsZIP11 sequences displayed an active iron input which turned out that excessive iron accumulated in the cells
    + Knocking out OsZIP11 also lowered the accumulation of iron in the brown rice by 48-51% compared to the wild-type
