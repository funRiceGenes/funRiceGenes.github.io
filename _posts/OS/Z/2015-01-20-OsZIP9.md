* **Key message**  
    + The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and OsZIP9 overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root
    + The decreased Zn/Cd levels and growth retardation in the oszip5 mutant are less severe than in the oszip9 mutant
    + However, OsZIP9 is also regulated by systemic signals of Zn status from the shoot
    + The ZIP transporter family member OsZIP9 contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.
    + Furthermore, OsZIP9 was expressed in the exodermis and endodermis of root mature regions
    + For plants grown in a hydroponic solution with low Zn concentration, knockout of OsZIP9 significantly reduced plant growth, which was accompanied by decreased Zn concentrations in both the root and shoot
    + Combined, these results indicate that OsZIP9 localized at the root exodermis and endodermis functions as an influx transporter of Zn and contributes to Zn uptake under Zn-limited conditions in rice
    + Expression pattern analysis showed that OsZIP9 was mainly expressed in the roots throughout all growth stages and its expression was up-regulated by Zn-deficiency
    + OsZIP9 was mainly localized to the plasma membrane and showed transport activity for Zn in yeast
    + Taken together, these results show that OsZIP9 is an important influx transporter responsible for uptake of Zn and Co from external media into root cells
    + OsZIP9 knockout rice plants showed a significant reduction in growth at low Zn concentration, but could be rescued by high Zn supply
    + Natural variation of OsZIP9 expression level is highly associated with Zn content in milled grain among rice varieties in the germplasm collection
    + A high activity zinc transporter OsZIP9 mediates zinc uptake in rice.
