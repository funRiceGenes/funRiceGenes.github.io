## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  It suggested that the OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 might encode an iron and a zinc transporter protein in rice respectively
2. __root__, [Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach, it was found that the expression of OsZIP7a was significantly induced in rice roots by iron-deficiency, while that of OsZIP8 induced in both rice roots and shoots by zinc-deficiency
3. __zinc__, [Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach, it was found that the expression of OsZIP7a was significantly induced in rice roots by iron-deficiency, while that of OsZIP8 induced in both rice roots and shoots by zinc-deficiency
4. __zinc__, [Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP Zrt, Irt-like protein gene family in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  When expressed in yeast cells, OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 could complement an iron-uptake-deficient yeast mutant and a zinc-uptake-deficient yeast mutant respectively
