* **Key message**  
    + The Oryza sativa (rice) carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase OsZAS was described to produce zaxinone, a plant growth-promoting apocarotenoid
    + Overall, our results show that the genetic manipulation of OsZAS activity inâ€‰planta leads to a different effect on AM symbiosis from that of exogenous zaxinone treatment, and demonstrate that OsZAS influences the extent of AM colonization, acting as a component of a regulatory network that involves SLs
    + Moreover, exogenous treatment with the synthetic SL analog GR24 rescued the zas mutant mycorrhizal phenotype, indicating that the lower AM colonization rate of zas is caused by a deficiency in SLs at the early stages of the interaction, and indicating that during this phase OsZAS activity is required to induce SL production, possibly mediated by the Dwarf14-Like (D14L) signaling pathway
