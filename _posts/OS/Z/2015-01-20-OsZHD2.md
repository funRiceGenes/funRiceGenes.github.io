* **Key message**  
    + Homeobox transcription factor OsZHD2 promotes root meristem activity in rice by inducing ethylene biosynthesis.
    + OsZHD2 was preferentially expressed in shoot apical meristem and root tips
    + Treatment with ACC, an ethylene precursor, induced the expression of DR5 reporter at the root tip and stele, whereas an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor, AVG, treatment decreased that expression in both WT and OsZHD2 overexpression line
    + These observations suggest that OsZHD2 enhances root meristem activity by influencing ethylene biosynthesis and, in turn, auxin
    + ChIP assay results suggested that OsZHD2 induces ethylene biosynthesis by controlling ACS5 directly
