* **Key message**  
    + We further discovered that a C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, is an OsMYB60 binding partner and involved in leaf development.
    + A C2H2 transcription factor, OsZFP7, also is involved in the TL/OsMYB60‚Äêregulated pathway to maintain leaf flattening
    + Taken together, ZFP207 acts as a transcriptional repressor of SD1/OsGA20ox2 and it may play a critical role in plant growth and development through fine-tuning GA biosynthesis in rice
    + RNA interference of ZFP207 caused increased plant height and grain length
    + Here we report a Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein ZFP207 acting as a transcriptional repressor of OsGA20ox2
    + ZFP207 was mainly accumulated in young tissues and more specifically in culm nodes
