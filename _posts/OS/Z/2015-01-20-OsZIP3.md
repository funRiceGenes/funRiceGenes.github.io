## Expression information
__Expression__: We found that a member of ZIP ZRT, IRT-like Protein), OsZIP3, showed a high expression in the nodes of rice Oryza sativa |  Neither OsZIP3 gene expression nor protein encoded was affected by either deficiency or toxic level of Zn  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __xylem__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Immunostaining revealed that OsZIP3 was localized at the xylem intervening parenchyma cells and xylem transfer cell of the enlarged vascular bundle in both basal and upper nodes
2. __xylem__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, OsZIP3 located in the node is responsible for unloading Zn from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, which is the first step for preferential distribution of Zn to the developing tissues in rice
3. __vascular bundle__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Immunostaining revealed that OsZIP3 was localized at the xylem intervening parenchyma cells and xylem transfer cell of the enlarged vascular bundle in both basal and upper nodes

5. __shoot__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Knockdown of OsZIP3 resulted in significantly reduced Zn in the shoot basal region containing shoot meristem and elongating zone, but increased Zn in the transpiration flow
6. __meristem__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Knockdown of OsZIP3 resulted in significantly reduced Zn in the shoot basal region containing shoot meristem and elongating zone, but increased Zn in the transpiration flow
7. __transporter__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D), A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.
8. __R protein__, [A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Neither OsZIP3 gene expression nor protein encoded was affected by either deficiency or toxic level of Zn
