* **Key message**  
    + We found that loss of OsHYPK function leads to developmental defects in rice plant architecture but increased resistance to abiotic stresses, attributable to perturbation of the N-terminal acetylomeÂ and accelerated global protein turnover
    + Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsHYPK is also a substrate of NatA and that N-terminal acetylation of OsHYPK promotes its own degradation, probably through the Ac/N-degron pathway, which could be induced by abiotic stresses
