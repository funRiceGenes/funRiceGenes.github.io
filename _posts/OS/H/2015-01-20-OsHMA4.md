* **Key message**  
    + We provide evidence that OsHMA4 functions to sequester Cu into root vacuoles, limiting Cu accumulation in the grain
    + Here we identify OsHMA4 as the likely causal gene of a quantitative trait locus controlling Cu accumulation in rice grain
    + The difference in grain Cu accumulation is most likely attributed to a single amino acid substitution that leads to different OsHMA4 transport activity
    + Identification of natural allelic variation in OsHMA4 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with grain Cu concentrations tuned to both the concentration of Cu in the soil and dietary needs
    + A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.

    + __OsHMA4__, __OsNRAMP5__, [Univariate and Multivariate QTL Analyses Reveal Covariance Among Mineral Elements in the Rice Ionome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Univariate and Multivariate QTL Analyses Reveal Covariance Among Mineral Elements in the Rice Ionome%5BTitle%5D),  The candidate genes underlying the QTL clusters with elemental QTLs, PC-QTLs and aPC-QTLs co-localized were identified, including OsHMA4 and OsNRAMP5
