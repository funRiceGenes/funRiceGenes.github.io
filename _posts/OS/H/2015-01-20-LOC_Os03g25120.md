* **Key message**  
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsHsfB4d exhibited enhanced resistance to RS105 and PXO99a as well as increased expression of OsHsp18
    + OsHsfB4d is upregulated post inoculation by either the Xoc strain RS105 or Xoo strain PXO99a in Zhonghua 11 (wild type, ZH11) as well as in OsHsp18
    + OsHsfB4d Binds the Promoter and Regulates the Expression of OsHsp18.0-CI to Resistant Against Xanthomonas Oryzae.
    + Both OsHsfB4b and OsHsfB4d showed strong responses to the stress treatment
    + This study provides a basis for understanding the function and evolutionary history of the OsHsf gene family, enriching our knowledge of understanding the biological functions of OsHsfB4b and OsHsfB4d genes involved in the stress response in rice, and also reveals the potential value of OsHsfB4b in rice environmental adaptation improvement
    + The results of subcellular localization showed that the OsHsfB4b protein was in the nucleus whereas the OsHsfB4d protein was located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
