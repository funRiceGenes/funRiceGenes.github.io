* **Key message**  
    + Transcription of the OsHIRP1 was upregulated in response to heat and drought treatment
    + OsHIRP1 is an E3 ligase that acts as a positive regulator in the plant response to heat stress, thus providing important information relating to adaptation and regulation under heat stress in plant
    + Two interacting partners, OsARK4 and OsHRK1, were identified via yeast-two-hybrid screening, which were mainly targeted to the nucleus (OsARK4) and cytosol (OsHRK1), and their interactions with OsHIRP1 were confirmed by biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)
