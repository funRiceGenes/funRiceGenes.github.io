* **Key message**  
    + Knocking down expression of OsHMA7 by RNAi silencing of endogenous gene resulted in plants with altered domestication traits such as plant height, tiller number, panicle size and architecture, grain color, shape, size, grain shattering, heading date and increased sensitivity to Fe and Zn deficiency
    + We identified two alleles 261 and 284 of a Gramineae-specific heavy metal transporter gene OsHMA7 by analyzing expression patterns and sequences of genes within QTLs for high Fe &amp; Zn, in Madhukar x Swarna recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with high (HL) or low (LL) grain Fe &amp; Zn
    + Altered expression of OsHMA7 influenced transcript levels of iron-responsive genes indicating cellular Fe-Zn homeostasis and also several domestication-related genes in rice
