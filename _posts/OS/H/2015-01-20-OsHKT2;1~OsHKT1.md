* **Key message**  
    + No-OsHKT2;2/1 is essentially expressed in roots and displays a significant level of expression at high Na(+) concentrations, in contrast to OsHKT2;1
    + The OsHKT2;1 (previously named OsHKT1) transporter from rice functions as a relatively Na+-selective transporter in heterologous expression systems, but the in vivo function of OsHKT2;1 remains unknown
    + These analyses demonstrate that Na+ can enhance growth of rice under K+ starvation conditions, and that OsHKT2;1 is the central transporter for nutritional Na+ uptake into K+-starved rice roots
    + Rice OsHKT2;1 transporter mediates large Na+ influx component into K+ -starved roots for growth
    + In addition, the presence of external K(+) and Ca(2+) down-regulated OsHKT2;1-mediated Na(+) influx in two plant systems, Bright-Yellow 2 cells and intact rice roots, and also in Xenopus oocytes
    + In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
    + We propose that OsHKT transporters are involved in Na+ movements in rice, and that OsHKT1 specifically mediates Na+ uptake in rice roots when the plants are K+ deficient
    + Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+
    + Parallel experiments of K+ and Na+ uptake in yeast expressing the wheat or rice HKT1 transporters proved that they were very different; TaHKT1 transported K+ and Na+, and OsHKT1 only Na+
    + Upon NaCl stress, the OsHKT1 transcript was significantly down-regulated in salt-tolerant cv
    + Pokkali regulates the expression of OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA differently from how the salt-sensitive cv
    + Expressions of OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA are differentially regulated under NaCl stress in salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars
    + OsHKT2;1 was mainly expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots
    + (22)Na+ tracer influx experiments revealed that Na+ influx into oshkt2;1-null roots was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type plants
    + Therefore, here we analyze two highly homologous rice (Oryza sativa) HKT transporters in plant cells, OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2, that show differential K(+) permeabilities in heterologous systems
    + Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells
    + We have investigated OsHKT2;1 natural variation in a collection of 49 cultivars with different levels of salt tolerance and geographical origins
    + The OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA transporter genes might play important roles in maintaining cytosolic Na(+) homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + Interestingly, three independent oshkt2;1-null alleles exhibited significantly reduced growth compared with wild-type plants under low Na+ and K+ starvation conditions
    + Of these, the sodium transporter gene OsHKT2;1 emerged as a key factor that impacts on KUE based on (i) the correlation between shoot Na+ and KUE, and (ii) higher levels of HKT2;1 expression in high KUE lines
    + Expression levels of the Na+/K+ transporter OsHKT2;1 and vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger OsNHX1, Na enrichment, maintaining the photosynthetic abilities and growth performances of indica rice seedlings under salt stress.
    + The aim of this investigation was to determine the OsNHX1 (a vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger) and OsHKT2;1 (Na+/K+ transporter) regulation by salt stress (200<U+00A0>mM NaCl) in two rice cultivars, i
    + Pokkali (15<U+00A0>min after salt stress) due to the higher expression of OsHKT2;1 gene (by 2
    + Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress
    + Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in oswrky28 mutants than those in wide type plants
