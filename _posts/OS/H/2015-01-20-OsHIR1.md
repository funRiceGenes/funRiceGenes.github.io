## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cell death__, [Rice hypersensitive induced reaction protein 1 OsHIR1 associates with plasma membrane and triggers hypersensitive cell death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice hypersensitive induced reaction protein 1 OsHIR1 associates with plasma membrane and triggers hypersensitive cell death%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that OsHIR1 triggers hypersensitive cell death and its localization to the plasma membrane is enhanced by OsLRR1
