* **Key message**  
    + CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of the susceptibility gene OsHPP04 in rice confers enhanced resistance to rice root-knot nematode.
    + These findings suggest that OsHPP04 may be an S gene as a negative regulator of host immunity and genetic modification of S genes through the CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used as a powerful tool to generate PPN resistant plant varieties
