* **Key message**  
    + Further dynamic expression analysis demonstrated that OsHTAS ( a ) was actively responsive to 45 degrees C high temperature stress compared with the OsHTAS ( b ) allele
    + The genetic analysis of F(1) and F(2) offspring derived from the cross between HT54 and HT13, a heat-sensitive breeding line, reveals that the heat tolerance of HT54 was controlled by a dominant major locus, which has been designated as OsHTAS (Oryza sativa heat tolerance at seedling stage)
    + The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice
    + OsHTAS was responsive to multiple stresses and strongly induced by exogenous ABA
    + OsHTAS modulated H2O2 accumulation of shoots thus altered the stomatal aperture status of rice leaves, and promoted ABA biosynthesis
