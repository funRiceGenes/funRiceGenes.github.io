    + __OsHAP3B__, __OsHAP3C__, [OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice%5BTitle%5D), We have isolated three genes that potentially encode a HAP3/nuclear factor-YB (NF-YB)/CCAAT binding factor-A (CBF-A) subunit of a CCAAT-box binding complex in rice (Oryza sativa), and named them OsHAP3A, OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C
    + __OsHAP3B__, __OsHAP3C__, [OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In the transgenic rice plants with antisense or RNAi construct of OsHAP3A, reduced expression of not only OsHAP3A but also OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C was observed
