    + Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.
    + This result provides compelling evidence that OsHXK7 functions in sugar signaling via a glycolysis-dependent manner under normal conditions, but its signaling role is suppressed when O2 is deficient
    + This result suggests the distinct role that OsHXK7 plays in sugar metabolism and efficient germination by enforcing glycolysis-mediated fermentation in O2 -deficient rice
    + These results suggest that OsHXK7 binding to Glc leads to a conformational change, that is likely essential for the function of OsHXK7 in Glc signalling and metabolism during plant growth and development
