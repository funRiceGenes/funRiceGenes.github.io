## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: According to transient expression assays that used the promoter:luciferase fusion construct, OsHXK7 enhanced the glucose Glc-dependent repression of a rice α-amylase gene RAmy3D in the mesophyll protoplasts of maize, but its catalytically inactive mutant alleles did not |  Consistently, the expression of OsHXK7, but not its catalytically inactive alleles, complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 gin2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in the wild type characteristics of Glc-dependent repression, seedling development, and plant growth |  The germination of two null OsHXK7 mutants, oshxk7-1 and oshxk7-2, was affected by O2 deficiency, but overexpression enhanced germination in rice  
__OverExpression__: The germination of two null OsHXK7 mutants, oshxk7-1 and oshxk7-2, was affected by O2 deficiency, but overexpression enhanced germination in rice
