* **Key message**  
    + Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles
    + Ectopic expression of both LF1 and the meristem maintenance gene OSH1 was detected in the axil of the sterile lemma primordia of the lf1 spikelet
    + In the lf1 spikelet, lateral floral meristems were promoted unexpectedly and could generally blossom into relatively normal florets
    + Collectively, these results indicate that the mutation of LF1 induces ectopic expression of OSH1, which results in the initiation of lateral meristems to generate lateral florets in the axil of the sterile lemma
