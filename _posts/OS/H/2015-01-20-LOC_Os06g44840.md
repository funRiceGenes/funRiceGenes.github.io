* **Key message**  
    + cDNAs encoding homogentisic acid geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT), which catalyzes the committed step of tocotrienol biosynthesis, were isolated from barley, wheat and rice seeds
    + Overexpression of the barley HGGT in corn seeds resulted in an increase in tocotrienol and tocopherol content of as much as six-fold
    + Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice
    + A map-based cloning strategy and subsequent complementation test showed that SGD1 encodes homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis
    + The rtd1 mutant showed overall growth retardation throughout the growth period
    + The cold-related C-repeat-binding factor (CBF)/dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1 (DREB1) genes were significantly upregulated in rtd1 under natural growth conditions
    + RTD1 encodes a homogentisate phytyltransferase catalyzing a key step in rice tocopherol biosynthesis, confers cold tolerance and regulates rice development by affecting the accumulation of DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1
    + Map-based cloning revealed that the RTD1 gene encoded a homogentisate phytyltransferase, a key enzyme catalyzing the committed step in tocopherol biosynthesis
    + Cold tolerance was found to be reduced in rtd1
    + Moreover, rtd1 exhibited a reduced response to gibberellin (GA)
    + Therefore, it appears that the antioxidant potential of transgenic oil-producing plants such as soybean, sunflower, and corn may be enhanced by overexpressing OsHGGT during seed germination
