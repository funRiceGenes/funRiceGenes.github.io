* **Key message**  
    + Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis
    + METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment
    + CONCLUSIONS: OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice
    + Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice
    + Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor
    + Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica
    + For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment
    + Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions
    + PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Expression of OsHsfC1b was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H(2)O(2)
