* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we revealed that the histone deacetylase OsHDA706 epigenetically regulates the expression of salt stress response genes in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + OsHDA706 localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm and OsHDA706 expression is significantly induced under salt stress
    + Moreover, oshda706 mutants showed a higher sensitivity to salt stress than the wild-type
    + We found that the expression of OsPP2C49 is induced in the oshda706 mutant under salt stress
    + Histone deacetylase OsHDA706 increases salt tolerance via H4K5/K8 deacetylation of OsPP2C49 in rice.
