* **Key message**  
    + OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor
    + The OsHSF7 gene was found to be rapidly expressed in high levels in response to temperature, which indicates that it may be involved in heat stress reception and response
    + Collectively, the results of this study indicate that OsHSF7 might play an important role in the response to high temperature
    + Specifically, these findings indicate that OsHSF7 may be useful in the production of transgenic monocots that can over-express protective genes such as HSPs in response to heat stress, which will enable such plants to tolerate high temperatures
    + However, when the plant suffers heat stress, OsHSFA2d is alternatively spliced into a transcriptionally active form, OsHSFA2dI, which participates in the heat stress response (HSR)
    + A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in the promoter of a candidate gene, HTG3 (heat-tolerance gene on chromosome 3), was found to be significantly associated with heat-induced expression of HTG3 and heat tolerance (HT)
