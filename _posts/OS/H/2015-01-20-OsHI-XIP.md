* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsHI-XIP decreased the feeding and oviposion preferences of the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, but did not influence the growth and development of rice plants
    + The results suggest that the rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor OsHI-XIP is involved in the resistance in rice to herbivores
