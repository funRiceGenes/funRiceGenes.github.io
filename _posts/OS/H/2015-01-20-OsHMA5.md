## Key message
1. __root__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper Cu concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage
2. __root__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsHMA5 was mainly expressed in the roots at the vegetative stage but also in nodes, peduncle, rachis, and husk at the reproductive stage
3. __root__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk
4. __root__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, OsHMA5 is involved in loading Cu to the xylem of the roots and other organs
5. __reproductive__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsHMA5 was mainly expressed in the roots at the vegetative stage but also in nodes, peduncle, rachis, and husk at the reproductive stage
6. __xylem__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk

9. __shoot__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper Cu concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage
10. __growth__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Expression of OsHMA5 in a Cu transport-defective mutant yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain restored the growth
11. __vascular bundle__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk
12. __vegetative__, [A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper Cu concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage
