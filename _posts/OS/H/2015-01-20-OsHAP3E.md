* **Key message**  
    + The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants showed various abnormal morphologies both in their vegetative and reproductive phases
    + The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants were dwarf with erected leaves and similar to brassinosteroid mutants in the vegetative phase
    + Altogether, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice
    + Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice
    + These phenotypes indicate association of OsHAP3E with determination of floral meristem identity
    + OsLEC1/OsHAP3E participates in the determination of meristem identity in both vegetative and reproductive developments of rice
