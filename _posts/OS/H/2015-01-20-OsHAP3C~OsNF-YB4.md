* **Key message**  
    + All these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsNF-YB4 in the hybrid rice activates flowering early and improves photosynthesis resulting in better grain yield with shorter growth period
    + Overexpression of OsNF-YB4 leads to flowering early, improving photosynthesis and better grain yield in hybrid rice.
    + In this study, flowering early was observed in the hybrid rice with overexpression of OsNF-YB4
