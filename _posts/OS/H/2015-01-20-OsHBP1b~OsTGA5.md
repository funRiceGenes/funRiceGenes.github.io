* **Key message**  
    + As compared to the WT tobacco plants, the transgenic plants ectopically expressing OsHBP1b showed better survival and favourable osmotic parameters (such as germination and survival rate, membrane stability, K(+)/Na(+) ratio, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage and proline contents) under salinity and drought stress
    + qRT-PCR based expression studies for OsHBP1b in seedlings of contrasting genotypes of rice showed its differential regulation in response to salinity stress
    + Taken together, our findings suggest that OsHBP1b contributes to abiotic stress tolerance through multiple physiological pathways and thus, may serve as a useful 'candidate gene' for improving multiple stress tolerance in crop plants
    + In the present study, we over-express the full-length gene encoding OsHBP1b in the homologous system (rice) to assess its contribution towards multiple stress tolerance and grain yield
    + Recently, we have reported the characterization of OsHBP1b in relation to salinity and drought tolerance in a model system tobacco
    + We provide evidence to show that transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsHBP1b exhibit better survival and favourable osmotic parameters under salinity stress than the wild type counterparts
    + Phosphorylation of OsTGA5 by casein kinase II compromises its suppression of defense-related gene transcription in rice.
    + Importantly, we showed that the nucleus-localized casein kinase II (CK2) complex interacts with and phosphorylates OsTGA5 on Ser-32, which reduces the affinity of OsTGA5 for the JIOsPR10 promoter, thereby alleviating the repression of JIOsPR10 transcription and increasing rice resistance
    + In this study, we characterized the role of OsTGA5 as a negative regulator of rice resistance against blast fungus by transcriptionally repressing the expression of various defense-related genes
    + Moreover, OsTGA5 repressed PTI responses and the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid
    + Furthermore, the in vivo phosphorylation of OsTGA5 Ser-32 was enhanced by blast fungus infection
    + Taken together, our results provide a mechanism for the role of OsTGA5 in negatively regulating the transcription of defense-related genes in rice and the repressive switch imposed by nuclear CK2-mediated phosphorylation during blast fungus invasion
