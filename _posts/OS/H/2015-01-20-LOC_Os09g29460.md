* **Key message**  
    + Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
    + Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses
    + Over-expression of Oshox4 in rice induced a semi-dwarf phenotype that could not be complemented by applied GA3
    + Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants
    + These data together suggest that Oshox4 may be involved in the negative regulation of GA signalling and may play a role to fine tune GA responses in rice
