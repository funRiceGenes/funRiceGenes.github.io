## Key message
1. __domestication__, [Mutations that cause amino acid substitutions at the invariant positions in homeodomain of OSH3 KNOX protein suggest artificial selection during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations that cause amino acid substitutions at the invariant positions in homeodomain of OSH3 KNOX protein suggest artificial selection during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  The facts that these substitutions occurred specifically at the functionally important amino acids and the sequences are conserved in intron where neutral mutations accumulate suggest the substitutions at the invariant positions of OSH3 have been fixed by artificial selections during domestication
2. __domestication__, [Mutations that cause amino acid substitutions at the invariant positions in homeodomain of OSH3 KNOX protein suggest artificial selection during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations that cause amino acid substitutions at the invariant positions in homeodomain of OSH3 KNOX protein suggest artificial selection during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D),  Based on these observations, we hypothesize that OSH3 is responsible for one of the traits that are selectively introduced during the domestication of most of Japonica and a part of Javanica type of rice
