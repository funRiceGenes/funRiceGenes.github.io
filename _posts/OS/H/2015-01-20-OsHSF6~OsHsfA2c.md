## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D)),  The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
2. __transcription factor__, [Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that OsHSF6 was a class A heat shock factor (HSF) with all the conserved sequence elements characteristic of heat stress transcription factor, while OsHSF12 was a class B HSF with C-terminal domain (CTD) lacking of AHA motif
3. __root__, [Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L%5BTitle%5D)),  The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
