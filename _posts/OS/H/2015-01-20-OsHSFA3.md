    + Rice OsHSFA3 Gene Improves Drought Tolerance by Modulating Polyamine Biosynthesis Depending on Abscisic Acid and ROS Levels.
    + Herein, we cloned the OsHSFA3 from rice and overexpressed it in Arabidopsis thaliana to study its regulatory mechanism of drought tolerance
    + Phenotypic and physiological assays of the transgenic Arabidopsis lines showed that overexpression of OsHSFA3 confers drought tolerance by reducing water loss and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, whereas it increases abscisic acid (ABA) levels
    + Overall, this study reveals that OsHSFA3 improves drought tolerance in Arabidopsis not only by increasing ABA levels, but also by modulating polyamine levels to maintain ROS homeostasis, therefore it could be a strong candidate to develop drought-tolerant rice cultivars
