* **Key message**  
    + These data suggest that OSH6-Ds interferes with a developmental mechanism involved in bract differentiation, especially at the basal nodes of panicles
    + A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice
    + The truncated mRNA was expressed ectopically in leaf tissues and encoded the N-terminal region of OSH6, which includes the KNOX1 and partial KNOX2 subdomains
    + These phenotypes distinguished it from the OSH6 transgene whose ectopic expression led to a blade to sheath transformation phenotype at the midrib region of leaves, similar to that seen in dominant Lg3 mutants
