* **Key message**  
    + The overexpression leads to a range of novel phenotypes, involving increased growth rate and altered plant architecture, suggesting that OsHDAC1 functions in the genome-wide programming of gene expression
    + Structure and expression of the rice class-I type histone deacetylase genesOsHDAC1-3:OsHDAC1overexpression in transgenic plants leads to increased growth rate and altered architecture
    + We have previously isolated a rice gene encoding a histone deacetylase, OsHDAC1, and observed that its transgenic overexpression increases seedling root growth
    + To identify the transcriptional repression events that occur as a result of OsHDAC1 overexpression (OsHDAC1(OE)), a global profiling of root-expressed genes was performed on OsHDAC1(OE) or HDAC inhibitor-treated non-transgenic (NT) roots, in comparison with untreated NT roots
    + We selected 39 genes that are induced and repressed in HDAC inhibitor-treated NT and OsHDAC1(OE) roots, compared with NT roots, respectively
    + The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
    + Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings
    + These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
    + The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice
    + OsHDAC1 was expressed at similar levels in the leaves, roots, and callus cells, whereas OsHDAC2 and 3 were expressed in the roots and callus cells, but not in the leaves, exhibiting distinct tissue specificity
