    + Rice sodium-insensitive potassium transporter, OsHAK5, confers increased salt tolerance in tobacco BY2 cells
    + These results suggest that the plasma-membrane localized Na(+) insensitive K(+) transporters, similar to OsHAK5 identified here, could be used as a tool to enhance salt tolerance in plant cells
    + Here, in search for Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter for this purpose, bacterial expression system was used to characterize two K(+) transporters, OsHAK2 and OsHAK5, isolated from rice (Oryza sativa cv
    + Under the condition with a large amount of extracellular Na(+), we found that OsHAK5 functions as a Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter, while OsHAK2 is sensitive to extracellular Na(+) and exhibits higher Na(+) over K(+) transport activities
    + The contribution of OsHAK5 to K mobilization within the rice plant was confirmed further by the change of K concentration in the xylem sap and K distribution in the transgenic lines when K was removed completely from the external solution
    + A Î²-glucuronidase reporter driven by the OsHAK5 native promoter indicated OsHAK5 expression in various tissue organs from root to seed, abundantly in root epidermis and stele, the vascular tissues, and mesophyll cells
    + Overexpression of OsHAK5 increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of OsHAK5 decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress
    + The role of a potassium transporter OsHAK5 in potassium acquisition and transport from roots to shoots in rice at low potassium supply levels.
    + Here, we show that inactivation of OsHAK5, a rice K+ transporter gene, decreased rootward and shootward PAT, tiller number, and the length of both lateral roots and root hairs, while OsHAK5 overexpression increased PAT, tiller number, and root hair length, irrespective of the K+ supply
    + The Potassium Transporter OsHAK5 Alters Rice Architecture via ATP-Dependent Transmembrane Auxin Fluxes
    + These findings highlight the dual roles of OsHAK5 in altering cellular chemiosmotic gradients (generated continuously by PM H+-ATPase) and regulating ATP-dependent auxin transport
    + Both functions may underlie the prominent effect of OsHAK5 on rice architecture, which may be exploited in the future to increase crop yield via genetic manipulations
