* **Key message**  
    + Differential Regulation of an OsIspH1, the Functional 4-Hydroxy-3-Methylbut-2-Enyl Diphosphate Reductase, for Photosynthetic Pigment Biosynthesis in Rice Leaves and Seeds
    + It confirmed the crucial role of OsIspH1 in plastidic terpenoid biosynthesis, revealing organ-specific differential regulation of OsIspH1 in rice plants.
