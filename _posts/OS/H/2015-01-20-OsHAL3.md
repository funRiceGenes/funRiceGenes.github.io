* **Key message**  
    + OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice
    + Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity
    + OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light

    + __Hd1__, __OsHAL3__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D), We conclude that OsHAL3, a novel light responsive protein, plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice, which is probably mediated by forming a complex with Hd1
    + __Hd3a__, __OsHAL3__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D), Moreover, OsHAL3 directly bound to the promoter of Hd3a, especially before dawn
