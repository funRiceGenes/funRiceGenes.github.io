* **Key message**  
    + OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice
    + Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity
    + OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light
    + Meanwhile, we demonstrated that STH1 forms a protein complex with D3 and a vital regulatory factor in salt tolerance, OsHAL3, to regulate the protein abundance of OsHAL3 via the 26S proteasome pathway
