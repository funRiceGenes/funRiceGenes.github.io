* **Key message**  
    + The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
    + Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that OsHSF6 was a class A heat shock factor (HSF) with all the conserved sequence elements characteristic of heat stress transcription factor, while OsHSF12 was a class B HSF with C-terminal domain (CTD) lacking of AHA motif
    + Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.
