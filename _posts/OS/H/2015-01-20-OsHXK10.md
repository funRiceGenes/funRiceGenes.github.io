1. __grain filling__, [RNAi-mediated suppression of hexokinase gene OsHXK10 in rice leads to non-dehiscent anther and reduction of pollen germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated suppression of hexokinase gene OsHXK10 in rice leads to non-dehiscent anther and reduction of pollen germination%5BTitle%5D)),  The results demonstrate that OsHXK10 plays an essential role in anther dehiscence, pollen germination and hence grain filling in rice
2. __growth__, [Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  To investigate the roles of hexokinases in rice growth and development, we analyzed rice sequence databases and isolated ten rice hexokinase cDNAs, OsHXK1 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 1) through OsHXK10
