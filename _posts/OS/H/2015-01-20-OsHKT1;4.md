* **Key message**  
    + For OsHKT1;4, alternative splicing of transcript and the anatomical complexity of the sheath needed to be taken into account
    + Thus, Na(+) accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced OsHKT1;4 transcript in a corresponding sheath
    + The level of OsHKT1;4 transcripts was prominent in leaf sheaths throughout the growth stages
    + Taken together, our results indicate a newly recognized function of OsHKT1;4 in Na(+) exclusion in stems together with leaf sheaths, thus excluding Na(+) from leaf blades of a japonica rice cultivar in the reproductive growth stage, but the contribution is low when the plants are in the vegetative growth stage
    + In addition, (22)Na(+) tracer experiments using peduncles of RNAi and WT plants suggested xylem Na(+) unloading by OsHKT1;4
    + Unexpectedly however, we demonstrate here accumulation of OsHKT1;4 transcripts in the stem including internode II and peduncle in the reproductive growth stage
    + Moreover, phenotypic analysis of OsHKT1;4 RNAi plants in the vegetative growth stage revealed no profound influence on the growth and ion accumulation in comparison with WT plants upon salinity stress
    + Here, we report results of the functional characterization of the OsHKT1;4 transporter in rice
    + T-DNA Tagging-Based Gain-of-Function of OsHKT1;4 Reinforces Na Exclusion from Leaves and Stems but Triggers Na Toxicity in Roots of Rice Under Salt Stress.
    + Here, we have characterized a transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant line of rice, which overexpresses OsHKT1;4, owing to enhancer elements in the T-DNA, to gain an insight into the impact of OsHKT1;4 on salt tolerance of rice
    + We observed that progressive desalinization of the xylem sap along its ascent to the leaf blades still occurred in plants grown at submillimolar Na+ concentration, and that OsHKT1;4 was involved in reducing xylem sap Na+ concentration in roots in these conditions too
    + Constitutive Contribution by the Rice OsHKT1;4 Na + Transporter to Xylem Sap Desalinization and Low Na + Accumulation in Young Leaves Under Low as High External Na + Conditions
    + By analyzing transgenic rice plants expressing a GUS reporter gene construct, we observed that OsHKT1;4 is mainly expressed in xylem parenchyma in both roots and leaves
    + Using mutant lines expressing artificial microRNA that selectively reduced OsHKT1;4 expression, the involvement of OsHKT1;4 in retrieving Na+ from the xylem sap in the roots upon salt stress was evidenced
    + Three rice HKT genes, OsHKT1;1, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5, are known to contribute to salt tolerance by reducing Na+ accumulation in shoots upon salt stress
    + Since OsHKT1;4 was found to be also well expressed in the roots in absence of salt stress, we extended the analysis of its role when plants were subjected to non-toxic Na+ conditions (0
    + Here, we further investigate the mechanisms by which OsHKT1;4 contributes to this process and extend this analysis to the role of this transporter in plants in presence of low Na+ concentrations
