* **Key message**  
    + The present study suggests that the D1 fragment of OsHyPRP16 promoter is a valuable tool for breeding and development of rice lines with early-inducible and pathogen-responsive enhanced disease resistance
    + Stress responsive OsHyPRP16 promoter driven early expression of resistance gene Pi54 potentiate the resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae in transgenic rice.
    + The rice Hybrid Proline Rich Protein (HyPRP) encoding gene, OsHyPRP16 expression exhibit early upregulation in response to Magnaporthe oryzae inoculation
