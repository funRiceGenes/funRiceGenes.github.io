* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + At the seedling stage, we identified heat-sensitive mutants that carried T-DNA inserted into a heat shock protein 70 gene, OsHsp70CP1
    + This indicated that OsHsp70CP1 is essential for chloroplast differentiation from the proplastids under high temperatures
    + Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions
