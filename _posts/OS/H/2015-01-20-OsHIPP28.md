    + [A small secreted protein, RsMf8HN, in Rhizoctonia solani triggers plant immune response, which interacts with rice OsHIPP28.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A small secreted protein, RsMf8HN, in Rhizoctonia solani triggers plant immune response, which interacts with rice OsHIPP28.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, Microbiol Res.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We confirmed the occurrence of in vivo cross-interactions of RsMf8HN with a rice molecule, the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein OsHIPP28, which is a protein related to the disease susceptibility factor Pi21.
