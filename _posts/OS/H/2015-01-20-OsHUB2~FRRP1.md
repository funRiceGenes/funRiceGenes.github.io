* **Key message**  
    + Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.
    + OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae
    + Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity
    + In conclusion, FRRP1 probably regulates flowering time and yield potential in rice by affecting histone H2B monoubiquitination, which leads to changes in gene expression in multiple processes
