* **Key message**  
    + OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves
    + Antisense expression of OsPLDalpha4 and -alpha5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2)
    + OsHPL3 positively modulates resistance to the rice brown planthopper [BPH, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal)] but negatively modulates resistance to the rice striped stem borer [SSB, Chilo suppressalis (Walker)]
    + Here, we describe identification of a role for the rice HPL3 gene, which encodes a hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), OsHPL3/CYP74B2, in mediating plant-specific defense responses
    + Collectively, these results indicate that OsHPL3, by affecting the levels of JA, GLVs and other volatiles, modulates rice-specific defense responses against different invaders
    + The rice hydroperoxide lyase OsHPL3 functions in defense responses by modulating the oxylipin pathway
