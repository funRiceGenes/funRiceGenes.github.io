5. __dwarf__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 Oshox4 gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 Oshox4 gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D),  Over-expression of Oshox4 in rice induced a semi-dwarf phenotype that could not be complemented by applied GA3
6. __meristem__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 Oshox4 gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 Oshox4 gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D),  Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
