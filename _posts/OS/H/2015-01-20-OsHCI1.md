* **Key message**  
    + This study found that one rice gene encoding the RING finger protein was specifically induced by heat and cold stress treatments but not by salinity or dehydration and named it OsHCI1 (Oryza sativa heat and cold induced 1)
    + OsHCI1 physically interacted with nuclear substrate proteins including a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
    + In contrast, OsHCI1 may have accumulated in the nucleus under high temperatures
