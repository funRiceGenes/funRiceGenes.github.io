## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cold stress__, ["The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance"%5BTitle%5D),  This study found that one rice gene encoding the RING finger protein was specifically induced by heat and cold stress treatments but not by salinity or dehydration and named it OsHCI1 (Oryza sativa heat and cold induced 1)
2. __transcription factor__, [The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance%5BTitle%5D),  OsHCI1 physically interacted with nuclear substrate proteins including a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
3. __salinity__, ["The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance"%5BTitle%5D),  This study found that one rice gene encoding the RING finger protein was specifically induced by heat and cold stress treatments but not by salinity or dehydration and named it OsHCI1 (Oryza sativa heat and cold induced 1)
4. __temperature__, ["The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance"%5BTitle%5D), " In contrast, OsHCI1 may have accumulated in the nucleus under high temperatures"
