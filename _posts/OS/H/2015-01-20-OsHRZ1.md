## Key message
1. __zinc__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2
