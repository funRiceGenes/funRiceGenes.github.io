* **Key message**  
    + Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsHrd3 interacts with components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex such as OsOS-9 and OsHrd1 in rice protoplasts
    + MAL RNA-interfered (MRi) transgenic plants exhibited a phenotype with shorter crown root length and lower crown root number, accompanied by a lower cell division rate
    + The low division rate was observed in the root meristem exactly where MAL was expressed
    + Furthermore, transcriptome data revealed that cell wall macromolecule metabolism-related genes and redox-related genes were enriched in MAL RNAi lines
