* **Key message**  
    + DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the transgenic plants with the down-regulated genes OsTPKa and OsHAK_like under salt stress supports the assumption that OsTPKa and OsHAK_like play important roles in defending the rice landrace Horkuch against salt stress, minimizing salt injury, and maintaining plant growth
    + These are OsTPKa or Vacuolar two-pore potassium channel and OsHAK_like or a hypothetical protein of the HAK family
