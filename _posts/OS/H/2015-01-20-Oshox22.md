1. __ ABA __, [Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of Oshox22 showed reduced Oshox22 expression and ABA content, decreased sensitivity to ABA, and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the seedling stage
2. __ ABA __, [Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, transgenic rice over-expressing Oshox22 showed increased sensitivity to ABA, increased ABA content, and decreased drought and salt tolerances
