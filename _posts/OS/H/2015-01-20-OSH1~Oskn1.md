* **Key message**  
    + Introduction of the cloned OSH1 gene into rice resulted in altered leaf morphology, which was similar to that of the maize morphological mutant Knotted-1 (Kn1), indicating that OSH1 is a rice gene homologous to the maize Kn1 gene
    + Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs
    + RNA in situ localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem
    + We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages
    + Rapid and random leaf production in sho mutants is correlated with the frequent and disorganized cell divisions in the shoot meristem and with a reduction of expression domain of a rice homeobox gene, OSH1
    + Interestingly, loss-of-function mutants of OSH1 lose the SAM just after germination but can be rescued to grow until reproductive development when they are regenerated from callus
    + Here we report the results of our analysis on the regulatory mechanism(s) ofOSH1 on GA metabolism
    + The internal GA1 and GA20 contents inOSH1-transformed tobacco were dramatically reduced compared with those of wild-type plants, whereas the level of GA19, a mid-product of GA 20-oxidase, was 25% of the wild-type level
    + RNA-blot analysis revealed that GA 20-oxidase gene expression was suppressed in stem tissue of OSH1-transformed tobacco plants
    + Based on these results, we conclude that overexpression ofOSH1 causes a reduction of the level of GA1by suppressing GA 20-oxidase expression
    + Decreased GA1 Content Caused by the Overexpression of OSH1 Is Accompanied by Suppression of GA 20-Oxidase Gene Expression
    + In the normal shoot-regeneration process of calli, expression of endogenous OSH1 was restricted in presumptive shoot-regenerating regions of calli and not observed in other areas
    + A 5' upstream region of OSH1 had the ability to direct the expression of a reporter gene in leaf in addition to the SAM
    + Introduction of OSH1 cDNA without a promoter sequence caused ectopic expression of both endogenous OSH1 and introduced OSH1 cDNA itself into the leaf, which resulted in morphological abnormalities in the leaf resembling those of the overexpressors
    + These results indicate that an extra copy of OSH1 exons with no promoter sequence disrupts suppression of OSH1 in the transgenic leaf
    + Consistent with this result, OSH1, a molecular marker of meristematic indeterminate cells in rice, continues to be expressed in this region
    + In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation
    + In situ hybridization analysis revealed that in the wild-type embryo, OSH1 was first expressed at the globular stage, much earlier than organogenesis started, in a ventral region where shoot apical meristem and epiblast would later develop
    + At later stages after organogenesis had initiated, OSH1 expression was observed in shoot apical meristem [except in the L1 (tunica) layer], epiblast, radicle, and their intervening tissues in descending strength of expression level with embryonic maturation
    + We report that a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1) represses the brassinosteroid (BR) phytohormone pathway through activation of BR catabolism genes.
