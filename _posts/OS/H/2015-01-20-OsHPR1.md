## Connection
1. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we constructed overexpression of the OsHPR1 gene and RNA interference plants of OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 genes in rice (Oryza sativa L
2. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings demonstrate that two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice
3. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice
4. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Results from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and enzyme assays showed that HPR1 activity changed significantly in corresponding transgenic lines without any effect on HPR2 activity, which is the same for HPR2
5. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, HPR1 and HPR2 proteins were located to the peroxisome and cytosol, respectively, by transient expression experiment
6. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Double mutant hpr1 x hpr2 was generated by crossing individual mutant of hpr1 and hpr2
7. __OsHPR1__, __OsHPR2__, [Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The phenotype typical of photorespiration mutants was observed only where activity of both HPR1 and HPR2 were downregulated in the same line
