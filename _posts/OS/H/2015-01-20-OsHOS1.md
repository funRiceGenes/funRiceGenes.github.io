* **Key message**  
    + To address this issue, we have identified a rice E3-ubiquitin ligase, OsHOS1, and characterized its role in the modulation of the cold stress response
    + Taken together our results confirm the importance of OsHOS1, and thus of the proteasome, in the modulation of the cold stress signalling in rice
    + Isolation and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L.) E3-ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 gene in the modulation of cold stress response
    + The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors.
    + The morphological analysis of the roots in transgenic RNAi::OsHOS1 (RNA interference) and wild type (WT) plants, exposed to a mechanical barrier, revealed that the OsHOS1 silencing plants keep a straight root in contrast to WT that exhibit root curling
    + Using the yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ERF transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression
    + We showed that OsHOS1 is involved in the regulation of root curling after mechanosensing and that RNAi::OsHOS1 plants failed to exhibit the root curling phenotype observed in WT
    + Altogether, our results highlight the role of the proteasome modulating plant responses to mechanical stimuli and suggest that OsHOS1 is a hub integrating environmental and hormonal signaling into plant growth and development
