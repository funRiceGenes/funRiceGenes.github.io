## Expression information
__Expression__:The rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 modulates the expression of OsRMC, a gene involved in root mechano-sensing, through the interaction with two ERF transcription factors. |  The straight root phenotype of the RNAi::OsHOS1 plants was correlated with a higher expression of OsRMC rice ROOT MEANDER CURLING), which encodes a receptor-like kinase characterized as a negative regulator of rice root curling mediated by JA |  Using the yeast two-hybrid system and BiFC assays we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ERF transcription factors TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: The morphological analysis of the roots in transgenic RNAi::OsHOS1 RNA interference and wild type WT plants, exposed to a mechanical barrier, revealed that the OsHOS1 silencing plants keep a straight root in contrast to WT that exhibit root curling |  The straight root phenotype of the RNAi::OsHOS1 plants was correlated with a higher expression of OsRMC rice ROOT MEANDER CURLING), which encodes a receptor-like kinase characterized as a negative regulator of rice root curling mediated by JA
