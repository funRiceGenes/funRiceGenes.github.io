    + __OsHIPP19__, __Pik-1__, [Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence%5BTitle%5D),  We define the biochemical and structural basis of the interaction between AVR-Pik and OsHIPP19, and compare the interaction to that formed with the HMA domain of Pik-1
    + __OsHIPP19__, __Pik-1__, [Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence%5BTitle%5D),  Using analytical gel filtration and surface plasmon resonance, we show that multiple AVR-Pik variants, including the stealthy variants AVR-PikC and AVR-PikF which do not interact with any characterised Pik-1 alleles, bind to OsHIPP19 with nanomolar affinity
    + __OsHIPP19__, __Pik-1__, [Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Multiple variants of the fungal effector AVR-Pik bind the HMA domain of the rice protein OsHIPP19, providing a foundation to engineer plant defence%5BTitle%5D),  The crystal structure of OsHIPP19 in complex with AVR-PikF reveals differences at the interface that underpin high-affinity binding of OsHIPP19-HMA to a wider set of AVR-Pik variants than achieved by the integrated HMA domain of Pik-1
