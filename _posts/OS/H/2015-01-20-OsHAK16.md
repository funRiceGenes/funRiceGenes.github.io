* **Key message**  
    + The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress
    + OsHAK16 knockout (KO) dramatically reduced root K net uptake rate and growth at both 0
    + OsHAK16 disruption decreased while its overexpression increased K concentration in root slightly but in shoot remarkably
    + 1 mM and 1 mM K supplies, while OsHAK16 overexpression (OX) increased total K uptake and growth only at 0
    + Expression of OsHAK16 enhanced the growth of high salt-sensitive yeast mutant by increasing its K but no Na content
    + OsHAK16 mediates K uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in a broad range of external K concentrations, thereby contributing to the maintenance of K homeostasis and salt tolerance in the rice shoot
    + Taking all these together, we conclude that OsHAK16 plays crucial roles in maintaining K homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice shoot
    + Rice OsHAK16 functions in potassium uptake and translocation in shoot, maintaining potassium homeostasis and salt tolerance.
    + Transcriptional expression of OsHAK16 was up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress
    + OsHAK16 is localized at the plasma membrane
