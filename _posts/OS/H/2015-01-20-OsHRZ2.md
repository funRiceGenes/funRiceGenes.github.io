1. __zinc__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene RING- and Zinc-finger protein 1 OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2
2. __zinc__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D),  OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
3. __iron__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene RING- and Zinc-finger protein 1 OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2
