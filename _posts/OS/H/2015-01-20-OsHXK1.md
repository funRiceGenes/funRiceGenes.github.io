* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsHXK1 also resulted in the overaccumulation of ROS, premature initiation of PCD, and pollen abortion
    + Moreover, knockdown of OsHXK1 restored pollen fertility in OsAGO2 knockdown plants
    + OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.
    + These results indicate that OsHXK1 controls the appropriate production of ROS and the proper timing of tapetal PCD and is directly regulated by OsAGO2 through epigenetic regulation
