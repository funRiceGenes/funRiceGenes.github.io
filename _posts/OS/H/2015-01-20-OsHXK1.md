* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsHXK1 also resulted in the overaccumulation of ROS, premature initiation of PCD, and pollen abortion
    + Moreover, knockdown of OsHXK1 restored pollen fertility in OsAGO2 knockdown plants
    + OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.
    + These results indicate that OsHXK1 controls the appropriate production of ROS and the proper timing of tapetal PCD and is directly regulated by OsAGO2 through epigenetic regulation
    + They also revealed the important roles of OsHXK1 in the regulation of rice yield and photosynthesis
    + Improving the Rice Photosynthetic Efficiency and Yield by Editing OsHXK1 via CRISPR/Cas9 System
    + Hexokinase gene OsHXK1 positively regulates leaf senescence in rice.
    + CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the outcomes of this study suggested that OsHXK1 could act as a positive regulator of rice leaf senescence by mediating glucose accumulation and inducing an increase in ROS
    + The upregulation of OsHXK1 led to premature senescence of rice leaves, a decreased level of chlorophyll, and damage to the chloroplast structure
    + The overexpression of OsHXK1 resulted in increases in glucose and ROS levels and produced programmed cell death (PCD) signals earlier at the booting stage
    + OsHXK1 acts as a positive regulator of blast disease resistance that OsHXK1-OE rice exhibited enhanced resistance, whereas Cas9-Oshxk1 rice showed reduced resistance, against M
    + OsHXK1 may function through its sugar sensor activity since glucose induced defense-related gene expression and ROS accumulation in Nipponbare and OsHXK1-OE but not in Cas9-Oshxk1 rice
