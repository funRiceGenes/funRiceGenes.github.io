* **Key message**  
    + OsHMA2 was mainly expressed in the mature zone of the roots at the vegetative stage, but higher expression was also found in the nodes at the reproductive stage
    + OsHMA2 was localized at the pericycle of the roots and at the phloem of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes
    + The translocation ratios of zinc (Zn) and Cd were clearly lower in all mutants than in the wild type, suggesting that OsHMA2 is a major transporter of Zn and Cd from roots to shoots
    + In silico search and preliminary analyses in yeast suggest OsHMA2 as a good candidate for the control of Cd xylem loading in rice
    + Heterologous expression of OsHMA2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed influx transport activity for zinc as well as cadmium
    + Taken together, OsHMA2 in the nodes plays an important role in preferential distribution of zinc as well as cadmium through the phloem to the developing tissues
    + The yeast expressing OsHMA2 was able to reverse the growth defect in the presence of excess Zn
    + These results suggest that OsHMA2 plays a role in Zn and Cd loading to the xylem and participates in root-to-shoot translocation of these metals in rice
    + Here we investigated the role of the Zn/Cd transporter OsHMA2
    + The OsHMA2 transporter is involved in root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and Cd in rice
    + Mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase 2 (OsHMA2) restrict the translocation of zinc and cadmium
    + The expression of OsHMA2 in rice was observed mainly in the roots where OsHMA2 transcripts were abundant in vascular bundles
    + Furthermore, Zn and Cd concentrations of OsHMA2-suppressed rice decreased in the leaves, while the Zn concentration increased in the roots compared with the wild type (WT)
    + Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase2 (OsHMA2), a member of P-type ATPases, is involved in preferential delivery of zinc to the developing tissues in rice
    + Preferential delivery of zinc to developing tissues in rice is mediated by P-type heavy metal ATPase OsHMA2
    + Furthermore, the Cd concentration in the grains of OsHMA2-overexpressing rice as well as in OsSUT1-promoter OsHMA2 rice decreased to about half that of the WT, although the other metal concentrations were the same as in the WT
    + By comparing each allele in the OsHMA2 protein structure and measuring the Cd translocation ratio, we identified the C-terminal region as essential for Cd translocation into shoots
    + Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.
    + These results indicate that expression of OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues
    + The aim of this study is to manipulate both expression and tissue localization of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter in the roots by expressing it under the control of OsHMA2 promoter, which shows high expression in different organs including roots, nodes and shoots
