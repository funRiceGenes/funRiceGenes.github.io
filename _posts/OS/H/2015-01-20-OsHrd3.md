## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D),  Since Hrd3/SEL1L recognizes unfolded proteins in yeast and mammalian protein quality control systems, the role of OsHrd3 in protein quality control in rice endosperm was investigated
2. __Ubiquitin__, [OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D),  Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsHrd3 interacts with components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex such as OsOS-9 and OsHrd1 in rice protoplasts
3. __quality__, [OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D), OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.

5. __quality__, [OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D),  Endosperm-specific suppression of OsHrd3 in transgenic rice reduced the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and resulted in unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endosperm, suggesting that OsHrd3-mediated polyubiquitination plays an important role in ER quality control
