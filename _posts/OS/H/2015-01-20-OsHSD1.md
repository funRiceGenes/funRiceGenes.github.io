* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here we report a wax-deficient rice mutant oshsd1 with reduced epicuticular wax crystals and thicker cuticle membrane
    + Together, our data indicated that OsHSD1 plays a specialized role in cuticle formation and lipid homeostasis, probably by mediating sterol signaling
    + Furthermore, OsHSD1 mutation resulted in faster protein degradation, but had no effect on the dehydrogenase activity
