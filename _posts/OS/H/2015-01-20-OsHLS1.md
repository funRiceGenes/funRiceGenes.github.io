* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified a gene related to plant height, leaf, and premature senescence in rice, and named it OsHLS1
    + OsHLS1 regulates plant height and development by controlling active gibberellin accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + OsHLS1 affected the expression levels of genes involved in the GA metabolic pathway and affected the content of active GA, thereby regulating plant height development in rice
    + In conclusion, we suggest that OsHLS1 regulates plant height and development by controlling the accumulation of active gibberellins in rice
    + Subcellular localization showed that OsHLS1 was located in the nucleus
    + Expression of OsHLS1 was significantly brought about by gibberellin (GA)
