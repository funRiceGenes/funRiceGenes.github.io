    + Characterization of Rice Homeobox Genes, OsHOX22 and OsHOX24, and Over-expression of OsHOX24 in Transgenic Arabidopsis Suggest Their Role in Abiotic Stress Response.
    + Over-expression of OsHOX24 imparted higher sensitivity to stress hormone, ABA, and abiotic stresses in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants as revealed by various physiological and phenotypic assays
    + In this study, we carried out functional analysis of two candidate stress-responsive HD-ZIP I class homeobox genes from rice, OsHOX22, and OsHOX24
    + OsHOX24 over-expression rice seedlings showed reduced root and shoot growth under salinity and desiccation stress (DS) conditions
    + In the present study, we raised rice transgenics over-expressing stress-responsive OsHOX24 gene (rice homeodomain-leucine zipper I sub-family member) and analyzed their response to various abiotic stresses at different stages of development
    + At the seed germination stage, rice transgenics over-expressing OsHOX24 exhibited enhanced sensitivity to abiotic stress conditions and abscisic acid as compared to wild-type (WT)
    + Over-Expression of OsHOX24 Confers Enhanced Susceptibility to Abiotic Stresses in Transgenic Rice via Modulating Stress-Responsive Gene Expression.
    + Taken together, our findings highlighted the role of OsHOX24 in regulation of abiotic stress responses via modulating the expression of stress-responsive genes in rice
    + OsHOX24 mediates regulation of desiccation stress response via complex regulatory network as indicated by its binding to several target genes including transcription factors in rice
    + Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that OsHOX24 direct target genes were involved in several biological processes, including plant development, ABA-mediated signalling pathway, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, ion transport, abiotic and biotic stress responses besides transcriptional and translational regulation
    + In this study, we identified downstream targets of OsHOX24 under control and desiccation stress conditions via chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) approach in wild-type and OsHOX24 over-expression transgenic in rice
