* **Key message**  
    + Among 5 A2-type HSF genes encoded in the rice genome, four genes, including OsHsfA2e, are induced by high temperatures in rice seedlings
    + These observations suggest that the OsHsfA2e may be useful in molecular breeding designed to improve the environmental stress tolerance of crops
    + The rice cDNA inserted in R04333 encodes OsHsfA2e, a member of the heat stress transcription factors
