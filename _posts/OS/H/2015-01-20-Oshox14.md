* **Key message**  
    + Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.
    + Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype
    + In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion
    + Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development
