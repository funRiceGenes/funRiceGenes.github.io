* **Key message**  
    + The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed
    + Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue
    + The expression of the single copy OsHFP gene was detected in rice flower buds
