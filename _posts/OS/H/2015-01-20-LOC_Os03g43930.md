* **Key message**  
    + Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development
    + Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles
    + Overexpression of OsHox32 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Plant Type Architecture and Leaf Development in Rice.
    + OsHox32 exhibited constitutive expression in different organs, with higher mRNA levels in the stem, leaf sheath, shoot apical meristems and young roots, suggesting a role in plant-type and leaf development
    + mRNA level of six rice YABBY genes is up-regulated or down-regulated by OsHox32, suggesting that OsHox32 may regulate the architecture of plant type and leaf development by controlling the expression of YABBY genes in rice
    + Molecular analyses revealed OsHB4, a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166 and overexpression of miR166-resistant OsHB4 resulted in rice plants resembling the STTM166 lines, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance
    + Overexpression of miR166b (OE166b) in rice plants or knocking down of OsHox32 by RNA interference (RNAiHox32) led to increased thickness of cell walls and enhanced mechanical strength of culms
