* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we reported the first rice deg mutant tcm5 (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 5) that has an albino phenotype, defective chloroplasts and could not survive after the 4-5 leaf seedling stage when grown at high temperature (32 °C)
    + The TCM5 encodes chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein which is important for chloroplast development and the maintenance of PSII function and its disruption would lead to a defective chloroplast and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis at early rice seedling stage under high temperatures
    + The Rice TCM5 Gene Encoding a Novel Deg Protease Protein is Essential for Chloroplast Development under High Temperatures.
    + In tcm5 mutants grown at high temperatures, the transcript levels of certain genes associated with chloroplast development especially PSII-associated genes were severely affected, but recovered to normal levels at low temperatures
    + These results showed important role of TCM5 for chloroplast development under high temperatures
    + Map-based cloning showed that TCM5 encoding a chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein
