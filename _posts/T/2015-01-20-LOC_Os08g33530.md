    + Natural Variations at TIG1 Encoding a TCP Transcription Factor Contribute to Plant Architecture Domestication in Rice.
    + Variations in the tig1 promoter of indica cultivars led to decreased expression of TIG1 in the far-land side of tiller base, reduced cell length and tiller angle, which led to the transition from inclined growth tiller of wild rice to the erect growth tiller during rice domestication
    + The TIG1 mRNA is primarily enriched in the far-land side of tiller base, promotes cell elongation and enlarges the tiller angle in wild rice
    + The TIG1 protein activates the expression of EXPA3, EXPB5 and SAUR39 to regulate cell elongation and increase the tiller angle
    + The cloning of TIG1 supports a new scenario of plant architecture evolution in rice
