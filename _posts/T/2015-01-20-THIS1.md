* **Key message**  
    + This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1)
    + THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
    + Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation
    + The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening
    + In the this1 mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages
    + Thus, This1 provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development
    + Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control
    + The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that This1 is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin
    + Histological analyses showed that the mutation in this1 resulted in anisotropic cell expansion and cell division
