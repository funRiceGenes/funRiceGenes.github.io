## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters
2. __transporter__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid
3. __iron__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency
4. __root__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency

## Connection
1. __TOM1~OsZIFL4__, __TOM2__, [The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In the present study, we analyzed TOM2 and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil
2. __TOM1~OsZIFL4__, __TOM3__, [The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In the present study, we analyzed TOM2 and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil
