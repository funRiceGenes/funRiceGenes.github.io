* **Key message**  
    + Consequently, tps46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids
    + Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of EÎ²f and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of tps46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against R
    + CONCLUSION: The findings provide a new promoter and a new cis-regulatory sequence tool for the research on and application of rice BPH resistance genes, as well as a new perspective for functional analysis of the OsTPS31 gene
