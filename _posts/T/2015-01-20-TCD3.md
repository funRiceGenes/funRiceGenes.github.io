* **Key message**  
    + Chloroplast development at low temperature requires the pseudouridine synthase gene TCD3 in rice
    + The disruption of TCD3 severely affected the transcript levels of various chloroplast-associated genes, as well as ribosomal genes involved in chloroplast rRNA assembly at low temperature (20<U+2009><a1><e3>C), whereas the transcript levels of these genes were normal at high temperature (32<U+2009><a1><e3>C)
    + Map-based cloning, complementation and knockout tests revealed that TCD3 encodes a chloroplast-localized <a6><b7> synthase
