## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Strong TOM2 expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, while TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation |  Transgenic rice in which TOM2 expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared to non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
