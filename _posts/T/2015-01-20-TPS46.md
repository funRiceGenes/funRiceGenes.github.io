* **Key message**  
    + Consequently, tps46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids
    + Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of E¦Âf and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of tps46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against R
