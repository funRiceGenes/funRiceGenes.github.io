    + __OsCBSX3__, __TLP~PR5__, [Over-Expression of Rice CBS Domain Containing Protein, OsCBSX3, Confers Rice Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae Inoculation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Over-Expression of Rice CBS Domain Containing Protein, OsCBSX3, Confers Rice Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae Inoculation.%5BTitle%5D), Consistently, the over-expression of OsCBSX3 enhances the transcript levels of immunity associated marker genes including PR1a, PR1b, PR5, AOS2, PAL, NH1, and OsWRKY13 in plants inoculated with M
    + __OsWRKY4__, __TLP~PR5__, [Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.%5BTitle%5D), Modulation of OsWRKY4 transcript levels by constitutive overexpression increases resistance to the necrotrophic sheath blight fungus, concomitant with elevated expression of JA- and ET-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR1b, PR5 and PR10/PBZ1
    + __OsWRKY4__, __TLP~PR5__, [Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.%5BTitle%5D), Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements
    + __OsDjA6__, __TLP~PR5__, [The DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D), In addition, the expression levels of WRKY45, NPR1, and PR5 are increased in the OsDjA6 RNAi plants, indicating that OsDjA6 may mediate resistance by affecting the salicylic acid pathway
    + __TLP~PR5__, __TUD1~DSG1~ELF1__, [ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses
