    + Rice TSV3 Encoding Obg-Like GTPase Protein Is Essential for Chloroplast Development During the Early Leaf Stage Under Cold Stress.
    + These observations suggest that the rice nuclear-encoded TSV3 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage under cold stress
    + Expression of TSV3 was high in leaves and weak or undetectable in other tissues, suggesting a tissue-specific expression of TSV3 In the tsv3 mutant, expression levels of genes associated with the biogenesis of the chloroplast ribosome 50S subunit were severely decreased at the 3-leaf-stage under cold stress (20<a1><e3>C), but could be recovered to normal levels at a higher temperature (32<a1><e3>C)
    + Map-based cloning and complementation experiments showed that TSV3 encoded a small GTP-binding protein
