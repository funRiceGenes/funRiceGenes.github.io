## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1%5BTitle%5D),  OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice
2. __erect__, [TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice%5BTitle%5D),  TAC1 was mapped to a 35-kb region on chromosome 9 using a large F2 population from crosses between an indica rice, IR24, which displays a relatively spread-out plant architecture, and an introgressed line, IL55, derived from japonica rice Asominori, which displays a compact plant architecture with extremely erect tillers
3. __shoot__, [Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1%5BTitle%5D),  OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice
