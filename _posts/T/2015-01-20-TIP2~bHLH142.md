    + The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development
    + The tip2 mutants display undifferentiated inner three anther wall layers and abort tapetal programmed cell death, causing complete male sterility
    + Thus, in this study, we identified bHLH142 as having a pivotal role in tapetal programmed cell death and pollen development.
    + bHLH142 regulates various metabolic pathway-related genes to affect pollen development and anther dehiscence in rice.
    + Overexpression of bHLH142 in transgenic rice resulted in indehiscent anthers and aborted pollen grains
    + Overexpression of bHLH142 induced early expression of several key regulatory transcription factors in pollen development
    + Tightly Controlled Expression of bHLH142 Is Essential for Timely Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development in Rice.
    + We previously showed that knockout of bHLH142 in rice (Oryza sativa) causes pollen sterility by interrupting tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and bHLH142 coordinates with TDR to modulate the expression of EAT1
    + Thus, the findings of this study advance our understanding of the central role played by bHLH142 in the regulatory network leading to pollen development in rice and how overexpression of its expression affects pollen development
    + In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of bHLH142 (OE142) under the control of the ubiquitin promoter also leads to male sterility in rice by triggering the premature onset of PCD
    + Exploitation of this novel functionality of bHLH142 may confer a big advantage to hybrid seed production
    + UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development
