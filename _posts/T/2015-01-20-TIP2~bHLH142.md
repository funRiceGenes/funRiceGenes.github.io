* **Key message**  
    + The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development
    + The tip2 mutants display undifferentiated inner three anther wall layers and abort tapetal programmed cell death, causing complete male sterility
    + Thus, in this study, we identified bHLH142 as having a pivotal role in tapetal programmed cell death and pollen development.

* **Connection**  
    + __TDR__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.%5BTitle%5D), We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
    + __DTD~EAT1__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.%5BTitle%5D), We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
    + __TDR__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.%5BTitle%5D), In addition, TIP2 can interact with TDR, indicating a role of TIP2 in later anther development.
    + __TIP2~bHLH142__, __Udt1__, [The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice%5BTitle%5D), bHLH142 acts downstream of UDT1 and GAMYB but upstream of TDR1 and EAT1 in pollen development.
    + __AP37~OsERF3__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice%5BTitle%5D), EAT1 positively regulates the expression of AP37 and AP25, which induce tapetal programmed cell death.
