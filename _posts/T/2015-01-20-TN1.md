* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, these results indicate that TN1 is a tillering regulatory factor whose alleles present apparent preferential utilization across geographical regions
    + Natural variation in TN1 affects its interaction with TIF1 (TN1 interaction factor 1) to affect DWARF14 expression and negatively regulate tiller number in rice
