* **Key message**  
    + Our analysis of the Tid1-1 mutant revealed that the dynamics of microtubules affects not only anisotropic growth in both dicots and monocots, but also meristematic activity and gross plant morphology
    + Here, we report a dominant mutant, Twisted dwarf 1-1 (Tid1-1), showing dwarfism and twisted growth in rice
    + Tid1-1 exhibit right helical growth of the leaves and stem and shortening of the roots
    + These data indicate that SRS5 independently regulates cell elongation of the brassinosteroid signal transduction pathway
    + In this study, we report a novel semi-dominant mutant Small and round seed 5 (Srs5) that encodes alpha-tubulin protein
    + Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2
    + Lemma cell length was reduced in Srs5 compared with that of the wild-type
    + Cells in the leaves of Tid1-1 are often ill-shapen, possibly owing to irregular cell division
