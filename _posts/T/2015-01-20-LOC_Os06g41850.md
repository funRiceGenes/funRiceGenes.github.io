* **Key message**  
    + Our findings suggest that TGW6 may be useful for further improvements in yield characteristics in most cultivars
    + Loss of function of the IAA-glucose hydrolase gene TGW6 enhances rice grain weight and increases yield
    + In sink organs, the Nipponbare tgw6 allele affects the timing of the transition from the syncytial to the cellular phase by controlling IAA supply and limiting cell number and grain length
    + Here, we report the cloning and functional analysis of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 (TGW6), a gene from the Indian landrace rice Kasalath
    + TGW6 encodes a novel protein with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-glucose hydrolase activity
    + Phylogenetic and expression analyses of grain weight genes TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 and investigation of substrate availability indicate TGW6 does not regulate auxin content of grains but may affect pollen development
    + This evidence, combined with our observation that developing wheat grains have undetectable levels of ester IAA in comparison to free IAA and do not express an IAA-glucose synthase suggests that TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 do not regulate grain size via the hydrolysis of IAA-glucose
    + However, a critical comparison of data on TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 with other reports on IAA synthesis in cereal grains requires that this hypothesis be reinvestigated
    + The 1-bp deletion allele of tgw6 cloned from the Indian landrace rice cultivar Kasalath, which has lost function, enhances both grain size and yield
    + TGW6 has been utilized as a target for breeding and genome editing to increase the yield of rice
