* **Key message**  
    + The alteration of leaf color in tcd11 mutants was aligned with chlorophyll (Chl) content and chloroplast development
    + The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature
    + In addition, the disruption of TCD11 greatly reduced the transcript levels of certain chloroplasts-associated genes and prevented the assembly of ribosome in chloroplasts at low temperature (20 °C), whereas they recovered to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32 °C)
    + Thus, our data indicate that TCD11 plays an important role in chloroplast development at low temperature
    + The map-based cloning and molecular complementation showed that TCD11 encodes the ribosomal small subunit protein S6 in chloroplasts (RPS6)
