* **Key message**  
    + A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous
    + Based on sequence comparison and molecular analysis, we propose that the chloroplast-located TPI may be encoded by divergent structural nuclear genes in rice
