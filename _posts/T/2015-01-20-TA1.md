* **Information**  
    + Symbol: TA1  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os05g43440](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g43440)  
    + RAPdb: [Os05g0509700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0509700)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Defective mitochondrial function by mutation in THICK ALEURONE 1 encoding a mitochondrion-targeted single-stranded DNA-binding protein leads to increased aleurone cell layers and improved nutrition in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Defective mitochondrial function by mutation in THICK ALEURONE 1 encoding a mitochondrion-targeted single-stranded DNA-binding protein leads to increased aleurone cell layers and improved nutrition in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2021, Mol Plant.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Cytological analyses revealed that the increased aleurone cell layers in ta1 originate from a developmental switch of subaleurone toward aleurone instead of starchy endosperm in the wild type
