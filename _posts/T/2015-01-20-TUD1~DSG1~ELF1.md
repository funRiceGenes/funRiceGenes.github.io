* **Key message**  
    + The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice
    + In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase
    + Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tud1 is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs
    + Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment
    + In the dsg1 mutant (an allelic mutant of tud1), the lengths of the roots, internodes, panicles, and seeds were shorter than that in the wild-type, which was due to defects in cell division and elongation
    + These results demonstrate that DSG1 positively regulates cell division and elongation and may be involved in multiple hormone pathways
    + The dsg1 mutant is less sensitive to brassinosteroid treatment than the wild-type, and DSG1 expression is negatively regulated by brassinosteroids, ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid
    + These results indicate that less than half of ELF1-regulated genes in rice seedlings are affected by OsBRI1, and suggest that ELF1 acts in a rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway different from that initiated by OsBRI1
    + These results imply that ELF1 suppresses stress-induced signalling, and that jasmonic acid signaling is stimulated in elf1-1; therefore, ELF1 may be involved in the brassinosteroid-mediated suppression of jasmonic acid response in rice
    + Physiological analyses suggested that elf1-1 is brassinosteroid-insensitive, so we hypothesized that ELF1 encodes a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling
    + Similarities in the phenotypes of elf1 and d61 mutants (mutants of brassinosteroid receptor gene OsBRI1), and in the regulation of ELF1 and OsBRI1 expression, imply that ELF1 functions as a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling in rice
    + U-box proteins have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases; in fact, ELF1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro
    + Here, by conducting yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro ubiquitination experiments, we demonstrate that ELF1 interacts with the OsWRKY4 transcription factor, a positive regulator of defense responses to rice sheath blight
    + These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses
    + ELF1 decreased the stability of OsWRKY4, whereas exogenous jasmonic acid treatment suppressed this effect of ELF1, resulting in OsWRKY4 accumulation in rice plants
    + We conclude that ELF1 participates in the antagonistic interaction between these two phytohormones by suppressing the jasmonic acid response through the down-regulation of OsWRKY4 protein level in rice
    + In addition, inhibition of BR synthesis promotes GSK2 accumulation and suppresses TUD1 stability
    + Furthermore, the GSK2 degradation process is largely impaired in tud1 in response to BR
    + In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of TUD1 in BR-induced GSK2 degradation, thereby advancing our understanding of a critical step in the BR signaling pathway of rice
    + The U-box ubiquitin ligase TUD1 promotes brassinosteroid-induced GSK2 degradation in rice.
    + Here, we identify the U-box ubiquitin ligase TUD1 as a GSK2-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening
