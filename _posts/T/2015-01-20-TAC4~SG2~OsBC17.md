* **Key message**  
    + TAC4 can regulate rice shoot gravitropism by increasing the indole acetic acid content and affecting the auxin distribution
    + TAC4 controls tiller angle by regulating the endogenous auxin content and distribution in rice
    + The loss of TAC4 function leads to a significant increase in the tiller angle
    + A sequence analysis revealed that TAC4 has undergone a bottleneck and become fixed in indica cultivars during domestication and improvement
    + TAC4 encodes a plant-specific, highly conserved nuclear protein
    + We further found that BRs enhance the accumulation of SG2 in the nucleus, and subcellular distribution of SG2 is regulated by GSK2 kinase activity
    + The decreased grain size was caused by repressed cell expansion in spikelet hulls of the sg2 mutant
    + In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with SG2 and plays an antagonistic role with SG2 in controlling gene expression and grain size
    + Our results indicated that SG2 is a new component of GSK2-related BR signaling response and regulates grain size by interacting with OsOFP19
    + SG2 is a positive regulator downstream of GSK2 in response to BR signaling, and its mutation causes insensitivity to exogenous BR treatment
    + According to LC-MS/MS analysis of intermediate products of the lignin synthesis pathway, the accumulation of caffeyl alcohol in the osbc17 mutant was significantly higher than in Pingtangheinuo
    + Caffeyl alcohol can be polymerized to the catechyl lignin monomer by laccase ChLAC8; however, ChLAC8 and OsBC17 are not homologous proteins, which suggests that the osbc17 gene is involved in this process by regulating laccase expression
