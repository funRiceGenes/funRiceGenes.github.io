* **Information**  
    + Symbol: TL  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: [Os12g0124900](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os12g0124900)  

* **Publication**  
    + [A novel antisense long noncoding RNA, TWISTED LEAF, maintains leaf blade flattening by regulating its associated sense R2R3-MYB gene in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel antisense long noncoding RNA, TWISTED LEAF, maintains leaf blade flattening by regulating its associated sense R2R3-MYB gene in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, New Phytol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Downregulation of TL by RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression of OsMYB60 resulted in twisted leaf blades in transgenic rice
    + This suggests that TL may play a cis-regulatory role on OsMYB60 in leaf morphological development
