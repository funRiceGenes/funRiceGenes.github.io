    + Isolation of TSCD11 Gene for Early Chloroplast Development under High Temperature in Rice
    + The TSCD11 gene encodes a seryl-tRNA synthetase localized to chloroplast
    + Compared with the wild type (WT), mutation in TSCD11 led to significant alteration in expression levels of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development under high temperature
    + The tscd11 mutant developed albino leaves at the 3-leaf stage under high temperature (35 °„C), but had normal green leaves under low temperature (25 °„C)
    + Consistent with the albino phenotype, impaired chloroplasts, decreased chlorophyll content and increased ROS accumulation were found in the tscd11 mutant at 35 °„C
