* **Key message**  
    + Natural variation in the promoter of TGW2 determines grain width and weight in rice.
    + <U+2022> A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation at 1818<U+00A0>bp upstream of TGW2 is responsible for its different expression, leading to alteration in grain width and weight by influencing cell proliferation and expansion in glumes
    + TGW2 interacts with KRP1, a regulator of cell cycle in plant, to negatively regulate grain width and weight
    + Genetic diversity analysis of TGW2 in 141 rice accessions revealed it as a breeding target in a selective sweep region
    + The sequence variation and candidate grain shape-related gene TGW2 were identified through Fst and sweep selective analysis
