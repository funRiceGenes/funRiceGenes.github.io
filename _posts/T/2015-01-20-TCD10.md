* **Key message**  
    + The disruption of TCD10 resulted in an evidently reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes under cold stress (20C), whereas they did recovered to normal levels at high temperature (32C)
    + The TCD10 encodes a novel rice PPR protein, mainly located in chloroplasts, which is important for chloroplast development, growth and the maintenance of photosynthetic electron transport and its disorder would lead to an aberrant chloroplast and abnormal expressions in these genes for chloroplast development and photosynthesis in rice under cold stress
    + The Rice Pentatricopeptide Repeat Gene TCD10 is Needed for Chloroplast Development under Cold Stress.
    + In this paper, we characterized a new rice PPR gene mutant tcd10 (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 10) that exhibits the albino phenotype, malformed chloroplast and could not survive after the 5-leaf stage when grown at 20C, but does the normal phenotype at 32C
    + These results showed an important role of TCD10 for chloroplast development under cold stress
    + Map-based cloning, followed by RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques, revealed that TCD10 encoding a novel PPR protein, mainly localized to the chloroplasts, with 27 PPR motifs, is responsible for the mutant phenotype
