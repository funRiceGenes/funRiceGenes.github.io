    + Development of Commercial Thermo-sensitive Genic Male Sterile Rice Accelerates Hybrid Rice Breeding Using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TMS5 Editing System.
    + RESULTS: Here, thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) was induced by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to modify the gene TMS5
    + Generation of a new thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice line by targeted mutagenesis of TMS5 gene through CRISPR/Cas9 system.
    + In the present study, a super grain quality line, GXU 47, was used to generate a new TGMS line with specific mutations in a major TGMS gene tms5 generated with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in order to improve the rice quality of two-line hybrids
    + CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Mutagenesis of TMS5 Confers Thermosensitive Genic Male Sterility by Influencing Protein Expression in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + The present study results prove that it is feasible and efficient to generate an excellent mutant line with CRISPR/Cas9, which provides a novel molecular mechanism of male sterility caused by the mutation of tms5
