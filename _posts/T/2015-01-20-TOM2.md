## Information
__Symbol__: TOM2  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os11g04030](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g04030)  
__RAPdb__: [Os11g0135000](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os11g0135000)  

## Publication
1. [The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, J Biol Chem.

## Genbank accession number
[AK121911](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK121911)

## Expression information
__Expression__: Strong TOM2 expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, while TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation |  Transgenic rice in which TOM2 expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared to non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
