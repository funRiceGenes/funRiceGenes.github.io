* **Key message**  
    + In onion epidermal and rice root cells, the TOM2-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, indicating that the TOM2 protein is a transporter for phytosiderophore efflux to the cell exterior
    + Transgenic rice in which TOM2 expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared to non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice
    + Our results indicate that TOM2 is involved in the internal transport of DMA, which is required for normal plant growth
    + Strong TOM2 expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, while TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation
    + The phytosiderophore efflux transporter TOM2 is involved in metal transport in rice.
    + In the present study, we analyzed TOM2 and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil
