* **Key message**  
    + TAC4 can regulate rice shoot gravitropism by increasing the indole acetic acid content and affecting the auxin distribution
    + TAC4 controls tiller angle by regulating the endogenous auxin content and distribution in rice
    + The loss of TAC4 function leads to a significant increase in the tiller angle
    + A sequence analysis revealed that TAC4 has undergone a bottleneck and become fixed in indica cultivars during domestication and improvement
    + TAC4 encodes a plant-specific, highly conserved nuclear protein
