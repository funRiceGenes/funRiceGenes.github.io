* **Key message**  
    + Our findings suggest that TGW6 may be useful for further improvements in yield characteristics in most cultivars
    + Loss of function of the IAA-glucose hydrolase gene TGW6 enhances rice grain weight and increases yield
    + In sink organs, the Nipponbare tgw6 allele affects the timing of the transition from the syncytial to the cellular phase by controlling IAA supply and limiting cell number and grain length
    + Here, we report the cloning and functional analysis of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 (TGW6), a gene from the Indian landrace rice Kasalath
    + TGW6 encodes a novel protein with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-glucose hydrolase activity
