* **Key message**  
    + Consistent with its thermosensitive phenotype, TAP expression is induced by high temperature
    + TAP directly promotes the expression of OsYABBY3 (OsYAB3), OsYAB4, and OsYAB5, which encode key transcriptional regulators in panicle and spikelet development
    + In addition, TAP physically interacts with OsYAB4 and OsYAB5 proteins; phenotypic analysis of osyab4 tap-1 and osyab5 tap-1 double mutants indicates that TAP-OsYAB4/OsYAB5 complexes act to maintain normal panicle and spikelet development
    + The tap mutants display high temperature-dependent reproductive abnormalities, including compromised secondary branch and spikelet initiation and pleiotropic floral organ defects
    + We isolated a Poaceae-specific FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS3 (FHY3)/FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1)family transcription factor, Thermo-sensitive Spikelet Defects 1 (TSD1), derived from transposase in rice (Oryza sativa) TSD1 was highly expressed in spikelets, induced by heat, and specifically enhanced the thermotolerance of spikelet morphogenesis
    + Disrupting TSD1 did not affect vegetative growth but markedly retarded spikelet initiation and development, as well as caused varying degrees of spikelet degeneration, depending on the temperature
    + Most tsd1 spikelets were normal at low temperature but gradually degenerated as temperature increased, and all disappeared at high temperature, leading to naked branches
    + Notably, the knockout mutant yab5-ko and double mutant tsd1 yab5-ko resembled tsd1 in spikelet appearance and response to temperature, indicating that these genes likely participate in spikelet development through the cooperative TSD1-YABBY module
    + These YABBY proteins can form either homodimers or heterodimers and play an important role in spikelet morphogenesis, similar to TSD1
