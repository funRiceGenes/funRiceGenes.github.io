## Key message
1. __jasmonate__, [Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate MeJA treatment in the root
2. __root__, [Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate MeJA treatment in the root
