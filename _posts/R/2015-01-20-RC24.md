## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
2. __stem__, [Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
3. __growth__, [Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  RC24 protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited chitinase activity and strongly inhibited bacterial growth
4. __leaf__, [Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
5. __leaf__, [Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  RC24 transcript accumulation was also observed in intact leaf tissues upon wounding, Transgenic rice plants containing the RC24/GUS gene fusion further confirmed that the RC24 gene showed a tissue-specific expression pattern and that transcription of the RC24 propmoter was sensitively and rapidly activated by wounding
