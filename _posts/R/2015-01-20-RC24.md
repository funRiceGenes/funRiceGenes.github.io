* **Key message**  
    + A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
    + RC24 protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited chitinase activity and strongly inhibited bacterial growth
    + RC24 transcript accumulation was also observed in intact leaf tissues upon wounding, Transgenic rice plants containing the RC24/GUS gene fusion further confirmed that the RC24 gene showed a tissue-specific expression pattern and that transcription of the RC24 propmoter was sensitively and rapidly activated by wounding
