* **Key message**  
    + These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
    + Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
    + DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.
    + Here, we report genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in wild-type and ros1a mutant sperm and vegetative cells
    + We find that the rice vegetative cell genome is locally hypomethylated compared with sperm by a process that requires ROS1a activity
    + We show that many ROS1a target sequences in the vegetative cell are hypomethylated in the rice central cell, suggesting that ROS1a also demethylates the central cell genome
