## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny%5BTitle%5D),  These T0 plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
2. __vegetative__, [A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny%5BTitle%5D),  These T0 plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
3. __dormancy__, [A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny%5BTitle%5D),  Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
4. __seed__, [A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny%5BTitle%5D),  Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
5. __pollen__, [A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny%5BTitle%5D),  These T0 plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
6. __endosperm__, [A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny%5BTitle%5D),  Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
