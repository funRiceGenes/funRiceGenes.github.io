* **Key message**  
    + By transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we found that RA1 protein was localized in the chloroplast
    + RNA analysis revealed biogenesis of chloroplast rRNAs was abnormal in ra1
    + These results suggest that RA1 is involved in early chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice
    + Expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthesis and plastid development related genes were disordered in the ra1 mutant
    + Map-based cloning revealed that RA1 gene encodes a glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), which was confirmed by genetic complementation and knockout by Crispr/Cas9 technology
