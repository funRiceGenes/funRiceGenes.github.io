## Expression information

## Key message
1. __pollen__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsPBP1 is a single copy gene and preferentially expressed in pistil and pollen but down-regulated by pollination
2. __pollen__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility
3. __pollen__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsPBP1 protein was localized in a region peripheral to pollen wall and vesicles of elongating pollen tube, and its repressed expression reduced substantially this association and led to alteration of microfilament polymerization during pollen germination
4. __pollen__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, these results indicate that OsPBP1 is a novel functional C2-domain phospholipids-binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca2+ and phospholipid signaling pathways
5. __pollen__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D), A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice
6. __grain__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility
7. __fertility__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility
8. __fertility__, [A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, OsPBP1, is required for pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, these results indicate that OsPBP1 is a novel functional C2-domain phospholipids-binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca2+ and phospholipid signaling pathways
