* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease
    + RF2a, which stimulates Box II-dependent transcription in a homologous in vitro transcription system, accumulates in nuclei of phloem and certain other cell types in shoots, but is found at only very low levels in roots
    + Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration
    + RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease
    + When a fusion gene comprising the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and RF2a cDNA was coexpressed with the GUS reporter genes, GUS activity was increased by 2-20-fold
    + Transcription factor RF2a alters expression of the rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter in transgenic tobacco plants
    + Rice transcription factor RF2a binds to the BoxII cis element of the promoter of rice tungro bacilliform virus and activates promoter expression
    + Functional analysis of the activation domain of RF2a, a rice transcription factor
    + Transgenic antisense plants in which RF2a accumulation was suppressed had normal roots but stunted, twisted leaves with small, disorganized vascular bundles, an enlarged sclerenchyma and large air spaces
    + Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development
    + We also demonstrate a physical interaction between OsTBP2 and RF2a, a rice bZIP transcription factor that bound to the box II cis element of the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus, resulting in enhanced transcription from the viral promoter
    + We conclude that OsTBP2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal transcription factor OsTFIIB and the accessory transcription factor RF2a
    + Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System
    + RF2a is a bZIP transcription factor that regulates expression of the promoter of rice tungro bacilliform badnavirus
    + Functional analysis of RF2a, a rice transcription factor
