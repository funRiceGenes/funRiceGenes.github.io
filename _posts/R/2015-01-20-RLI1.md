* **Key message**  
    + The rli1 mutants showed reduced leaf inclination and the RLI1 over-expressors showed increased leaf inclination
    + RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
    + Therefore, SPX and RLI1 form a module to regulate leaf inclination in response to external Pi availability in rice
