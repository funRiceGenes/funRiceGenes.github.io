* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype
    + OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
    + We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY
    + To better understand genetic control of root hair formation in rice, we analyzed root hairless 1 (rth1) mutant that was induced by NaN3 treatment
    + SEM observation showed that in rth1 plants, root hair elongation was abolished after the formation of bulge
