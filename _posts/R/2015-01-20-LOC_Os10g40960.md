* **Key message**  
    + RL14 was transcribed in sclerenchymatous cells in leaves that remained wrapped inside the sheath
    + Expression of genes related to secondary cell wall formation was affected in rl14-1 mutants, and cellulose and lignin content were altered in rl14-1 leaves
    + In addition, rl14 mutant plants displayed smaller stomatal complexes and decreased transpiration rates, as compared with the wild type
    + These results reveal that the RL14 gene affects water transport in leaves by affecting the composition of the secondary cell wall

* **Connection**  
    + __RL14__, __SRL2~AVB~NRL2~NRL3__, [NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 2 regulates leaf shape, male fertility, and seed size in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 2 regulates leaf shape, male fertility, and seed size in rice.%5BTitle%5D), The NRL2 protein interacted with Rolling-leaf (RL14), causing the leaves of the nrl2 mutants to have a higher cellulose content and lower lignin content than the WT, which may have been related to sclerenchymatous cell differentiation and tapetum degeneration
