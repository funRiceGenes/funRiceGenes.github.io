## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
2. __gibberellin__, [Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA)
3. __seed__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
4. __seed__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice
5. __seed__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells
6. __seed__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Histochemical studies also indicate that the OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer the hormonal regulation of GUS expression in germinating seeds
7. __growth__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
8. __vegetative__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice
9. __vegetative__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells
10. __seed__, [Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds%5BTitle%5D)), In germinating rice seeds, a cysteine proteinase (REP-1), synthesized in aleurone-layer cells, is a key enzyme in the degradation of the major storage protein, glutelin
11. __nitrogen__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells
12. __nitrogen__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer nitrogen regulation of GUS expression in suspension-cultured cells
