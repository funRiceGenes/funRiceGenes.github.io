* **Key message**  
    + We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices
    + Transcripts of cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, and R2 were detected uniformly in the dividing region of the root apex
    + When R2 was overexpressed in a CAK-deficient mutant of budding yeast, it suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the mutation
    + Increasing R2 abundance through a transgenic approach accelerated S-phase progression and overall growth rate in suspension cells
    + In planta, the CTD kinase activity of R2 was induced by a growth-promoting signal
