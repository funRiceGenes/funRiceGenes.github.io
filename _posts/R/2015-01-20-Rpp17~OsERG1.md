## Expression information

## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization also showed that Rpp17 was more strongly expressed in vascular tissues of tiller buds
2. __plant defense signaling__, [Rice C2-domain proteins are induced and translocated to the plasma membrane in response to a fungal elicitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice C2-domain proteins are induced and translocated to the plasma membrane in response to a fungal elicitor%5BTitle%5D), These results suggest that OsERG1 proteins containing a single C2-domain are involved in plant defense signaling systems.

2. __Rpp16~OsPBP1__, __Rpp17~OsERG1__, [Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues%5BTitle%5D),  Conservation of five exon sizes as well as splicing positions between the two genes suggest that either RPP16 or RPP17 is a resultant of gene duplication
3. __Rpp16~OsPBP1__, __Rpp17~OsERG1__, [Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues%5BTitle%5D),  By protein blot analysis, RPP16 and RPP17 proteins were specifically detected in soluble and insoluble fractions of a crude extract of rice plants, respectively, suggesting that these proteins play different roles in individual cells
4. __Rpp16~OsPBP1__, __Rpp17~OsERG1__, [Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of Rpp16 and Rpp17 was monitored by the β-glucuronidase gusA reporter-gene method
5. __Rpp16~OsPBP1__, __Rpp17~OsERG1__, [Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues%5BTitle%5D),  Rpp16-gusA and Rpp17-gusA were expressed preferentially in the phloem tissues from different parts of the plant, but almost no GUS staining was observed in the rest of the tissues
6. __Rpp16~OsPBP1__, __Rpp17~OsERG1__, [Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues%5BTitle%5D), Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues
