* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptome analysis showed that RBP-L knockdown greatly affected the expression of prolamine family genes and several classes of transcription factors
    + Moreover, distinct from RBP-P, RBP-L exhibits additional regulatory roles in development, either directly through its binding to corresponding RNAs or indirectly through its effect on transcription factors
    + Reduced amounts of RBP-L caused partial mislocalization of glutelin and prolamine RNAs and conferred other general growth defects, including dwarfism, late flowering, and smaller seeds

    + __RBP-L__, __RBP-P__, [Targeted Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Storage Protein mRNAs Requires the RNA-Binding Protein RBP-L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Targeted Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Storage Protein mRNAs Requires the RNA-Binding Protein RBP-L.%5BTitle%5D),  Collectively, these results indicate that RBP-L, like RBP-P, is a key RBP involved in mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells
