    + Symbol: RPR1  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os11g12340](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g12340)

    + [Chemical induction of disease resistance in rice is correlated with the expression of a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Chemical induction of disease resistance in rice is correlated with the expression of a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats%5BTitle%5D), 1999, Plant Mol Biol.

    + [AB019186](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB019186)

* **Key message**  
    + RPR1 contains a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats, thus sharing structural similarity with known disease resistance genes
    + While the role of RPR1 has yet to be clarified, this is the first report of the identification of a member of this gene class and its induction during the systemic expression of induced disease resistance
