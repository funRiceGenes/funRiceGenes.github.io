## Expression information

## Key message
1. __phytohormone__, [Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones
2. __shoot__, [Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones
