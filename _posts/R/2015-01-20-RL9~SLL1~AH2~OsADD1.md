* **Key message**  
    + RL9 is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers
    + The SLL1 gene was expressed at the lateral root tip, whereas SLL1 expression was not detected in the elongation zone of the crown roots
    + These results indicate that the lateral root specific defect in sll1 mutant is caused by the different expression patterns of SLL1 in lateral and crown roots
    + In this study, we characterized two rice (Oryza sativa) allelic rolled-leaf mutants, rolled leaf 9-1 (rl9-1) and rl9-2, which display very similar phenotypes with completely adaxialized leaves and malformed spikelets
    + Here, we show the isolation and functional characterization of SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1), a key gene controlling rice leaf rolling
    + SLL1 is transcribed in various tissues and accumulates in the abaxial epidermis throughout leaf development
    + Our findings identify the role of SLL1 in the modulation of leaf abaxial cell development and in sustaining abaxial characteristics during leaf development
    + An sll1 mutant has decreased lateral root growth due to a defect in the cell elongation
    + SLL1 encodes a SHAQKYF class MYB family transcription factor belonging to the KANADI family
    + We have identified a gene, SHORT LATERAL ROOT LENGTH1 (SLL1), which is important for the elongation of lateral roots in rice
    + In addition, SLL1 over-expressers produced significantly longer lateral roots compared to the wild-type, and thus SLL1 gene would be very useful for improving rice root architecture
    + SLL1, which encodes a member of the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase family, is involved in cell elongation in lateral roots via regulation of fatty acid content in rice
    + SLL1 deficiency leads to defective programmed cell death of abaxial mesophyll cells and suppresses the development of abaxial features
    + We measured the fatty acid content and found that the 18:0 content in the sll1 mutant root was approximately 4 times that in the wild-type root
    + The transient expression of a RL9-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that RL9 protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that RL9 acts as a putative transcription factor
    + Additionally, SLL1 deficiency results in increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis
    + AH2 encodes a MYB domain protein that determines hull fate and affects grain yield and quality in rice.
    + In the study, AH2 encodes a MYB domain protein, and functions in the development of hull and grain
    + Mutation of AH2 produces smaller grains and alters grain quality including decreased amylose content and gel consistency, and increased protein content
    + Our results revealed that AH2 plays an important role in the determination of hull epidermis development, palea identity, and grain size
    + Meantime, part of the hull lost the outer silicified cells, and induces a transformation of the outer rough epidermis to inner smooth epidermis cells, and the body of the palea was reduced in the ah2 muant
