## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3%5BTitle%5D)), Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
2. __starch__, [Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3%5BTitle%5D)), Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
3. __endosperm__, [Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3%5BTitle%5D)), Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
4. __grain__, [Complete Structures of Three Rice Sucrose Synthase Isogenes and Differential Regulation of Their Expressions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Complete Structures of Three Rice Sucrose Synthase Isogenes and Differential Regulation of Their Expressions%5BTitle%5D)),  It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3
5. __grain__, [An expression analysis profile for the entire sucrose synthase gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An expression analysis profile for the entire sucrose synthase gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  SUS3 and SUS4 were predominantly expressed in the caryopsis, indicating potential roles in carbon allocation within the filling grain
