* **Key message**  
    + Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
    + It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3
    + SUS3 and SUS4 were predominantly expressed in the caryopsis, indicating potential roles in carbon allocation within the filling grain
