## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice

## Connection
