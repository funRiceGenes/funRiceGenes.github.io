* **Key message**  
    + In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded
    + This study demonstrates that Rdd1 is a circadian clock and phy-regulated gene, which is associated with grain size in rice
    + Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice
    + We report here on the characterization of a putative Dof transcription factor gene in rice (Oryza sativa)--rice Dof daily fluctuations 1 (Rdd1)
    + Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity
    + Our results suggest that RDD1 can contribute to the increased grain productivity of rice via inducing the efficient uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions
    + MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.
    + Here, we show that the transcription factor encoding gene RDD1 plays a role in improving the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions in rice
