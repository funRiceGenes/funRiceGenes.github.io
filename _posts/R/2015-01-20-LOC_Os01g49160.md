* **Key message**  
    + RGN1 controls grain number and shapes panicle architecture in rice
    + We demonstrated that RGN1 controls lateral grain formation by regulation of LONELY GUY (LOG) expression, thus controlling grain number and shaping panicle architecture
    + Identification of RGN1 provides a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of lateral grain formation in rice, RGN1 will be an important gene resource for molecular breeding for higher yield
