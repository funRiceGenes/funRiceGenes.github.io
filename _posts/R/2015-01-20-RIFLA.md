    + [Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED RIFLA, regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED RIFLA, regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, Plant Sci.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Together, these results suggest that the floral repressor activity of OsMADS56 is epigenetically regulated by RIFLA and OsiEZ1
    + Overexpression of RIFLA in rice repressed OsMADS56 expression but activated the expression of flowering inducers Hd3a and RFT1
