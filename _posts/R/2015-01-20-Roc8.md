* **Key message**  
    + HD-ZIP IV gene Roc8 regulates the size of bulliform cells and lignin content in rice
    + Unexpectedly, Roc8 was also observed to positively mediate lignin biosynthesis without incurring a production penalty
    + The above results show that Roc8 may have a practical application in cultivating materials with high photosynthetic efficiency and low lignin content
    + Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice

    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we demonstrated the transcription activation activity of both ROC8 and ROC5
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ROC8 and ROC5 each could form homodimer, but ROC8 interacted preferably with ROC5 to forms a heterodimer
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Importantly, we showed that the ROC8-ROC5 heterodimer rather than the homodimer of ROC8 or ROC5 was functional as neither overexpressing ROC8 in the ROC5 mutant nor overexpressing ROC5 in the ROC8-knockout line could rescue the mutant phenotype
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  This was further partially supported by the identification of a large number of common differentially expressed genes in single and double mutants of roc8 and roc5
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ROC8 and ROC5 were functionally additive as the phenotype of abaxially rolled leaves was stronger in the roc5roc8 double mutant than in their single mutants
