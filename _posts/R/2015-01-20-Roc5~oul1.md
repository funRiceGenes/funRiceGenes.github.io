* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, overexpression of Roc5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling
    + Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice
    + To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf1 (oul1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling
    + Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice
    + Many genes, including homeodomain leucine zipper IV transcription factors ROC5 and ROC8, regulating rice leaf rolling have been cloned and functionally analysed

    + __PFL__, __Roc5~oul1__, [Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1
    + __PFL__, __Roc5~oul1__, [Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice%5BTitle%5D), The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5-overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function

    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ROC8 and ROC5 each could form homodimer, but ROC8 interacted preferably with ROC5 to forms a heterodimer
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Importantly, we showed that the ROC8-ROC5 heterodimer rather than the homodimer of ROC8 or ROC5 was functional as neither overexpressing ROC8 in the ROC5 mutant nor overexpressing ROC5 in the ROC8-knockout line could rescue the mutant phenotype
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  This was further partially supported by the identification of a large number of common differentially expressed genes in single and double mutants of roc8 and roc5
    + __Roc5~oul1__, __Roc8__, [Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ROC8 and ROC5 were functionally additive as the phenotype of abaxially rolled leaves was stronger in the roc5roc8 double mutant than in their single mutants
