* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic expression of RBG1 also increases auxin accumulation and sensitivity, which facilitates root development, particularly crown roots
    + Taken together, we have discovered that RBG1 regulates two distinct and important traits in rice, namely grain yield and stress tolerance, via its effects on cell division, auxin and stress protein induction
    + Ectopic expression of RBG1 regulated by a specific constitutive promoter, GOS2, enhanced harvest index and grain yield in rice
    + Moreover, overexpression of RBG1 upregulated a large number of heat shock proteins, leading to enhanced tolerance to heat, osmotic and salt stresses, as well as rapid recovery from water-deficit stress
    + Ectopic expression of RBG1 promotes cell division, and RBG1 co-localizes with microtubules known to be involved in cell division, which may account for the increase in organ size
