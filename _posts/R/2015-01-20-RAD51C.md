* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells
    + The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells
    + Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C-KO line restored fertility
    + The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
    + Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
    + Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice

    + __RAD51C__, __XRCC3__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D), Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
    + __MOF__, __RAD51C__, [MEIOTIC F-BOX Is Essential for Male Meiotic DNA Double Strand Break Repair in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=MEIOTIC F-BOX Is Essential for Male Meiotic DNA Double Strand Break Repair in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), The recruitment of Completion of meiosis I (COM1) and Radiation sensitive51C (RAD51C) to DSBs is severely compromised in mutant meiocytes, indicating that MOF is crucial for DSB end-processing and repair
