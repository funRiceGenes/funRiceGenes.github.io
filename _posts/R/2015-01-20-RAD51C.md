## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells
2. __meiosis__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)), The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells
3. __fertility__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C-KO line restored fertility
4. __reproductive__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells
5. __anther__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
6. __mitosis__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
7. __pollen__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
8. __meiotic__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
9. __vegetative__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
10. __sterility__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice
11. __sterility__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)

## Connection
1. __RAD51C__, __XRCC3__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
