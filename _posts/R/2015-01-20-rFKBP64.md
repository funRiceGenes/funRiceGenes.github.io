## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of rFKBP64 at RNA level was elevated by heat stress in roots and shoots and low in mature leaves
2. __shoot__, [The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of rFKBP64 at RNA level was elevated by heat stress in roots and shoots and low in mature leaves

## Connection
