* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of the 16-kDa α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor RAG2 improves grain yield and quality in rice.
    + Overexpression of RAG2 significantly increased grain size and improved grain quality and yield simultaneously
    + These results imply that RAG2 might play an important role in regulating grain weight and seed quality in rice
    + The functional characterization of rice RAG2 facilitates a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in grain size and seed quality, and may be helpful for improving grain yield and quantity in cereal crops
    + RAG2 is a member of 14-16 kDa α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors in rice, which belong to the albumin of seed storage proteins
    + We found that RAG2 was specifically expressed in ripening seed and its transcription peak was between 14 and 21 days after flowering
