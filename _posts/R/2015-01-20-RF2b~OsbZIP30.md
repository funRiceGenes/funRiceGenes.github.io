* **Key message**  
    + Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration
    + Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease
    + Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of RF2b exhibit a disease-like phenotype
    + RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease
    + Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development
