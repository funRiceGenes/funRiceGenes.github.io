## Connection
1. __RF2a~OsbZIP75__, __RF2b~OsbZIP30__, [RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease%5BTitle%5D)),  RF2b, identified by its interaction with RF2a, binds to Box II in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF2a/RF2b heterodimers
2. __RF2a~OsbZIP75__, __RF2b~OsbZIP30__, [RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease%5BTitle%5D)),  Like RF2a, RF2b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants
3. __RF2a~OsbZIP75__, __RF2b~OsbZIP30__, [RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease%5BTitle%5D)),  Both RF2a and RF2b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues
4. __RF2a~OsbZIP75__, __RF2b~OsbZIP30__, [RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease%5BTitle%5D)),  However, RF2a and RF2b have different DNA-binding affinities to Box II, show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization
5. __RF2a~OsbZIP75__, __RF2b~OsbZIP30__, [RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that the regulation of phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter and potentially the control of RTBV replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the Box II cis element with multiple host factors, including RF2a and RF2b
6. __RF2a~OsbZIP75__, __RF2b~OsbZIP30__, [RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease%5BTitle%5D)), RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease
