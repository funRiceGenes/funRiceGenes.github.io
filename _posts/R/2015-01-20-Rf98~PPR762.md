* **Key message**  
    + Here, we identified seven pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) genes that are located within a 170 kb region as candidates for Rf98 Complementation tests revealed that the introduction of one of these PPR genes, PPR762, resulted in the partial recovery of fertility with a seed setting rate up to 9
    + The low rate of seed setting suggested that some other genes near the Rf98 locus are also necessary for the full recovery of seed setting
    + Fine mapping of Rf98 revealed that at least two genes, which are closely positioned, are required for complete fertility restoration in RT98A
