## Key message
1. __BR signaling__, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis
2. __homeostasis__, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis
3. __homeostasis__, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways
4. __ BR __, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor
