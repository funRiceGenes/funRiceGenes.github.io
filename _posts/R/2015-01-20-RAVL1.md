* **Key message**  
    + Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis
    + Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis
    + This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways
    + This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor
    + Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
    + Moreover, (15)NH4(+) uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels
    + RAVL1 activates brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling to modulate response to sheath blight disease in rice.
    + Mutants d61-1 and d2 were less susceptible to sheath blight disease, bri1-D was more susceptible, and ravl1 and d61-1/EIL1 Ri5 were similarly susceptible compared to WT
    + Mutants ers1 and d61-1/RAVL1 OX were resistant to sheath blight disease, whereas EIL1 RNAi mutants and RAVL1 OX were more susceptible than WT
    + Our analyses provide information on how BR and ethylene signaling regulate sheath blight disease and on the regulatory function of RAVL1 in rice sheath blight disease
    + Transcriptome analysis, ChIP, EMSA, and transient assays indicted that RAVL1 might directly activate Ethylene insensitive 3-like 1 (EIL1), a master regulator of ethylene signaling
    + BRI1 and D2 expression in EIL1 Ri5/RAVL1 OX and EIL1 expression in d61-1/RAVL1 OX, indicated that RAVL1 activates BRI1/D2 and EIL1, respectively, independent of BR and ethylene signaling
