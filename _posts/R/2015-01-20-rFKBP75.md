## Expression information

## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness%5BTitle%5D),  The only FKBP to be expressed in seeds was the rFKBP75 which was higher in the embryos and endosperm of dry seeds then in the same organs separated from imbibed seeds, indicating that the protein is important in the steps of seed maturation
2. __seed__, [The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins FKBPs demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness%5BTitle%5D),  The only FKBP to be expressed in seeds was the rFKBP75 which was higher in the embryos and endosperm of dry seeds then in the same organs separated from imbibed seeds, indicating that the protein is important in the steps of seed maturation
