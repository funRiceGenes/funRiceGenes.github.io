* **Key message**  
    + One mutant, designated rim1-1, did not show typical disease symptoms upon infection with RDV
    + These results suggest that RIM1 may represent a new molecular link in jasmonate signaling, and may thereby provide new insights into the well-established coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) JA signaling pathway
    + The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling
    + Here, we report that RIM1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of JA signaling and is degraded in response to JA treatment via a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway
    + The expression profiles of the mutants were significantly correlated with those of JA-treated wild-type plants without accumulation of endogenous JA, indicating that RIM1 functions as a component of JA signaling
    + The expression of genes encoding JA biosynthetic enzymes (lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase 2 (AOS2) and OPDA reductase 7 (OPR7)) was up-regulated in the rim1 mutants under normal conditions, and a rapid and massive accumulation of endogenous JA was detected in the mutants after wounding
    + We recently identified the NAC transcription factor RIM1 as a host factor involved in multiplication of rice dwarf virus (RDV)
    + Plants carrying rim1 mutations show a phenotype of root growth inhibition
    + The rim1-1 mutant remained susceptible to the two other viruses tested, one of which is also transmitted by leafhoppers, suggesting that the multiplication rather than transmission of RDV is specifically impaired in this mutant
    + Multilayered regulation of membrane-bound ONAC054 is essential for abscisic acid-induced leaf senescence in rice.
    + Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) NAM/ATAF<U+00BD>/CUC2 (NAC) transcription factor ONAC054 plays an important role in ABA-induced leaf senescence
    + onac054 knockout mutants maintained green leaves, while ONAC054-overexpressing lines showed early leaf yellowing under dark- and ABA-induced senescence conditions
    + The significance of this multilayered regulation of ONAC054 for ABA-induced leaf senescence is also discussed
    + Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including ABA INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) and senescence-associated genes, including STAY-GREEN and NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1), were significantly downregulated in onac054 mutants
