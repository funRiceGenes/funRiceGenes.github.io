* **Publication**  
    + [Defective mitochondrial function by mutation in THICK ALEURONE 1 encoding a mitochondrion-targeted single-stranded DNA-binding protein leads to increased aleurone cell layers and improved nutrition in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Defective mitochondrial function by mutation in THICK ALEURONE 1 encoding a mitochondrion-targeted single-stranded DNA-binding protein leads to increased aleurone cell layers and improved nutrition in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2021, Mol Plant.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We found that TA1/OsmtSSB1 interacts with mitochondrial DNA recombinase RECA3 and DNA helicase TWINKLE, and downregulation of RECA3 or TWINKLE also leads to ta1-like phenotypes

* **Connection**
