* **Key message**  
    + The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
    + Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice (Oryza sativa) is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1), which regulates palea identity and development
    + The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
    + Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry
    + The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild-type lemma
    + DP1 is an AT-hook protein while REP1 is a TCP transcription factor, both of which are important regulators of palea development
    + Functional analyses suggest that the OsTb2 protein positively regulates tillering by interacting with the homologous OsTb1 protein and counteracts the inhibitory effect of OsTb1 on tillering
    + Here, we report that an OsTb1 duplicate gene (OsTb2) has been artificially selected during upland rice adaptation and that natural variation in OsTb2 is associated with tiller number
