## Publication
1. [RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2012, Mol Plant.

## Expression information

## Key message
1. __brassinosteroid__, [RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene
2. __phytohormone__, [RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that RPL1 regulated phenotypic plasticity likely through its involvement in epigenetic processes affecting responses of the plant to phytohormones
