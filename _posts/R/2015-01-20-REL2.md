* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as rel2
    + The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc
    + REL2 is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice
    + We firstly mapped REL2 to a 35-kb physical region of chromosome 10 by map-based cloning strategy
    + Further studies showed that REL2 protein is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane of cells and the REL2 gene is relatively higher expressed in younger leaves of rice
