* **Key message**  
    + Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)(+) RNA from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with jasmonic acid (JA) for 1/2h yielded a cDNA of a gene tentatively named RERJ1 that is upregulated in response to exogenous JA
    + Northern blot analysis indicated that the RERJ1 mRNA levels peaked at 1/2-1h after the addition of jasmonic acid and then decreased gradually
    + RERJ1, a jasmonic acid-responsive gene from rice, encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein
    + " We previously reported that RERJ1, a JA-inducible transcription factor in rice, is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress
    + RERJ1 expression was induced only at the region of injury after wounding, whereas expression was induced in the entire leaf after drought
    + According to JA measurements of stressed leaves, high accumulation of endogenous JA was only detected around the wound site in a rice leaves, whereas the drought treatment led to uniform accumulation of JA in the entire leaf, suggesting that RERJ1 will be a useful marker gene for studies on localization of JA in rice"
    + Stress-induced expression of the transcription factor RERJ1 is tightly regulated in response to jasmonic acid accumulation in rice
    + We previously reported that RERJ1, a JA-inducible transcription factor in rice, is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress
    + The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene RERJ1 isolated from suspension-cultured rice cells encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif
    + The phenotypes of transgenic rice plants overexpressing sense or antisense RERJ1 mRNA demonstrated that RERJ1 is involved in the growth inhibition of rice shoots caused by JA
    + It is also suggested that JA but not abscisic acid is involved in the up-regulation of RERJ1 expression caused by wounding and drought stress
    + According to JA measurements of stressed leaves, high accumulation of endogenous JA was only detected around the wound site in a rice leaves, whereas the drought treatment led to uniform accumulation of JA in the entire leaf, suggesting that RERJ1 will be a useful marker gene for studies on localization of JA in rice
    + These results suggest that RERJ1 plays a role as a transcriptional activator for regulating stress-inducible gene expression, with a strong correlation to JA accumulation in the stressed region
    + " In this study, we found that RERJ1 is also expressed in rice plants in response to JA, and that its expression in rice leaves is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress
