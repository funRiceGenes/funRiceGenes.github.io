    + Disruption of a Upf1-like helicase-encoding gene OsPLS2 triggers light-dependent premature leaf senescence in rice.
    + Disruption of OsPLS2 accelerated light-dependent leaf senescence in the rice mutant of ospls2
    + This mutation prompts aberrant splicing of OsPLS2 messenger and consequent disruption of its full-length protein translation, suggesting a negative role of OsPLS2 in regulating leaf senescence
    + When continuously exposed to far-red light, exogenous H2O2 and/or abscisic acid (ABA), the ospls2 mutant sustained hypersensitive leaf senescence
    + In consistence, light and ROS signal pathways in ospls2 were activated by down-regulation of phytochrome genes, and up-regulation of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) and WRKY genes, all promoting leaf senescence
    + Together, these data indicated that OsPLS2 played an essential role in leaf senescence and its disruption triggered light-dependent leaf senescence in rice
    + Shading and light filtration studies showed that the ospls2 phenotype, which was characteristic of photo-oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, was an effect of irritation by light
    + The OsPLS2 locus was isolated and cloned by map-based cloning that encodes a Upf1-like helicase
    + Through map-based cloning, a G-to-A substitution was determined at the 1st nucleotide of the 13th intron in the OsPLS2 gene that encodes a Upf1-like helicase
