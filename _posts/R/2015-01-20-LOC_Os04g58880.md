* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + RLS2 was widely expressed and spatially restricted in vascular bundles
    + In brief, our study revealed that RLS2 is required for normal vascular bundle differentiation and primary nutrient assimilation
    + Map-based cloning has revealed that RLS2 encodes OsEXO70A1, which is one of the 47 members of EXO70s in rice
