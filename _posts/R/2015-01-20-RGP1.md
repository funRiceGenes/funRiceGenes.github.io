* **Key message**  
    + During seedling growth, rgp1 expression was first observed 14 days after germination, reaching a maximum level between 28 and 42 days, and gradually decreased thereafter until 63 days when it attained the same level of expression as in 14-day-old seedlings
    + Corn (Zea mays) contains a biochemically similar and structurally homologous RGP1, which has been thought (it now seems mistakenly) to function in starch synthesis
    + Expression of rgp1 was found to be markedly reduced throughout the growth period of both 5-azacytidine-induced dwarf plants and their progenies, relative to levels in untreated tall control plants
    + These results suggest that expression of rgp1 may be influenced, either directly or indirectly, by DNA methylation, and that the rgp1 protein may play an important role in plant growth and development
    + Along with other evidence, this suggests that RGP1 is involved in synthesis of xyloglucan and possibly other hemicelluloses
