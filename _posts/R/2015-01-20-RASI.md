* **Key message**  
    + The recombinant inhibitor had strong inhibitory activity toward subtilisin, with an equimolar relationship, comparable with that of native RASI, and weak inhibitory activity toward some microbial alpha-amylases, but not toward animal or insect alpha-amylases
    + RASI was found to be expressed only in seeds, suggesting that it has a seed-specific function
    + These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms
