## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  RMS encodes a mitochondrial protein, 178 aa in length, of unknown function, unlike the majority of other Rf genes cloned thus far, which encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins
2. __fertility__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Through positional cloning, we identified a nuclear candidate gene, RETROGRADE-REGULATED MALE STERILITY (RMS) for Rf17, a fertility restorer gene for Chinese wild rice (CW)-type CMS in rice (Oryza sativa L
3. __fertility__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of RMS restored fertility to a CMS plant, whereas its overexpression in the fertility restorer line induced pollen abortion
4. __fertility__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that a reduced-expression allele of the RMS gene restored fertility in haploid pollen, whereas a normal-expression allele caused pollen to die in the CW-type CMS
5. __pollen__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of RMS restored fertility to a CMS plant, whereas its overexpression in the fertility restorer line induced pollen abortion
6. __pollen__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that a reduced-expression allele of the RMS gene restored fertility in haploid pollen, whereas a normal-expression allele caused pollen to die in the CW-type CMS
7. __anther__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The mRNA expression level of RMS in mature anthers depended on cytoplasmic genotype, suggesting that RMS is a candidate gene to be regulated via retrograde signaling
8. __fertility__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Through positional cloning, we identified a nuclear candidate gene, RETROGRADE-REGULATED MALE STERILITY (RMS) for Rf17, a fertility restorer gene for Chinese wild rice (CW)-type CMS in rice (Oryza sativa L
9. __sterility__, [Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Through positional cloning, we identified a nuclear candidate gene, RETROGRADE-REGULATED MALE STERILITY (RMS) for Rf17, a fertility restorer gene for Chinese wild rice (CW)-type CMS in rice (Oryza sativa L
