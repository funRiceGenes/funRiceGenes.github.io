* **Key message**  
    + Identification of RAE3 sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development and provides an example of how selection on different genes can confer the same domestication phenotype in Asian and African rice
    + A 48-bp deletion may disrupt the substrate recognition domain in RAE3 and diminish awn elongation
