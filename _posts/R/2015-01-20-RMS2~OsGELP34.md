* **Key message**  
    + RMS2 was map-based cloned as an endoplasmic reticulum-localized GDSL lipase gene, which is predominantly transcribed during early anther development
    + RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.
    + Furthermore, RMS2 is directly targeted by male fertility regulators Undeveloped Tapetum 1 (UDT1) and Persistent Tapetal Cell 1 (PTC1) both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RMS2 may serve as a key node in the rice male fertility regulatory network
    + GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.
    + OsGELP34 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein and was mainly expressed in anthers during pollen exine formation
    + osgelp34 mutant displayed abnormal exine and altered expression of a number of key genes required for pollen development
    + These results suggested that OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 catalyze different compounds for pollen exine development
    + OsGELP34 is distant from OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 in sequence, and osgelp34 and osgelp110/osgelp115 mutants were different in anther morphology despite both were male sterile
    + OsGELP34 was identified by cloning of a male sterile mutant gene
