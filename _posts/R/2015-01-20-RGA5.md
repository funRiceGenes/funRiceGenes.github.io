* **Key message**  
    + Two NB-LRR protein-coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39
    + The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding
    + The rice NLR RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pia through direct interaction
    + We relied for this on detailed knowledge on the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-PikD, AVR-Pia, and AVR1-CO39 by, respectively, the rice NLRs Pikp-1 and RGA5
    + The rice nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain immune receptors (NLRs) RGA4 and RGA5 form a helper NLR/sensor NLR (hNLR/sNLR) pair that specifically recognizes the effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 from the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae
    + By analysing structure-informed point mutations in the RGA5(HMA) -binding surface in protein interaction studies and in Nicotiana benthamiana cell death assays, we found that HMA self-interaction does not contribute to RGA5 function
