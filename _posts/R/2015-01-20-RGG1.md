* **Key message**  
    + Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.
    + The present study provides evidence of a unique function of RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice without affecting yield
    + The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200<U+00A0>mM NaCl
