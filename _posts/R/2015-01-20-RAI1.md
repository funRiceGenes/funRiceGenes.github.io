* **Key message**  
    + RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
    + In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1
    + The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus
    + These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice

    + __OsMKK4~LARGE11__, __RAI1__, [The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity%5BTitle%5D), Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade
    + __OsMPK1~OsMAPK6~OsSIPK__, __RAI1__, [The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity%5BTitle%5D), RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro
