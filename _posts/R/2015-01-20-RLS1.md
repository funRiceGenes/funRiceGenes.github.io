## Key message
1. __cytokinin__, [A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin
2. __leaf__, [A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice rls1 (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified
3. __leaf__, [A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The rapid loss of chlorophyll content during senescence was the main cause of accelerated leaf senescence in rls1
4. __leaf__, [A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin

6. __leaf__, [A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice
7. __senescence__, [A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice rls1 (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified
