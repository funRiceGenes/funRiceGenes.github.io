* **Key message**  
    + Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin
    + In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice rls1 (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified
    + The rapid loss of chlorophyll content during senescence was the main cause of accelerated leaf senescence in rls1
    + Intriguingly, constitutive expression of RLS1 also slightly accelerated leaf senescence with decreased chlorophyll content in transgenic rice plants
    + A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice
    + The rls1 mutant developed small, yellow-brown lesions resembling disease scattered over the whole surfaces of leaves that displayed earlier senescence than those of wild-type plants
    + Microscopic observation indicated that PCD was misregulated, probably resulting in the accelerated degradation of chloroplasts in rls1 leaves
