## Expression information

## Key message
1. __sterile__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The RA8 promoter may be useful for controlling gene expression in anthers of cereal plants and for generating male-sterile plants
2. __anther__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), An anther-specific cDNA clone of rice, RA8, was isolated from an anther cDNA library by differential screening
3. __anther__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA blot analysis indicated that the RA8 transcript is present specifically in anthers and the transcript level increased as flowers matured, reaching the highest level in mature flowers
4. __anther__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the RA8 promoter was active in the tapetum, endothecium, and connective tissues of anthers
5. __anther__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The RA8 promoter may be useful for controlling gene expression in anthers of cereal plants and for generating male-sterile plants

7. __tapetum__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the RA8 promoter was active in the tapetum, endothecium, and connective tissues of anthers
8. __flower__, [Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA blot analysis indicated that the RA8 transcript is present specifically in anthers and the transcript level increased as flowers matured, reaching the highest level in mature flowers
