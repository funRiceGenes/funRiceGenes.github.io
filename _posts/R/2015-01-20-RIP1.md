## Expression information

## Key message
1. __pollen__, [Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated a pollen-preferential gene, RICE IMMATURE POLLEN 1 (RIP1), from a T-DNA insertional population of japonica rice that was trapped by a promoterless beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene
2. __pollen__, [Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that the RIP1 transcript was abundant at the late stages of pollen development
3. __pollen__, [Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Microscopic analysis demonstrated that development in the rip1 pollen was delayed, starting at the early vacuolated stage
4. __pollen__, [Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that RIP1 is necessary for pollen maturation and germination
5. __pollen__, [Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, RIP1 is probably a nuclear protein that may form a functional complex with other proteins and carry out essential cellular and developmental roles during the late stage of pollen formation
6. __pollen__, [Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development%5BTitle%5D)), Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development
