* **Key message**  
    + The fertility restorer gene, Rf2, for Lead Rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility of rice encodes a mitochondrial glycine-rich protein
    + In Lead Rice-type CMS, discovered in the indica variety 'Lead Rice', fertility of the CMS plant is restored by the single nuclear-encoded gene Rf2 in a gametophytic manner
    + As Rf2 does not encode a pentatricopeptide repeat protein, unlike a majority of previously identified Rf genes, the data from this study provide new insights into the mechanism for restoring fertility in CMS
    + Expression of Rf2 mRNA was detected in developing and mature anthers
    + An RF2-GFP fusion was shown to be targeted to mitochondria

* **Connection**  
    + __Rf2__, __RIF2__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D), coli-produced recombinant GST-tagged RF2 and His-tagged RIF2 confirmed that RF2 interacted with RIF2
    + __Rf2__, __RIF2__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D), These results suggest that RIF2 is a candidate factor of a fertility restoration complex of RF2
