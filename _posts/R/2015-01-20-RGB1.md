    + The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1
    + The number of sterile seeds also increased in both RGB1 knock-down lines
    + Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions
    + Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5
    + Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.
    + In contrast, mRNA levels of RGB1 (rice Gβ subunit) were significantly upregulated by ABA treatment and the lack of RGB1 led to reduced drought tolerance
    + Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions
    + Taken together, it is proposed that RGB1 is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by RGB1 and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses
    + The dynamic anatomical characteristics of the embryos of the rgb1 seedlings and WT during early postgermination and according to TUNEL assays showed that the suppressed growth of the rgb1 mutants was caused by cell death
    + In addition to the limited shoot and root development, the development of the embryo shoot-root axis was suppressed in the rgb1 mutants
    + RGB1 was expressed mainly in the root epidermal and vascular tissues of the embryo
    + The heterotrimeric G protein β subunit RGB1 plays an important role in plant growth and development
    + However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of rice growth by RGB1 remain elusive
    + The heterotrimeric G protein β subunit RGB1 is required for seedling formation in rice.
    + Here, the rgb1 mutants rgb1-1 (+ 1 bp), rgb1-2 (- 1 bp), and rgb1-3 (- 11 bp) were isolated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and they were arrested at 1 day after germination and ultimately exhibited seedling lethality
    + Moreover, transcript profiling analysis revealed that the expression of a large number of auxin-, cytokinin-, and brassinosteroid-inducible genes was upregulated or downregulated in the rgb1 mutant compared to the wild type during seedling development
    + Overall, the rgb1 mutants provide an ideal material for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying rice seedling formation during early postgermination development by G proteins
    + The heterotrimeric G protein β subunit RGB1 acts as a crucial factor in promoting early postgermination seedling development in rice
