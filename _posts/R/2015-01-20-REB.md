## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter%5BTitle%5D)), The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice
2. __endosperm__, [Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter%5BTitle%5D)), The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice
3. __endosperm__, [Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter%5BTitle%5D)),  The function of the Reb gene was explored by a transient assay by using a rice immature endosperm system
4. __endosperm__, [Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter%5BTitle%5D)),  We isolated a novel bZIP protein (REB) gene encoding 425 amino acid residues from rice endosperm, which is similar to Opaque-2 heterodimerizing protein (OHP) of maize
5. __endosperm__, [Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter%5BTitle%5D)),  A Super-shift assay using anti-REB antibody suggested that REB is a major DNA-binding protein for the alpha-globulin gene promoter in rice endosperm
