* **Key message**  
    + The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice
    + The function of the Reb gene was explored by a transient assay by using a rice immature endosperm system
    + We isolated a novel bZIP protein (REB) gene encoding 425 amino acid residues from rice endosperm, which is similar to Opaque-2 heterodimerizing protein (OHP) of maize
    + A Super-shift assay using anti-REB antibody suggested that REB is a major DNA-binding protein for the alpha-globulin gene promoter in rice endosperm
