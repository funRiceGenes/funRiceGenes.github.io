* **Publication**  
    + [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Rice (N Y).

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AK065246](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK065246)

* **Key message**  
    + A study of subcellular localization demonstrated that only RIF2 was targeted to mitochondria
    + These results suggest that RIF2 is a candidate factor of a fertility restoration complex of RF2
    + RIF2 encodes ubiquitin domain-containing protein
