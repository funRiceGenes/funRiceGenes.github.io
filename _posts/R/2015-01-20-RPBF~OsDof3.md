* **Key message**  
    + These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling
    + Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice
    + The Dof (DNA binding with one finger) transcriptional activator rice (Oryza sativa) prolamin box binding factor (RPBF), which is involved in gene regulation of rice seed storage proteins, has been isolated from rice cDNA expressed sequence tag clones containing the conserved Dof
    + We demonstrated by transient expression in rice callus protoplasts that the isolated RPBF trans-activated several storage protein genes via an AAAG target sequence located within their promoters, and with methylation interference experiments the additional AAAG-like sequences in promoters of genes expressed in maturing seeds were recognized by the RPBF protein
    + The RPBF gene is predominantly expressed in maturing endosperm and coordinately expressed with seed storage protein genes, and is involved in the quantitative regulation of genes expressed in the endosperm in cooperation with RISBZ1
    + Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes
    + Overexpression of both transcription factors gave rise to much higher levels of expression than the sum of individual activities elicited by either RPBF or RISBZ1 alone
    + The results showed the accessory function of OsDOF3 responsible for a dosage-dependent mediation of GA signaling that leads to high-level expression of physiological target genes
    + ) basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo
    + To ascertain the functions of these trans-activators in seed development, knock-down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm-specific manner by co-suppression (KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RPBF)
    + Storage lipids were accumulated at reduced levels in KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds
    + KD-RPBF and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds exhibited multi-layered aleurone cells
    + The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice
    + Through genome-wide expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SERF1 directly regulates RICE PROLAMIN-BOX BINDING FACTOR (RPBF), a TF that functions as a positive regulator of grain filling
    + Our study reveals that SERF1 represents a negative regulator of grain filling and seedling establishment by timing the expression of RPBF
    + Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF
    + Loss of SERF1 enhances RPBF expression resulting in larger grains with increased starch content, while SERF1 overexpression represses RPBF resulting in smaller grains
    + This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively
    + Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain
