31. __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Synergism between RPBF and RISBZ1 recognizing the GCN4 motif [TGA(G/C)TCA] was observed in the expression of many storage protein genes
32. __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of both transcription factors gave rise to much higher levels of expression than the sum of individual activities elicited by either RPBF or RISBZ1 alone
33. __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, mutation of recognition sites suppressed reciprocal trans-activation ability, indicating that there are mutual interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF
34. __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes%5BTitle%5D)),  The RPBF gene is predominantly expressed in maturing endosperm and coordinately expressed with seed storage protein genes, and is involved in the quantitative regulation of genes expressed in the endosperm in cooperation with RISBZ1
35. __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes%5BTitle%5D)), Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes
