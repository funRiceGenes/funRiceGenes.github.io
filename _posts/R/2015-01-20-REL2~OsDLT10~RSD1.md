* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as rel2
    + The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc
    + REL2 is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice
    + We firstly mapped REL2 to a 35-kb physical region of chromosome 10 by map-based cloning strategy
    + Further studies showed that REL2 protein is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane of cells and the REL2 gene is relatively higher expressed in younger leaves of rice
    + Here, we report a semi-dwarf and low tillering mutant Osdlt10 (dwarf and low tillering 10) that exhibited reduced tiller number, semi-dwarfism, increased grain width, low seed-setting rate, curled leaf tip and a series of abnormalities of agronomic traits
    + Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsDLT10 was primarily expressed in the stem node, the basic part of axillary bud and leaf sheath, pulvinus
    + Phenotypic observations showed that Osdlt10 mutants had defects in tiller bud formation and grew slowly at the tillering stage
    + Endogenous auxin content decreased significantly at the base of stem node and axillary bud in Osdlt10 mutants
    + The hormone treatment investigation indicated that extremely high of exogenous auxin concentrations can inhibit the expression of OsDLT10
    + The results showed that OsDLT10 was related to auxin
    + These results revealed that OsDLT10 played a critical role in influencing tiller number, likely in association with hormone signals and the WUS-CLV pathway, to regulate axillary bud development in rice
    + This study characterized the functions of RSD1 and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development
    + OsSDD1 and RSD1 are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata
    + By dehydration stress assay, the decreased stomatal density of rsd1 mutants enhanced their dehydration avoidance
    + RSD1 Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice
    + It was found that the deletion of RSD1 would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of stomatal density and distribution 1 (OsSDD1)
    + Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to rsd1 mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata
