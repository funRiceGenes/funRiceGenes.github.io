3. __flower__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions
4. __flower__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Although RFT1 RNAi plants flowered normally, double RFT1-Hd3a RNAi plants did not flower up to 300 days after sowing (DAS), indicating that Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice
5. __flower__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RFT1 expression was very low in wild-type plants, but there was a marked increase in RFT1 expression by 70 DAS in Hd3a RNAi plants, which flowered 90 DAS
6. __flower__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice

11. __flower__, [Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)),  Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice

27. __floral__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that Hd3a and RFT1 act as floral activators under SD conditions, and that RFT1 expression is partly regulated by chromatin modification
28. __flower__, [The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This suggests that the divergent functions of paralogs RFT1 and Hd3a, and of MADS50 and MADS51, are in part due to differential H3K36me2/3 deposition, which also correlates with higher expression levels of MADS50 and RFT1 in flowering promotion in rice

71. __Ehd1__, __RFT1__, [Genetic interactions between diverged alleles of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Heading date 3a (Hd3a)/ RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1) control differential heading and contribute to regional adaptation in rice (Oryza sativa).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic interactions between diverged alleles of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Heading date 3a (Hd3a)/ RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1) control differential heading and contribute to regional adaptation in rice (Oryza sativa).%5BTitle%5D)), Genetic interactions between diverged alleles of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Heading date 3a (Hd3a)/ RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1) control differential heading and contribute to regional adaptation in rice (Oryza sativa).
