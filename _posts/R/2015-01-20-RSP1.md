## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a cDNA and a Gene for Subtilisin-like Serine Proteases from Rice Oryza sativaL. andArabidopsis thaliana](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a cDNA and a Gene for Subtilisin-like Serine Proteases from Rice Oryza sativaL. andArabidopsis thaliana%5BTitle%5D),  The RSP1 was found to be expressed in seed and shoots of seedlings while ASP48 transcripts was found to be accumulated in immature silique and flowers, indicating that both RSP1 and ASP48 are organ-specific and may be involved in the specific proteolytic events that occur during organ development
2. __flower__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a cDNA and a Gene for Subtilisin-like Serine Proteases from Rice Oryza sativaL. andArabidopsis thaliana](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a cDNA and a Gene for Subtilisin-like Serine Proteases from Rice Oryza sativaL. andArabidopsis thaliana%5BTitle%5D),  The RSP1 was found to be expressed in seed and shoots of seedlings while ASP48 transcripts was found to be accumulated in immature silique and flowers, indicating that both RSP1 and ASP48 are organ-specific and may be involved in the specific proteolytic events that occur during organ development
