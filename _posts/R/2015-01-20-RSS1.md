* **Key message**  
    + No correlation between sucrose synthase activity and starch biosynthesis was seen in these mutants, although slight elevations of RSs1 transcript levels were observed
    + We previously showed that the rice protein RSS1, whose stability is regulated depending on the cell cycle phases, is a key factor for the maintenance of meristematic activity under stressful conditions
    + Molecular characterization of the rice protein RSS1 required for meristematic activity under stressful conditions
    + RSs1 was expressed predominantly in the endosperm of milky stage rice seeds with maximum expression at 3~5 days after pollination which were 8~10-fold over leaf levels
    + Cloning and expression of rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose synthase 1 (RSs1) in developing seed endosperm
    + Here we show that RSS1 interacts with all the PP1 expressed in the shoot apex of rice
    + These effects of RSS1 are exerted by regulating the G1-S transition, possibly through an interaction of RSS1 with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin
    + ) sucrose synthase 1 (RSs1) was used to determine spatial expression of the gene in rice tissues and temporal expression in developing rice endosperm
    + Here we show that a rice protein, RSS1, whose stability is controlled by cell cycle phases, contributes to the vigour of meristematic cells and viability under salinity conditions
    + RSS1 regulates the cell cycle and maintains meristematic activity under stress conditions in rice
    + " Here we show that a rice protein, RSS1, whose stability is controlled by cell cycle phases, contributes to the vigour of meristematic cells and viability under salinity conditions"
    + " Interestingly, the recombinant RSS1 protein is highly resistant to heat with respect to its anti-coagulability and binding activity to PP1"
    + RSs1 transcript and activity levels were analyzed in two starch deficient mutants of rice to determine if the lesion in these mutants resides at the locus for RSs1
