* **Key message**  
    + Transcriptional activation of NRKe or 9RKe resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants
    + CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RKe locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature
    + The LRR domain of RKe protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature
    + The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap
