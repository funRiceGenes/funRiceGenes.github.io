## Key message
1. __temperature__, [A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature%5BTitle%5D), " Transcriptional activation of NRKe or 9RKe resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants
2. __temperature__, [A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature%5BTitle%5D),  CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RKe locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature

5. __disease__, [A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature%5BTitle%5D),  The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap

## Connection
1. __RKe__, __Xa26~Xa3__, [A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of NRKe and the kinase domain of Xa3/Xa26 developed the same lesion mimics as the NRKe-transgenic plants, whereas transgenic plants carrying another chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of Xa3/Xa26 and the kinase domain of NRKe were free of lesion mimic
