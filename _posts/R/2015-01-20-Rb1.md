* **Key message**  
    + Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.
    + However, overexpression of Rb1 and Rb2 sharply decreased grain filling
    + Map-based cloning and transformation assays further divided PSH1 as two tightly linked bHLH genes, Rb1 and Rb2
