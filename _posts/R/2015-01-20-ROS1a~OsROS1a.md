* **Key message**  
    + These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
    + Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
    + DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.
    + Here, we report genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in wild-type and ros1a mutant sperm and vegetative cells
    + We find that the rice vegetative cell genome is locally hypomethylated compared with sperm by a process that requires ROS1a activity
    + We show that many ROS1a target sequences in the vegetative cell are hypomethylated in the rice central cell, suggesting that ROS1a also demethylates the central cell genome
    + Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT
    + The osros1a mutants had shrink spikelets, smaller anthers and pollen grains, and were not stained by iodine staining showing a significant reduction in total soluble sugar and starch contents as compared to wildtype (WT), which caused complete male sterility
    + Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + Combined with previous studies, our findings suggested that the RRMF domain in OsROS1a is the functional domain and loss of RRMF for OsROS1a causes sterility in rice

    + __OsPKS2__, __ROS1a~OsROS1a__, [Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing showed that the CG and CHG methylation of the OsPKS2 gene promoter was significantly increased in the osros1a mutant, which caused a reduced expression of OsPKS2 in osros1a mutants
    + __ROS1a~OsROS1a__, __TDR__, [Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  DNA methylation of the TDR gene promoter was similar between WT and osros1a mutants, indicating that the DNA methylation effect by OsROS1a was gene specific
