* **Key message**  
    + The rice mitochondrial genome has a sequence homologous to the gene for ribosomal protein S14 (rps14), but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop codons
    + The nuclear rps14 gene encodes a long N-terminal extension showing significant similarity to a part of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) protein from human and a malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum)
    + Considering that the rice mitochondrial genome lacks the sdhB gene but contains the rps14-related sequence, transfer of the sdhB gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the rps14 gene
    + The migration of the mitochondrial rps14 sequence into the already existing sdhB gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and mitochondrial targeting
    + A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins
    + Taken together, OsSDH2-1 plays a crucial role in leaf senescence and yield formation in rice
    + OsSDH2-1 gene was expressed in all organs tested, with higher expression in leaves, root tips, ovary and anthers
    + OsSDH2-1 protein was targeted to mitochondria
