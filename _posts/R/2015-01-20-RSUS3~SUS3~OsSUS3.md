* **Key message**  
    + Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
    + It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3
    + SUS3 and SUS4 were predominantly expressed in the caryopsis, indicating potential roles in carbon allocation within the filling grain
    + In addition, we transformed the 'Habataki' Sus3 gene into 'Nipponbare', and the transformants obtained high-temperature tolerance
    + Therefore, we conclude that the causal gene underlying the QTL Apq1 is the thermo-responsive Sus3 allele, and the increase in Sus3 expression under high-temperature condition during ripening leads to high-temperature tolerance in rice
    + Among these, the temporal expression pattern of sucrose synthase 3 (Sus3) corresponded well with the high temperature-sensitive period during ripening, and expression of the 'Habataki' allele of Sus3 was increased under high-temperature condition
    + Distinct cellulose and callose accumulation for enhanced bioethanol production and biotic stress resistance in OsSUS3 transgenic rice.
