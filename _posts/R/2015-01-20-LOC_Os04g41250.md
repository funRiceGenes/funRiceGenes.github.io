* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, the basal expression levels of QSH1 and SHAT1 genes (transcription factors that regulate seed-pod shattering in rice) were significantly lower in these plants than in wild-type plants; however, nitrosative stress negatively regulated the expression of QSH1 and SHAT1 in both WT and rhs1 plants, but positively regulated QSH4 expression in rhs1 plants alone
    + The absence of RHS1, which encodes a putative armadillo/beta-catenin repeat family protein, resulted in high sensitivity of the rhs1 plants to nitrosative stress
    + The expression of CPL1 (a negative regulator of seed shattering in rice) was significantly lower in rhs1 plants, and we found that CPL1 expression was correlated with S-nitrosothiol (SNO) alteration in rhs1
    + Interestingly noe1, a rice mutant with high SNO levels, exhibited low seed shattering, whereas rhs1 resulted in low SNO levels with high seed shattering
    + A Novel RHS1 Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols.
    + The knockout mutant line rhs1 exhibited a significantly high shattering of grains in comparison to the wild-type plants
    + Therefore, RHS1 is a novel gene that negatively regulates the shattering trait in rice via regulation of endogenous SNO levels
