## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins%5BTitle%5D), The rice mitochondrial genome has a sequence homologous to the gene for ribosomal protein S14 rps14), but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop codons
2. __mitochondria__, [A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins%5BTitle%5D),  The nuclear rps14 gene encodes a long N-terminal extension showing significant similarity to a part of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit B SDHB protein from human and a malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum)  
3. __mitochondria__, [A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins%5BTitle%5D),  Considering that the rice mitochondrial genome lacks the sdhB gene but contains the rps14-related sequence, transfer of the sdhB gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the rps14 gene
4. __mitochondria__, [A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins%5BTitle%5D),  The migration of the mitochondrial rps14 sequence into the already existing sdhB gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and mitochondrial targeting
5. __mitochondria__, [A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins%5BTitle%5D), A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins
