* **Publication**  
    + [A fertility restorer gene, Rf4, widely used for hybrid rice breeding encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A fertility restorer gene, Rf4, widely used for hybrid rice breeding encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Rice (N Y).

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We revealed that Rf4 encoded a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein and reduced the orf352-containing transcripts, thereby restoring pollen fertility
    + Through a map-based cloning, we have independently identified an allele of a recently reported Rf4 gene and demonstrated that the fertility restoration is controlled sporophytically
