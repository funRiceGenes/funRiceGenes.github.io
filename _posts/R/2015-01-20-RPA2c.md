* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified RPA2c, a rice gene preferentially expressed during meiosis
    + RPA2c colocalized with the meiotic cohesion subunit REC8 and the axis-associated protein PAIR2
    + Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice
