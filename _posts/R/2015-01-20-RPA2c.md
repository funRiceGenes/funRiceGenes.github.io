## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identified RPA2c, a rice gene preferentially expressed during meiosis
2. __meiotic__, [Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RPA2c colocalized with the meiotic cohesion subunit REC8 and the axis-associated protein PAIR2
3. __meiotic__, [Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice

## Connection
1. __RPA1c__, __RPA2c__, [Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, we identified RPA1c, an RPA1 subunit with nearly overlapping distribution to RPA2c, required for ~79% of chiasmata formation
2. __RPA1c__, __RPA2c__, [Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice
