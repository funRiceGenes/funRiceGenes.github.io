* **Key message**  
    + A series of experiments, including the transcription factor-centered technology, DNA-binding assay, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, verified that RLM1 can bind to the promoter of OsCAD2, a key gene responsible for lignin biosynthesis in rice
    + In particular, RLM1 is exclusively expressed in the stems at the mature plant stage
    + The yield of RLM1 knockdown lines increased by over 11% without other adverse agricultural trait penalties, indicating great practical application value
    + Cytological observations revealed that the rlm1 was mainly caused by abnormal deposition of secondary cell walls
