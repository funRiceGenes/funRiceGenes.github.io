* **Key message**  
    + We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 (fc1) mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog
    + Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 (10 microM) causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on fc1 mutants, implying that proper FC1 functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth
    + Overexpression of FC1 partially rescued d3-2 defects in the tiller growth and plant height
    + An in situ hybridization analysis showed that FC1 mRNA accumulates in axillary buds, the shoot apical meristem, young leaves, vascular tissues and the tips of crown roots
    + We propose that FC1 acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice
    + To understand the molecular mechanisms that control culm mechanical strength, we identified a flexible culm1 (fc1) mutant by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
    + In this study, we cloned the FLEXIBLE CULM1 (FC1) gene in rice using a T-DNA tagging approach
    + Our results indicated that FC1 plays an important role in the biosynthesis of lignin and the control of culm strength in rice
    + On the other hand, the expression level of FC1 is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment
    + FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
    + FC1 encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase and is mainly expressed in the sclerenchyma cells of the secondary cell wall and vascular bundle region
    + In these types of cells, a deficiency of FC1 in the fc1 mutant caused a reduction in cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in lignin
    + Further histological and biochemical analyses revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl and guaiacyl monomers in fc1 cell wall were reduced greatly
    + Extracts from the first internodes and panicles of the fc1 plants exhibited drastically reduced cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase activity
