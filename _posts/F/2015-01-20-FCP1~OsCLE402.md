* **Key message**  
    + Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
    + Constitutive expression of FCP1 results in consumption of the SAM in the vegetative phase, and application of an FCP1 CLE peptide in vitro disturbs root development by misspecification of cell fates in the RAM
    + Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM
    + In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase
    + Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice
    + WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice
    + Here, we examined the role of FCP1 in leaf development
    + We found that overexpression of FCP1 affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath
    + Taken together, our results suggest that FCP1 is involved in the regulation of cell fate determination during leaf development
    + Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by FCP1 overexpression
