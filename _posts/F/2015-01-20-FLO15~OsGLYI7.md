* **Key message**  
    + The flo15 grains were characterized by defects in compound starch granule development, along with decreased starch content
    + Moreover, the expression of starch synthesis-related genes was obviously altered in the flo15 mutants
    + These findings suggest that FLO15 plays an important role in compound starch granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm
    + Map-based cloning of the flo15 mutants identified mutations in OsGLYI7, which encodes a glyoxalase I (GLYI) involved in methylglyoxal (MG) detoxification
