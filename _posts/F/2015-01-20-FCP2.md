## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here it is shown that exogenous application of a synthetic dodeca-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of the rice FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN2 (FCP2p) protein or overexpression of FCP2 terminates root apical meristem (RAM) activity and impairs late metaxylem formation
2. __root__, [A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, a cross-species peptide treatment experiment in Arabidopsis implies that FCP2 has both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific roles in root development
3. __vegetative__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase
4. __root development__, [A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, a cross-species peptide treatment experiment in Arabidopsis implies that FCP2 has both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific roles in root development
5. __shoot__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
6. __root apical meristem__, [A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here it is shown that exogenous application of a synthetic dodeca-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of the rice FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN2 (FCP2p) protein or overexpression of FCP2 terminates root apical meristem (RAM) activity and impairs late metaxylem formation

10. __shoot apical meristem__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
