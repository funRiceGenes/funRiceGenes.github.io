* **Key message**  
    + A nucleus-localized PPR protein OsNPPR1 is important for mitochondrial function and endosperm development in rice.
    + Thus, OsNPPR1 was involved in regulation of mitochondrial development and/or functions that are important for endosperm development
    + This gene encodes a nucleus-localized PPR protein we named it OsNPPR1 that affected mitochondrial function
