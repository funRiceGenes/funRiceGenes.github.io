## Key message
1. __homeostasis__, [Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray%5BTitle%5D),  To profile several genes simultaneously, a cDNA macroarray was developed using 36 metal-related genes from rice, including ZIPs, NRAMPs, and YSLs (coding for known or potential metal transporters), as well as NAS, FER, FRO, NAAT, FDH, GSTU, and PDR (involved in metal homeostasis)
2. __transporter__, [Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray%5BTitle%5D),  To profile several genes simultaneously, a cDNA macroarray was developed using 36 metal-related genes from rice, including ZIPs, NRAMPs, and YSLs (coding for known or potential metal transporters), as well as NAS, FER, FRO, NAAT, FDH, GSTU, and PDR (involved in metal homeostasis)
