* **Key message**  
    + The point muta-tions, fon1-1 and fon1-2, disrupt meristem balance, resulting in alteration of floral organ numbers and the architecture of primary rachis branches
    + SEM analysis showed that the shoot apical meristems of fon1-3 mutants are enlarged
    + The rice FON1 gene controls vegetative and reproductive development by regulating shoot apical meristem size
    + Although floral meristems are strongly affected by the fon1-2 mutation, vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely normal, even in this strong allele
    + In addition, FON1 transcripts are detected in all meristems responsible for development of the aerial part of rice, suggesting that genes sharing functional redundancy with FON1 act in the vegetative and inflorescence meristems to mask the effects of the fon1 mutation
    + These results indicate that FON1 controls vegetative as well as reproductive development by regulating meristem size
    + Mutations in the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) cause enlargement of the floral meristem in Oryza sativa (rice), resulting in an increase in the number of all floral organs
    + Unlike CLV1, which is predominantly expressed in the L3 layer of the shoot meristem, FON1 is expressed throughout the whole floral meristem, suggesting that small modifications to the CLV signaling pathway may be required to maintain the floral meristem in rice
    + Rice FON1, which is an ortholog of Clv1, regulates stem cell proliferation and organ initiation
    + FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1) is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation

    + __FON1__, __MOC1__, [Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  MOC1 functions as a co-activator of MOC3, which did not directly bind to the FON1 promoter, but could further activate the FON1 expression in the presence of MOC3
    + __FON1__, __MOC1__, [Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Accordingly, FON1 is highly expressed at axillary meristems and shows remarkable decreased expression levels in moc1 and moc3 mutants
