* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that osfkf1 mutants flower late under SD, LD, and natural LD conditions
    + Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsFKF1 up-regulates expression of the floral activator Ehd2 and down-regulates expression of the floral repressor Ghd7; these regulators up- and down-regulate Ehd1 expression, respectively
    + In contrast to the LD-specific floral activator Arabidopsis FKF1, OsFKF1 likely acts as an autonomous floral activator because it promotes flowering independent of photoperiod, probably via its distinct roles in controlling expression of rice-specific genes including Ehd2, Ghd7, and Ehd1
