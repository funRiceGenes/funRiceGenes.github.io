* **Key message**  
    + Knockouts of FLR3 and/or FLR14 increased the number of white-core grains caused by aberrant accumulation of storage substances, resulting in poor grain quality
    + Conversely, the overexpression of FLR3 or FLR14 reduced grain chalkiness and improved grain quality
    + We also demonstrated that FLR3 and FLR14 reduced grain chalkiness by alleviating heat-induced oxidative stress in rice endosperm
    + Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that genes and metabolites involved in the oxidative stress response were significantly up-regulated in flr3 and flr14 grains
    + The content of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased in flr3 and flr14 mutant endosperm but decreased in overexpression lines
