* **Key message**  
    + Notably, flo7 peripheral endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound starch grain development
    + Together, our findings identify FLO7 as a unique plant regulator required for starch synthesis and amyloplast development within the peripheral endosperm and provide new insights into the spatial regulation of endosperm development in rice
    + Map-based cloning of FLO7 revealed that it encodes a protein of unknown function
    + Consistent with the phenotypic alternation in flo7 endosperm, the flo7 mutant had reduced amylose content and seriously disrupted amylopectin structure only in the peripheral endosperm
    + FLO7 harbors an N-terminal transit peptide capable of targeting functional FLO7 fused to green fluorescent protein to amyloplast stroma in developing endosperm cells, and a domain of unknown function 1338 (DUF1338) that is highly conserved in green plants
    + Furthermore, our combined Î²-glucuronidase activity and RNA in situ hybridization assays showed that the FLO7 gene was expressed ubiquitously but exhibited a specific expression in the endosperm periphery
    + Moreover, a set of in vivo experiments demonstrated that the missing 32 aa in the flo7 mutant protein are essential for the stable accumulation of FLO7 in the endosperm

    + __FLO7__, __OsbZIP60__, [OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsbZIP60 is found to activate the expression of key genes related to grain chalkiness, such as GPA3, FSE1, FLO7, Chalk5, OsNF-YB1, and OsPK2, whose expression is significantly suppressed in osbzip60 and overexpression lines of OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2, and OsBiP3
