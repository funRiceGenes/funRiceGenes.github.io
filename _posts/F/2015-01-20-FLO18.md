* **Publication**  
    + [Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM 18 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for 5&#39; processing of mitochondrial nad5 messenger RNA and endosperm development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM 18 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for 5&#39; processing of mitochondrial nad5 messenger RNA and endosperm development.%5BTitle%5D), 2021, J Integr Plant Biol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + These results suggested that FLO18 is involved in 5&#39;-end processing of nad5 messenger RNA and plays an important role in mitochondrial function and endosperm development
    + Map-based cloning and complementation tests showed that FLO18 encodes a mitochondrion-targeted P-type PPR protein with 15 PPR motifs
