## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6) gene in rice
2. __endosperm__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Significantly, flo6 mutant endosperm cells show obvious defects in compound granule formation
3. __seed__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds
4. __starch__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  In the flo6 mutant, the starch content is decreased and the normal physicochemical features of starch are changed
5. __starch__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, FLO6 can interact with isoamylase1 (ISA1) both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ISA1 does not bind to starch directly
6. __starch__, [FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds
