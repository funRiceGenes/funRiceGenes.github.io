* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6) gene in rice
    + Significantly, flo6 mutant endosperm cells show obvious defects in compound granule formation
    + We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds
    + In the flo6 mutant, the starch content is decreased and the normal physicochemical features of starch are changed
    + Furthermore, FLO6 can interact with isoamylase1 (ISA1) both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ISA1 does not bind to starch directly
