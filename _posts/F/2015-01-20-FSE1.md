* **Key message**  
    + Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing fse1 endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development
    + Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm, and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development
    + Map-based cloning showed that FSE1 encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1
