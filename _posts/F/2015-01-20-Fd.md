## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  The root Fd cDNA clone (pFDRR) was 603 bp long which contained 261-bp 5' region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acid residues and 342-bp 3' noncoding region
2. __root__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  The root Fd gene contained 1091-bp 5' upstream, 444-bp coding and 294-bp 3' noncoding regions
3. __root__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66~88%)
4. __root__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
5. __leaf__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66~88%)
6. __leaf__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Southern blot analysis using pFDRR and the rice leaf Fd cDNA (pFDRL) as a DNA probe identified their corresponding genomic Fd DNA
7. __nitrate__, [Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
