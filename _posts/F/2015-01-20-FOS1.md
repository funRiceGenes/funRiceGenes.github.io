## Genbank accession number

## Expression information

## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, FOS1 appears to be involved in maintenance of the SAM in the vegetative phase, because constitutive expression of FOS1 caused termination of the vegetative SAM
2. __meristem__, [FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Genetic analysis revealed that FOS1 does not need FON1, the putative receptor of FON2, for its action, suggesting that FOS1 and FON2 may function in meristem maintenance as signaling molecules in independent pathways

## Connection
1. __FON2~FON4__, __FOS1__, [FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the FON2 SPARE1 FOS1 gene encoding a CLE protein functions along with FON2 in maintenance of the FM

3. __FON2~FON4__, __FOS1__, [FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Sequence comparison of FOS1 in about 150 domesticated rice and wild rice species indicates that this FNP is present only in japonica, suggesting that redundant regulation by FOS1 and FON2 is commonplace in species in the Oryza genus
