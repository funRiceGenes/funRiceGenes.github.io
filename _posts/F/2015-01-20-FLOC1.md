* **Key message**  
    + These findings suggest that FLOC1 is involved not only in seed fertility but also in seed quality
    + these findings imply that there is a difference in the functions of FLO2 and FLOC1 although both of appear to be involved in the control of seed quality during seed formation
    + A knock-down transformant of FLOC1 showed significantly reducted fertility and generation of seeds with abnormal features
