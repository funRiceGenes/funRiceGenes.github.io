    + The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes
    + FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles,
    + FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, abnormal vascular development, small panicles, abnormal organ identity and defects in root development, together with a reduction in internal IAA levels.
    + From these results, we suggest that FIB plays a pivotal role in IAA biosynthesis in rice and that auxin biosynthesis, transport and sensitivity are closely interrelated.
    + TSG1 knockout resulted in an increased tiller number but reduction in grain number and size, and decrease in height
    + These findings suggest that TSG1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family, playing a prominent role in local auxin biosynthesis in rice
    + The tsg1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to IAA and the competitive inhibitor of aminotransferase, L-kynurenine
    + TSG1 encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase that is allelic to the FISH BONE (FIB) gene
    + Meanwhile, deletion of the TSG1 homologs OsTAR1, OsTARL1, and OsTARL2 caused no obvious changes, although the phenotype of the TSG1/OsTAR1 double mutant was intensified and infertile, suggesting gene redundancy in the rice tryptophan aminotransferase family
