    + [FLA, which encodes a homolog of UBP, is required for chlorophyll accumulation and development of lemma and palea in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FLA, which encodes a homolog of UBP, is required for chlorophyll accumulation and development of lemma and palea in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2019, Plant Cell Rep.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Our data suggest that FLA plays an important role in the development of floral organs and chloroplast in rice, but that this role probably does not involve deubiquitination activity, because FLA does not have an active site and deubiquitination activity
    + FLA is a ubiquitously expressed gene with the highest expression in floral organs
