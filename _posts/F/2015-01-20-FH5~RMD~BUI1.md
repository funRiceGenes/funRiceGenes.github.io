## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  FH5/RMD is ubiquitously expressed in rice tissues, and its protein localization to the chloroplast surface is mediated by the PTEN domain
2. __panicle__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
3. __growth__, [BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological observation indicated that the growth defects of bui1 were caused mainly by inhibition of cell expansion
4. __seed__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
5. __dwarf__, [BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development%5BTitle%5D)),  The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response
6. __seedling__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
7. __growth__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
8. __inflorescence__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
9. __cell elongation__, [RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological analysis showed that rmd mutants have severe cell elongation defects and abnormal microtubule and microfilament arrays
10. __panicle__, [BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development%5BTitle%5D)),  The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response

## Connection
1. __OsARF24__, __FH5~RMD~BUI1__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D)), Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
2. __OsARF24__, __FH5~RMD~BUI1__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D)), In support of this regulatory loop, osarf23 and lines with reduced expression of both OsARF23 and OsARF24 display reduced RMD expression, disrupted F-actin organization and cell growth, less sensitivity to auxin response, and altered auxin distribution and OsPIN localization.
