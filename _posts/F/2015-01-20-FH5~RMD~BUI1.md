* **Key message**  
    + FH5/RMD is ubiquitously expressed in rice tissues, and its protein localization to the chloroplast surface is mediated by the PTEN domain
    + The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
    + Cytological observation indicated that the growth defects of bui1 were caused mainly by inhibition of cell expansion
    + The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response
    + Cytological analysis showed that rmd mutants have severe cell elongation defects and abnormal microtubule and microfilament arrays
    + The rice rmd mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo
    + The rmd pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth
    + Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin organization
    + Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation in pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice
    + RMD protein localizes to the surface of statoliths, and rmd mutants exhibit faster gravitropic response owing to more rapid statoliths movement
    + Rice actin binding protein RMD controls crown root angle in response to external phosphate.
    + RMD is upregulated in response to low external phosphate and mutants lacking of RMD have steeper crown root growth angles that are unresponsive to phosphate levels
    + We conclude that adaptive changes to root angle in response to external phosphate availability are RMD dependent, providing a potential target for breeders
    + The rice actin-binding protein RMD regulates light-dependent shoot gravitropism.
    + By contrast, etiolated rmd shoots displayed normal negative shoot gravitropism
    + Furthermore, we show that RMD maintains an actin configuration that promotes statolith mobility in gravisensing endodermal cells, and for proper auxin distribution in light-grown, but not dark-grown, shoots
