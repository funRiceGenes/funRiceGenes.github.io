* **Key message**  
    + FH5/RMD is ubiquitously expressed in rice tissues, and its protein localization to the chloroplast surface is mediated by the PTEN domain
    + The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
    + Cytological observation indicated that the growth defects of bui1 were caused mainly by inhibition of cell expansion
    + The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response
    + Cytological analysis showed that rmd mutants have severe cell elongation defects and abnormal microtubule and microfilament arrays

    + __OsARF24__, __FH5~RMD~BUI1__, [Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth%5BTitle%5D), Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
