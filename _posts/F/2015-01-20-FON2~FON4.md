4. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __FON2~FON4__, [Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa)
5. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __FON2~FON4__, [Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM

9. __FON1__, __FON2~FON4__, [The floral organ number4 gene encoding a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 regulates apical meristem size in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The floral organ number4 gene encoding a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 regulates apical meristem size in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1) is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation
