* **Key message**  
    + We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
    + Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
    + The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period
