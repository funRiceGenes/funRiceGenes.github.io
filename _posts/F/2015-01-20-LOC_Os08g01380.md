* **Key message**  
    + Fd1 is more abundant than Fd2 in high nitrate, similar to LFNR2.
    + Fd2 mRNA is low under high-nitrate concentrations, although Fd1 is expressed at the same levels under any nitrogen conditions.
    + Loss-of-function fd1 mutants showed chlorosis and seedling lethality at the three-leaf stage
    + Electron transfer assays involving NADP+ and cytochrome c indicated that Fd1 can donate electrons from photosystem I (PSI) to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase
