* **Key message**  
    + Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing fse1 endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development
    + Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm, and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development
    + Map-based cloning showed that FSE1 encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1

* **Connection**  
    + __FSE1__, __OsbZIP60__, [OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsbZIP60 is found to activate the expression of key genes related to grain chalkiness, such as GPA3, FSE1, FLO7, Chalk5, OsNF-YB1, and OsPK2, whose expression is significantly suppressed in osbzip60 and overexpression lines of OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2, and OsBiP3
