* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we isolated a novel floury endosperm rice (Oryza sativa) mutant flo16 with defective starch grain (SG) formation
    + Overexpression of FLO16 significantly improved grain weight, suggesting a possible application of FLO16 in rice breeding
    + Our results indicated that FLO16 plays a critical role in redox homeostasis that is important for compound SG formation and subsequent starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm
    + Map-based cloning and complementation tests demonstrated that FLO16 encodes a NAD-dependent cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (CMDH)
