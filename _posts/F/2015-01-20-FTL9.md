* **Publication**  
    + [A leaf-emanated signal orchestrates grain size and number in response to maternal resources.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leaf-emanated signal orchestrates grain size and number in response to maternal resources.%5BTitle%5D), 2023, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We showed that FT-like 9 (FTL9) regulates both grain size and number and that maternal photosynthetic assimilates induce FTL9 expression in leaves to act as a long-range signal that increases grain number and reduces size
