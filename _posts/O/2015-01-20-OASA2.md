Tryptophan accumulation in transgenic rice expressing a feedback-insensitive mutant of OASA1%5BTitle%5D), The abundance of OASA2 transcripts is similar among tissues and greater than that of OASA1 transcripts; furthermore, OASA2 expression was induced by a chitin heptamer, a potent elicitor, suggesting that OASA2 participates in secondary metabolism
