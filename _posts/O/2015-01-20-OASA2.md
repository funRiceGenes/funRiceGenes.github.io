* **Key message**  
    + furthermore, OASA2 expression was induced by a chitin heptamer, a potent elicitor, suggesting that OASA2 participates in secondary metabolism.
    + These characteristics thus suggest that the NH2-termini of OASA1 and OASA2 also act as signal peptides for plastid localization
