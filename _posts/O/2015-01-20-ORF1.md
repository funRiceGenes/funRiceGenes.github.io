* **Key message**  
    + Taken together with gene function annotation and expression profiles, it indicates that ORF1 (LOC_Os06g10650), encoding a tyrosine phosphatase family protein might be the causal candidate gene for seed germination under salt stress in the qGR6.2 locus.
    + As reported previously, PTP family proteins have been reported to regulate signal transduction and control plant growth and development [33], and the PHD finger has been identified as one of the major families of histone reader domains, being involved in recognition of methylated H3K4 [34], so we speculated ORF1 (LOC_Os06g10650) and ORF5 (LOC_Os06g10690) might play similar functions in rice.
