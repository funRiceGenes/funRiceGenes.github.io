    + [FJ527826](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ527826)

* **Key message**  
    + This mutation, named opaque and growth retardation 1 (ogr1), was generated by T-DNA insertion into a gene that encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein containing the DYW motif
    + We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development
    + The OGR1-sGFP fusion protein is localized to mitochondria
    + Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria
