* **Key message**  
    + The om64 mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses
    + This study confirmed OM64 as a negative regulator  of rice herbivore resistance through regulating H2 O2 production
    + OM64 is a potentially efficient candidate to improve BPH and SSB resistance through gene deletion
    + Why the om64 mutant was resistant to both piercing-sucking and chewing  insects via a gene deficiency in mitochondria is discussed
    + OM64 protein is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane by subcellular localization and its deficiency constitutively activated H2 O2 signaling, which stimulated antibiosis and tolerance to BPH
    + Deficiency of mitochondrial outer membrane protein 64 confers rice resistance to both piercing-sucking and chewing insects in rice
    + The om64 mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses.
