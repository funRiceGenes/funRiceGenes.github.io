## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
2. __jasmonic acid__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
3. __defense__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8"

## Connection
1. __OPR8__, __OsRab11__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11
2. __OPR8__, __OsRab11__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included
3. __OPR8__, __OsRab11__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
4. __OPR8__, __OsRab11__, [Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8
