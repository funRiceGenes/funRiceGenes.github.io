* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OMTN2, OMTN3, OMTN4, and OMTN6 in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage.
    + OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes
    + Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
