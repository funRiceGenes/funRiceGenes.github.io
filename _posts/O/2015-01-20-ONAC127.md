* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that two seed-specific NAM/ATAF/CUC domain transcription factors, ONAC127 and ONAC129, are responsive to heat stress and involved in the grain filling process of rice
    + Overall, this study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving ONAC127 and ONAC129 and coordinating multiple pathways to modulate seed development and heat stress response at rice reproductive stage
    + ONAC127 and ONAC129 are dominantly expressed in the pericarp and can form a heterodimer during rice grain filling
    + These results suggest that ONAC127 and ONAC129 may regulate grain filling through affecting sugar transportation and abiotic stress responses
    + ChIP-seq analysis identified that the direct targets of ONAC127 and ONAC129 in developing rice seeds include monosaccharide transporter OsMST6, sugar transporter OsSWEET4, calmodulin-like protein OsMSR2 and AP2/ERF factor OsEATB
