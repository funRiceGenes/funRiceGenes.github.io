## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that the ONION1 ONI1 gene, which encodes a fatty acid elongase beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, is required for correct fatty acid composition and normal shoot development in rice
2. __shoot__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  oni1 mutants containing a reduced amount of very-long-chain fatty acids produced very small shoots, with an aberrant outermost epidermal cell layer, and ceased to grow soon after germination
3. __shoot__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
4. __shoot apical meristem__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
5. __meristem__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
