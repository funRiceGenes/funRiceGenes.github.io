* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, OCP might be the cornerstone of blast resistance by suppressing the activation of JA and ET signaling pathways as well as promoting auxin signaling pathways
    + Knockout of a papain-like cysteine protease gene OCP enhances blast resistance in rice.
    + Therefore, OCP negatively regulates blast resistance in rice by interacting with OsRACK1A or OsSNAP32 and influencing the expression profiles of many resistance-related genes
    + OCP was expressed in all rice tissues and mainly located in the cytoplasm
