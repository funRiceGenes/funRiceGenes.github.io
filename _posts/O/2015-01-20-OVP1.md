* **Key message**  
    + Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-qPCR) showed that OVP1 was induced by cold stress
    + OVP1 overexpression resulted in enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic rice, which was related to an increased integrity of cell membrane, decreased MDA content and accumulation of proline to higher level as compared with wild type rice seedlings
    + OVP1, a vacuolar H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase), overexpression improved rice cold tolerance
