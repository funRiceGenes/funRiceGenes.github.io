* **Key message**  
    + Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated OsCPK25/26-interacting protein 30 (OIP30), which is also predominantly expressed in pollen
    + OIP30 may be the potential downstream substrate for OsCPK25/26 in pollen
    + OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice
