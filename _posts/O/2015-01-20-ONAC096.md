* **Key message**  
    + Mutation of ONAC096 Enhances Grain Yield by Increasing Panicle Number and Delaying Leaf Senescence during Grain Filling in Rice.
    + Here, we report that rice ONAC096 affects grain yield by regulating leaf senescence and panicle number
    + Two independent T-DNA insertion mutants (onac096-1 and onac096-2) with downregulated ONAC096 expression retained their green leaf color during natural senescence in the field, thus extending their photosynthetic capacity
    + Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis showed that ONAC096 upregulated genes controlling chlorophyll degradation and leaf senescence
    + ONAC096 mediates abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence by upregulating the ABA signaling genes ABA INSENSITIVE5 and ENHANCED EM LEVEL
    + ONAC096 expression increased rapidly in rice leaves upon the initiation of aging- and dark-induced senescence
    + Repressed OsCKX2 (encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) expression in the onac096 mutants led to a 15% increase in panicle number without affecting grain weight or fertility
    + The onac096 mutants showed a 16% increase in grain yield, highlighting the potential for using this gene to increase grain production
