## Publication
1. [ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2013, Plant Cell Physiol.

## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The midrib of oni2 leaf blades was not developed correctly
2. __shoot__, [ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  onion2 oni2 mutants produced very small shoots in which leaves were fused to each other, and ceased growing after germination
3. __shoot__, [ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that ONI2 is a layer 1-specific gene required for development of the entire shoot and that VLCFAs play an essential role in normal shoot development in rice
