* **Publication**  
    + [ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2013, Plant Cell Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The midrib of oni2 leaf blades was not developed correctly
    + onion2 (oni2) mutants produced very small shoots in which leaves were fused to each other, and ceased growing after germination
    + These results suggest that ONI2 is a layer 1-specific gene required for development of the entire shoot and that VLCFAs play an essential role in normal shoot development in rice
