1. __seed__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
2. __grain__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
3. __salt__, [Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of OCPI1 promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses
