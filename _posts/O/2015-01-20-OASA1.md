* **Key message**  
    + OASA1 is expressed in all tissues tested, but the amount of its mRNA was greater in panicles than in leaves and roots

Tryptophan accumulation in transgenic rice expressing a feedback-insensitive mutant of OASA1%5BTitle%5D), Two genes, OASA1 and OASA2, encoding AS alpha-subunits were isolated from a monocotyledonous plant, rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare), and were characterized

Tryptophan accumulation in transgenic rice expressing a feedback-insensitive mutant of OASA1%5BTitle%5D), The abundance of OASA2 transcripts is similar among tissues and greater than that of OASA1 transcripts; furthermore, OASA2 expression was induced by a chitin heptamer, a potent elicitor, suggesting that OASA2 participates in secondary metabolism
