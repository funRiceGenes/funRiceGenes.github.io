* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that the ONION1 (ONI1) gene, which encodes a fatty acid elongase (beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase) involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, is required for correct fatty acid composition and normal shoot development in rice
    + oni1 mutants containing a reduced amount of very-long-chain fatty acids produced very small shoots, with an aberrant outermost epidermal cell layer, and ceased to grow soon after germination
    + ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
