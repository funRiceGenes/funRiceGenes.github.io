## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  High levels of ONAC300 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves
2. __culm__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles
3. __flower__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, ONAC300 is a novel member of the NAC family which is expressed at very early developmental stages in the shoot, root and flower, as well as in the mature phloem of vascular tissues in rice
4. __panicle__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles
5. __shoot apical meristem__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  High levels of ONAC300 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves
6. __root__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The use of an ONAC300:: GUS reporter gene revealed that the ONAC300 promoter was expressed predominantly in developing vascular tissues of the leaves and roots
7. __root__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles

9. __shoot__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  High levels of ONAC300 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves
10. __shoot__, [Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, ONAC300 is a novel member of the NAC family which is expressed at very early developmental stages in the shoot, root and flower, as well as in the mature phloem of vascular tissues in rice
