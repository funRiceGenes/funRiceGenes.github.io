* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of a Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Gene ONAC022 Improves Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.
    + Three independent transgenic rice lines with overexpression of ONAC022 were generated and used to explore the function of ONAC022 in drought and salt stress tolerance
    + Our data demonstrate that ONAC022 functions as a stress-responsive NAC with transcriptional activator activity and plays a positive role in drought and salt stress tolerance through modulating an ABA-mediated pathway
    + The ONAC022 protein was localized to nucleus when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana
    + Expression of ONAC022 was induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA)
