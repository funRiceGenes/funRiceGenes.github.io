* **Key message**  
    + Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues
    + Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development
    + Furthermore OsOPT7 did not complement the growth of yeast fet3fet4 mutant
    + Microarray analysis of OsOPT7 knockout 1 (opt7-1) revealed the upregulation of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes in plants grown under Fe-sufficient conditions, despite the high Fe and ferritin concentrations in shoot tissue indicating that Fe may not be available for physiological functions
    + Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.
    + OsOPT7 localized to the plasma membrane and did not transport Fe(III)-DMA or Fe(II)-NA and GSH in Xenopus laevis oocytes
