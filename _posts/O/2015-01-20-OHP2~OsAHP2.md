* **Key message**  
    + LEPTO1 can interact with two rice authentic histidine phosphotransfer proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, via its DDK domain.

* **Connection**  
    + __LEPTO1~OsRR24~DLC1__, __OHP2~OsAHP2__, [The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of  Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of  Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis%5BTitle%5D), LEPTO1 interacts with two authentic histidine phosphotransfer (AHP) proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, via the DDK domain, and a phosphomimetic mutation of the DDK domain relieves its repression of LEPTO1 transactivation activity.
    + __GL3.1~qGL3-1~qGL3~OsPPKL1__, __OHP2~OsAHP2__, [A Cryptic Inhibitor of Cytokinin Phosphorelay Controls Rice Grain Size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Cryptic Inhibitor of Cytokinin Phosphorelay Controls Rice Grain Size%5BTitle%5D), PPKL1 interacts with OsAHP2, one of authentic HPs, and D364 resides in a region resembling the receiver domain of RRs.
