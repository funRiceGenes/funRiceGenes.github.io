* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OFP3  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + While knockout of OFP3 promoted rice seedling growth, overexpression of OFP3 led to strong BR insensitivity, which resulted in reduced plant height, leaf angle, and grain size
    + GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.
    + Here, we identified OFP3 (OVATE FAMILY PROTEIN 3) as an interactor of both GSK2 and DLT by yeast two-hybrid screening and demonstrated that OFP3 plays a distinctly negative role in BR responses
    + Moreover, treatment with either BR or bikinin, a GSK3-like kinase inhibitor, induced OFP3 depletion, whereas GSK2 or brassinazole, a BR synthesis inhibitor, promoted OFP3 accumulation
