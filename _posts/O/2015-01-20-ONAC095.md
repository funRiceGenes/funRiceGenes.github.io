* **Key message**  
    + Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance.
    + Expression of ONAC095 was up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) but down-regulated by cold stress
    + Functional analyses through dominant chimeric repressor-mediated suppression of ONAC095 demonstrate that ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance, acting as a negative regulator of drought response but as a positive regulator of cold response in rice
