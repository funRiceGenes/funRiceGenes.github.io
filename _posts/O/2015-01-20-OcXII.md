* **Key message**  
    + Meanwhile, rice plants silenced at the whole OcXII gene presented higher legumain and papain-like proteolytic activities, resulting in a faster initial seedling growth
    + Interestingly, the activity of OcXII promoter gene was detected in the rice seed scutellum region, and decreases with seedling growth
    + Seeds from these plants also exhibited slower growth at germination under ABA or alkaline conditions, while maintaining very high levels of OcXII transcriptional activation
    + Overall, the results of this study highlight the association of OcXII with not only plant development processes, but also with stress response pathways
