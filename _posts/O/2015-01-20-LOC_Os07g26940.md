* **Key message**  
    + Rice ORMDL controls sphingolipid homeostasis affecting fertility resulting from abnormal pollen development.
    + We found that the RNAi transgenic plants with low expression of either LOC_Os07g26940 alone or all three ORMDL genes were sterile, having abnormal pollen morphology and staining
    + Our results indicated that plant ORMDL proteins influence sphingolipid homeostasis, and deletion of this gene affected fertility resulting from abnormal pollen development
