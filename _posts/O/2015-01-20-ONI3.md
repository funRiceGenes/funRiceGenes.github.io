## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss-of-function mutations of ONI3, which were identified as mutants with ectopic expression of KNOX genes in leaves and morphologically resembling KNOX overexpressors, showed abnormal organ fusions in developing shoots
2. __shoot__, [Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analyses showed that ONI3 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer in the shoot apex throughout life cycle, and the oni3 mutants had an aberrant outermost cell layer
