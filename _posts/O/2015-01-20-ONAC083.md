* **Key message**  
    + The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.
    + Knockout of ONAC083 enhanced rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae, strengthened pathogen-induced defense responses, and boosted chitin-induced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), whereas ONAC083 overexpression had the opposite effects
    + ONAC083 localizes to the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activity that depended on its C-terminal region
    + These data demonstrate that ONAC083 negatively contributes to rice immunity against M
