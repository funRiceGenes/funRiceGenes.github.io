## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D), " In this study, a rice NAC gene, ONAC045, was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in abiotic stress resistance"
2. __temperature__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D), " Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid ABA treatment in leaves and roots"
3. __transcription factor__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice
4. __root__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid ABA treatment in leaves and roots
5. __drought__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D), " Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid ABA treatment in leaves and roots
6. __drought__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ONAC045 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments
7. __drought__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice"
8. __salt__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D), " Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid ABA treatment in leaves and roots
9. __salt__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ONAC045 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments
10. __salt__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice"
