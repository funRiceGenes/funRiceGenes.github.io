* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrate that the timing of tapetum PCD must be tightly regulated for successful pollen development, and that EDT1 is involved in the tapetum PCD process
    + EDT1 localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as observed in rice protoplast transient assays
    + EDT1 encodes a subunit of ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), and is specifically expressed in the tapetum of anthers
