* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy
    + We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1
    + As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, EG1 reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty-glume fate and spikelet development
    + In addition to affecting the identity and number of empty glumes, mutations in EG1 caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls
    + EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia
    + We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development
    + Collectively, our results demonstrate that EG1 promotes floral robustness against temperature fluctuation by safeguarding the expression of floral identify genes through a high temperature-dependent mitochondrial lipid pathway and uncovers a novel mechanistic insight into floral developmental control
    + Furthermore, we found that numerous environmentally responsive genes including many floral identity genes are transcriptionally repressed in eg1 mutants and OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsG1 genetically act downstream of EG1 to maintain floral robustness
    + GY1 functions at the initial step of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to repress mesocotyl and coleoptile elongation in etiolated rice seedlings
    + Ethylene inhibits the expression of GY1 and other genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway to reduce JA levels and enhance mesocotyl and coleoptile growth by promoting cell elongation
    + Genetically, GY1 acts downstream of the OsEIN2-mediated ethylene signaling pathway to regulate mesocotyl/coleoptile growth
    + GY1 was identified through map-based cloning and encodes a PLA1-type phospholipase that localizes in chloroplasts
