* **Key message**  
    + The effective panicles and seed-setting rate were reduced in the ETR2-overexpressing plants, while thousand-seed weight was substantially enhanced in both the ETR2-RNAi plants and the etr2 mutant compared with controls
    + Here, we characterized a subfamily II ethylene receptor, ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 (ETR2), in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Overexpression of ETR2 in transgenic rice plants reduced ethylene sensitivity and delayed floral transition
    + Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the ETR2 T-DNA insertion mutant etr2 showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering
    + The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice
    + Cloning of a cDNA encoding an ETR2-like protein (Os-ERL1) from deep water rice (Oryza sativa L.) and increase in its mRNA level by submergence, ethylene, and gibberellin treatments
    + The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant
    + Thus, ETR2 may delay flowering and cause starch accumulation in stems by regulating downstream genes
    + Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed
    + A cDNA from deep water rice treated with ethylene, encoding an ethylene receptor homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana ETR2 and EIN4, was isolated using differential display and RACE techniques
    + The cDNA (2880 bp), corresponding to the Os-ERL1 gene (Oryza sativa ETHYLENE RESPONSE 2 like 1; GenBank accession number AB107219), contained an open reading frame of 2289 bp coding for 763 amino acids
    + The Os-ERL1 gene was up-regulated by flooding, and by treatment with ethylene and gibberellin
    + Starch granules accumulated in the internodes of the ETR2-overexpressing plants, but not in the etr2 mutant
    + Furthermore, instead of the constitutive expression profile of OsERS1, OsETR2 is differentially expressed in seedlings of light/dark-grown conditions, submergence or exogenous ethylene treatments
    + Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and OsETR2 could have different roles during rice plant submergence
    + The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.
    + OsERS1 and OsETR2 are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions
    + Base on the results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas OsETR2 could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum
