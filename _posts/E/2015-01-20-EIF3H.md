    + Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82
