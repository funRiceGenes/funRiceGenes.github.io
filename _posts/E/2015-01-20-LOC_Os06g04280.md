* **Key message**  
    + Here, we describe the development of glyphosate-resistant rice lines by site-specific amino acid substitutions (G172A, T173I, and P177S: GATIPS-mOsEPSPS) and modification of phosphoenolpyruvate-binding site in the native OsEPSPS gene employing fragment knockout and knock-in of homology donor repair (HDR) template harboring desired mutations through CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing
    + Together, results highlighted that the efficacy of GATIPS mutations in OsEPSPS has tremendously contributed in glyphosate resistance (foliar spray of 6 ml/L), enhanced aromatic amino acids, and improved grain yields in rice
