* **Key message**  
    + OsClo5 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by interacting with OsDi19-5 to negatively affect salt stress tolerance in rice seedlings
    + In addition, OsClo5 enhanced the inhibitory effect of OsDi19-5 in the tobacco transient system, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in rice seedlings under salt stress
    + Thereby, biochemical and molecular genetic experiments were carried out, the results revealed that OsClo5 had was able to bind calcium and phospholipids in vitro and localized in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum in rice protoplasts
