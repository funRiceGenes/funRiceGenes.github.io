* **Key message**  
    + It was found that the level of active gibberellin was elevated in the mutant, whereas its growth in response to gibberellin is similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that the higher level accumulation of gibberellin in the eui1 mutant causes the abnormal elongation of the uppermost internode
    + Overexpression of EUI1 gave rise to the gibberellin-deficient-like phenotypes, which could be partially reversed by supplementation with gibberellin
    + Furthermore, apart from the alteration of expression levels of the gibberellin biosynthesis genes, accumulation of SLR1 protein was found in the overexpressing transgenic plants, indicating that the expression level of EUI1 is implicated in both gibberellin-mediated SLR1 destruction and a feedback regulation in gibberellin biosynthesis
    + Therefore, we proposed that EUI1 plays a negative role in gibberellin-mediated regulation of cell elongation in the uppermost internode of rice
    + EUI1, encoding a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, regulates internode elongation by modulating gibberellin responses in rice
    + Here, we report a detailed characterization of an elongated uppermost internode1 (eui1) mutant, which has been used in hybrid rice breeding
    + We cloned the EUI1 gene, which encodes a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, by map-based cloning and found that EUI1 was weakly expressed in most tissues, but preferentially in young panicles
    + The expression of Eui1 is finely tuned, thereby maintaining homeostasis of endogenous bioactive GA and producing plants of normal plant height
    + This complex generates closed chromatin at Eui1, suppressing Eui1 expression and modulating GA homeostasis
    + Here, we identified a dominant dwarf mutant, dEui1, caused by the deletion of an RY motif-containing cis silencing element (SE1) in the intron of Eui1
    + OsCYP714D1 improves plant growth and salt tolerance through regulating gibberellin and ion homeostasis in transgenic poplar.
    + Previously, we reported that expression of the rice cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene OsCYP714D1 increased gibberellic acid (GA) accumulation and shoot growth in transgenic poplar
    + Our findings imply that OsCYP714D1 participated in the regulation of both shoot growth and salt resistance through regulating gibberellin and ion homeostasis in transgenic poplar, and it can be used as a candidate gene for the engineering of new tree varieties with improved biomass production and salt stress resistance
    + In this work, we demonstrate that expression of OsCYP714D1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic poplar plants
    + Transcriptomic analyses revealed that OsCYP714D1 expression up-regulated the expressions of GA biosynthesis, signaling and stress responsive genes in transgenic plants under both normal and high salt stress conditions
