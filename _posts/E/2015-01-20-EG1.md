## Key message
1. __floral meristem__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy

5. __spikelet__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, EG1 reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty-glume fate and spikelet development
6. __floral__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy

10. __inflorescence__, [A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia
11. __JA biosynthesis__, [Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development

2. __EG1__, __OsIG1__, [Down-regulation of a LBD-like gene, OsIG1, leads to occurrence of unusual double ovules and developmental abnormalities of various floral organs and megagametophyte in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Down-regulation of a LBD-like gene, OsIG1, leads to occurrence of unusual double ovules and developmental abnormalities of various floral organs and megagametophyte in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Additionally, down-regulation of OsIG1 differentially affected the expression of genes associated with the floral organ development including EG1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS1.
