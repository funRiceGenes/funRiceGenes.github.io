    + Novel alleles of rice eIF4G generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.
    + To develop new sources of resistance to RTD, mutations in eIF4G were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the RTSV-susceptible variety IR64, widely grown across tropical Asia
    + Among various mutated eIF4G alleles examined, only those resulting in in-frame mutations in SVLFPNLAGKS residues (mainly NL), adjacent to the YVV residues, conferred resistance
    + Genome Editing of Rice eIF4G Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus
    + To develop novel resources for resistance to RBSDV through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, a guide RNA sequence targeting exon 1 of eIF4G was designed and cloned into a binary vector, pHUE401
    + These results indicate that site-specific mutation of rice eIF4G successfully conferred partial resistance specific to RBSDV associated with less transcription of eIF4G in mutants
    + However, the eif4g mutant plants showed the same sensitivity to rice stripe virus (RSV) infection as wild-type plants
