## Key message
1. __flower__, [OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged
2. __flower__, [OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a

4. __flower__, [OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a%5BTitle%5D)),  In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1
5. __flower__, [OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a%5BTitle%5D)), OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a
6. __height__, [A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning
7. __grain__, [A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning
8. __flower__, [OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
9. __flower__, [Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)), Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1
10. __flower__, [Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both Hd1 and Ehd1 flowering pathways
11. __heading date__, [Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants
12. __flower__, [Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  Since the two genes Se1 (= Hd1) and Ef1 (= Ehd1) are known to up-regulate the rice homolog of Arabidopsis FT, it is suggested that the detected epistasis may respond to diverse environments by modulating the CO/FT system conserved in flowering plants
13. __flower__, [A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice
14. __flower__, [A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Among these regulators, Ehd1, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions
15. __leaf__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf
16. __shoot__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development
17. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)), OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
18. __panicle__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The results revealed that the combination of Heading-date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) can reduce the number of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time
19. __panicle__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development
20. __panicle__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf
21. __flower__, [A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions
22. __heading date__, [Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  The comparison of the nucleotide sequences suggested that Ef1 is the same as Early heading date 1 (Ehd1)
23. __floral__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction
24. __heading date__, [Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza%5BTitle%5D)),  We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice
25. __heading date__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome)
26. __heading date__, [DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously%5BTitle%5D)),  The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions

30. __floral__, [Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants
31. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome)
32. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice
33. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1
34. __floral__, [LHD1, an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, controls late heading date in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LHD1, an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, controls late heading date in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)%5BTitle%5D)),  We also found that LHD1 could down-regulate the expression of several floral transition activators such as Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions, but not under short-day conditions
35. __flower__, [Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  OsId1 regulates the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) and its downstream genes, including Hd3a (a rice ortholog of FT) and RFT1 (Rice Flowering Locus T1), under both SD and LD conditions
36. __flower__, [Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, the expression of Ehd1 is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51
37. __flower__, [Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  This study demonstrates that the activation of Ehd1 by OsId1 is required for the promotion of flowering
