* **Key message**  
    + Here, we cloned the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene EDR1 (Endosperm Development in Rice) responsible for differential endosperm development between upland rice and paddy rice by performing QTL analysis and map-based cloning
    + Natural variations in EDR1 significantly reduced the UDP-glucosyltransferase activity of EDR1(YZN) compared to EDR1(YD1) , resulting in abnormal endosperm development in the near-isogenic line (NIL), accompanied by insufficient grains and changes in grain quality
    + Taken together, these results suggest that the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene EDR1 is an important determinant controlling differential endosperm development between upland rice and paddy rice
    + EDR1 was highly expressed in developing seeds during grain filling
