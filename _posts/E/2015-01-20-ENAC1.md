## Key message
1. __drought__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D), " Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid"
2. __ ABA __, [ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  The promoter sequence of ENAC1 harbors several cis-elements including ABA response elements, but the well-known dehydration responsive element/C-repeat element is absent
3. __abiotic stress__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D), " In this research, a full-length cDNA named ENAC1 early NAC-domain protein induced by abiotic stress 1 was isolated from rice
4. __abiotic stress__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D),  Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid
5. __abiotic stress__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D),  However, the induction of ENAC1 by abiotic stress was transient and lasted up to 3 h, whereas that of OsDREB1A maintained longer
6. __abiotic stress__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, ENAC1 may be an early transcription activator of stress responses and function in the regulation of NACRS-mediated gene expression under abiotic stress
7. __abiotic stress__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D), ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."
8. __salt__, ["ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L."%5BTitle%5D), " Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid"
9. __transcription factor__, [ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice Oryza sativa L.)
