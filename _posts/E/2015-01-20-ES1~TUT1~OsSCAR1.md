* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Expression of ES1 is higher in the leaves and leaf sheaths than in other tissues, consistent with its role in controlling water loss from leaves
    + EARLY SENESCENCE 1 Encodes a SCAR-like Protein2 that Affects Water Loss in Rice
    + The tut1 also shows a pleiotropic phenotype, characterized by short roots, reduced plant height, and abnormal development of anthers and pollen grains
    + These results indicate that TUT1 is a functional SCAR/WAVE protein and plays an important role in panicle development
