* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates seed size by targeting EXPLA1 for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
    + GW2 and EXPLA1 colocalized to the nucleus when expressed simultaneously

* **Connection**  
    + __EXPLA1__, __GW2~OsGW2__, [GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we show that rice Grain Width 2 (GW2), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, can control seed development by catalyzing the ubiquitination of expansin-like 1 (EXPLA1), a cell wall-loosening protein that increases cell growth
    + __EXPLA1__, __GW2~OsGW2__, [GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=GW2 Functions as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for Rice Expansin-Like 1.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays showed a strong interaction between GW2 and EXPLA1
