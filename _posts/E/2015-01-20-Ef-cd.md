* **Key message**  
    + Ef-cd facilitates nitrogen utilization and also improves the photosynthesis rate
    + Therefore, Ef-cd could be a vital contributor of elite early maturing hybrid varieties in balancing grain yield with maturity duration
    + Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.
    + Field test comparisons of early maturing Ef-cd near-isogenic lines with their wild types as well as of the derivative early maturing hybrids with their wild-type hybrids conducted under different latitudes determined that the early maturing Ef-cd allele shortens maturity duration (ranging from 7 to 20 d) without a concomitant yield penalty

    + __Ef-cd__, __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, [Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.%5BTitle%5D),  The Ef-cd locus gives rise to a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense transcript overlapping the OsSOC1 gene
    + __Ef-cd__, __OsMADS50~OsSOC1~DTH3__, [Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ef-cd locus shortens rice maturity duration without yield penalty.%5BTitle%5D),  Ef-cd lncRNA expression positively correlates with the expression of OsSOC1 and H3K36me3 deposition
