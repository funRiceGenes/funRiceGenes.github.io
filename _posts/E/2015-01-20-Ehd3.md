5. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1
6. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D),  Our results demonstrate that the PHD-finger gene Ehd3 acts as a promoter in the unique genetic pathway responsible for photoperiodic flowering in rice
7. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D), Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering
8. __floral__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D),  Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction
