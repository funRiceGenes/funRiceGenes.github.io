* **Key message**  
    + Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice
    + Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species
    + Among the five ethylene receptor genes, the expression levels of both OS-ETR3 and OS-ETR4 were too low to be detected by the northern blot analysis
