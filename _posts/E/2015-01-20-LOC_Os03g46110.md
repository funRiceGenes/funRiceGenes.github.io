* **Key message**  
    + Grass-Specific EPAD1 Is Essential for Pollen Exine Patterning in Rice
    + EPAD1 is specifically expressed in male meiocytes, indicating that reproductive cells exert genetic control over exine patterning
    + EPAD1 possesses an N-terminal signal peptide and three redundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor sites at its C-terminus, segments required for its function and localization to the microspore plasma membrane
    + We propose that plasma membrane lipids bound by EPAD1 may be involved in recruiting and arranging regulatory proteins in the primexine to drive correct exine deposition
    + Disruption of EPAD1 leads to abnormal exine pattern and complete male sterility, although sporopollenin biosynthesis is unaffected
