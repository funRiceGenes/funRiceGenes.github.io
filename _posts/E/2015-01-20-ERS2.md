* **Key message**  
    + However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene
    + Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice
    + Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species
    + Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice
