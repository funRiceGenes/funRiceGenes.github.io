## Key message
1. __iaa__, [Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions%5BTitle%5D),  However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene
2. __ethylene__, [Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions%5BTitle%5D), Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice
3. __ethylene__, [Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions%5BTitle%5D),  Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species
4. __ethylene__, [Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions%5BTitle%5D),  However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene
