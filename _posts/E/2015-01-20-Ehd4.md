## Key message
1. __flower__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long-day conditions
2. __flower__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice

4. __flowering time__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice
5. __heading date__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 Ehd4)  

## Connection
1. __Ehd4__, __Hd3a__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
2. __Ehd4__, __RFT1__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
