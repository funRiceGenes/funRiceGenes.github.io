* **Key message**  
    + To enhance our understanding of GA metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa), we intensively screened and identified 29 candidate genes encoding the following GA metabolic enzymes using all available rice DNA databases: ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox)

* **Connection**  
    + __KAO__, __NAL2~OsWOX3A~WOX3__, [OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice Oryza sativa.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice Oryza sativa.%5BTitle%5D), Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that OsWOX3A directly interacts with the KAO promoter
    + __KAO__, __NAL2~OsWOX3A~WOX3__, [Regulatory role of the OsWOX3A transcription factor in rice root development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Regulatory role of the OsWOX3A transcription factor in rice root development.%5BTitle%5D), In a recent study, we demonstrated that OsWOX3A directly binds to the promoter of the KAO gene, which encodes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, and represses KAO expression
