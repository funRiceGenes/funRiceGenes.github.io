## Expression information

## Key message
1. __sheath__, [Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit%5BTitle%5D)),  Leaf sheaths were found to contain higher levels of KOB1 protein than the blade portions of leaves
2. __growth__, [Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Yeast co-expressing PutAKT1 and the beta subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) had better growth and higher K+-uptake ability than yeast expressing PutAKT1 alone
3. __growth__, [Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, yeast co-expressing the beta subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) with OsAKT1 had slower growth and lower K+ uptake than yeast expressing OsAKT1 alone
4. __leaf__, [Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit%5BTitle%5D)),  Later-developing leaves on a rice plant were found to contain increasing levels of the protein with the flag leaf having the highest titer of KOB1
5. __leaf__, [Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit%5BTitle%5D)),  Leaf sheaths were found to contain higher levels of KOB1 protein than the blade portions of leaves
6. __root__, [Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression studies indicated that KOB1 protein is more abundant in leaves than in either reproductive structures or roots
7. __homeostasis__, [Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)), Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis
8. __reproductive__, [Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression studies indicated that KOB1 protein is more abundant in leaves than in either reproductive structures or roots
