## Key message
1. __cell cycle__, [The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that Orysa;KRP3 is involved in cell cycle control of syncytial endosperm

3. __endosperm__, [The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Orysa;KRP3 is expressed in multinucleate syncytial endosperm at 2 DAF, but not in cellularized endosperm at 3 DAF
4. __endosperm__, [The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggest that Orysa;KRP3 is involved in cell cycle control of syncytial endosperm
5. __endosperm__, [The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm%5BTitle%5D), The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm
6. __cell division__, [The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice Oryza sativa L. syncytial endosperm%5BTitle%5D),  Orysa;KRP3 was able to rescue yeast premature cell division due to the dominant positive expression of mutant rice CDKA;1 indicating that Orysa;KRP3 inhibited rice CDK
