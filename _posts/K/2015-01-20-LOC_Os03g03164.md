* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Biochemical and gene expression analyses revealed that rice KNAT7 interacts with a secondary wall key regulator, NAC31, and a cell growth master regulator, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4)
    + A loss-of-function mutation in KNAT7 enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size
    + Overexpression of KNAT7 gave rise to the opposite phenotypes, with plants having weaker cell walls and smaller grains
