## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development
2. __seed development__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D), The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice
3. __cell cycle__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation
4. __leaf__, [Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants
5. __leaf__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development
6. __endosperm__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells
7. __endosperm__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development
8. __seed__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling
