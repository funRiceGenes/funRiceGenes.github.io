* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that the black grain trait originated from ectopic expression of the Kala4 bHLH gene due to rearrangement in the promoter region

* **Connection**  
    + __Kala4__, __Rc~qSD7-1~qPC7__, [The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.%5BTitle%5D),  Both the Rc and Kala4 genes activate upstream flavonol biosynthesis genes, such as chalcone synthase and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, and downstream genes, such as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, to produce the respective specific pigments
