## Key message
1. __floral__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs
2. __ ga __, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  The putative OsKS2 gene was a chromosome 4-located ent-kaurene synthase KS), encoding the enzyme that catalyses an early step of the GA biosynthesis pathway
3. __dwarf__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin GA biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene
4. __dwarf__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants
5. __dwarf__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  Further investigation on OsKS2 and other OsKS-like proteins is underway and may yield better understanding of the putative role of OsKS in severe dwarf mutants
6. __gibberellin__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin GA biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene
7. __stem__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs
8. __growth__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D),  We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants
