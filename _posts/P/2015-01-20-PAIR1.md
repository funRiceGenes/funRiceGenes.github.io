* **Key message**  
    + Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
    + These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
    + However, chromosomal fragmentation frequent in plant meiotic mutants was never observed in all of the pair1 meiocytes
    + CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
    + Expression of the PAIR1 gene was detected in the early stages of flower development, in which the majority of the sporocytes had not entered meiosis
    + Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants
    + We have identified and characterized a novel gene, PAIR1 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1), required for homologous chromosome pairing and cytokinesis in male and female meiocytes of rice (Oryza sativa)
    + The pair1 mutation, tagged by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, exhibited meiosis-specific defects and resulted in complete sterility in male and female gametes
    + These observations clarify that the PAIR1 protein plays an essential role in establishment of homologous chromosome pairing in rice meiosis
