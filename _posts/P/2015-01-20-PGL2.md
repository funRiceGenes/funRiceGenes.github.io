## Key message
1. __grain length__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report the involvement of another atypical bHLH protein gene, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 PGL2), in the regulation of rice grain length
2. __grain length__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D),  Over-expression of PGL2 in the lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in correlation with the level of transgene expression
3. __grain length__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D),  PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo
4. __grain length__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D),  It was reported that overexpression of BU1 BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1), the closest homolog of PGL2, caused an increase in grain length
5. __grain length__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D),  These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG
6. __palea__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D),  Over-expression of PGL2 in the lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in correlation with the level of transgene expression
