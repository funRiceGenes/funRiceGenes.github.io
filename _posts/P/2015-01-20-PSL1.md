* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + psl1 with a 260-bp deletion in its gene displayed leaf rolling in response to high light intensity and/or low humidity
    + Taken together, PSL1 functions as a PG that modifies cell wall biosynthesis, plant development and drought tolerance in rice
    + The PSL1 gene encodes a cell wall-localised polygalacturonase (PG), a pectin-degrading enzyme
    + Significant modifications to cell wall composition in the psl1 mutant compared with the wild-type plants were identified
