1. __growth__, [Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
2. __gibberellin__, [Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
3. __cell division__, [Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
