    + [AB462325](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB462325)

* **Key message**  
    + The results of the complementation analysis and an evaluation of the resistance specificity of the transgenic lines to blast isolates demonstrated that Pikm-specific resistance is conferred by cooperation of Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS
