* **Information**  
    + Symbol: Pi64  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Mol Plant Microbe Interact.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene
    + Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars
    + Pi64 is constitutively expressed at all development stages and in all tissues examined
    + Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus
