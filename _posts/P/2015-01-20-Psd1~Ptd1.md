* **Key message**  
    + The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day
    + The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment
    + Furthermore, we found that the growth inhibition in Ptd1 might result from the special protein conformation of Ptd1 due to loss of two disulfide bonds in the Eight-cysteine motif (8-CM) that is conserved among nsLTPs
