* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified a sterile rice mutant and cloned a new meiotic gene, OsBVF1 (Bivalent Formation 1) by map-based cloning
    + Molecular genetics and cytological approaches were carried out to address the function of OsBVF1 in meiosis
    + Our study demonstrates that OsBVF1 is a novel plant-conserved factor involved in meiotic recombination in rice, providing a new insight into understanding of meiotic progression regulation
