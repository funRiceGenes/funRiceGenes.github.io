* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We report the isolation of Pi1, a gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae)
    + The isolation of Pi1, an allele at the Pik locus which confers broad spectrum resistance to rice blast
    + Three major genes (Pi1, Piz-5 and Pita) for blast resistance on chromosomes 11, 6 and 12, respectively, were fine-mapped and closely linked RFLP markers identified
    + In this study, Pi1, Pi2, and D12 were introgressed to improve the blast resistance of Jin 23B and its derived hybrids, Jinyou 402 and Jinyou 207, by marker-assisted selection (MAS)
    + Pi1, Pi2, and D12 showed a strong dosage effect on the resistance to blast in the hybrid background during the entire growth duration in the field condition, being very useful for breeding blast-resistant hybrids
