* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + PLS2 expression was detected in all tissues surveyed, but predominantly in leaf mesophyll cells
    + These data suggested that the PLS2 allele is essential for normal leaf senescence and its mutation resulted in PLS
    + The pls2 mutant accumulated higher levels of sucrose together with decreased expression of sucrose metabolizing genes compared with wild type
