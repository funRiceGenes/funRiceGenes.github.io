* **Key message**  
    + The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice.
    + Mutation of PANDA caused reduced panicle number but increased grain size in rice, while transgenic plants overexpressing this gene showed the opposite phenotypic change
    + Among the target genes, both OsMADS55 and OsEMF1 were negative regulators of panicle number but positive regulators of grain size, partly explaining the involvement of PANDA in balancing panicle number and grain size
    + Moreover, moderate overexpression of PANDA driven by its own promoter in the indica rice cultivar can increase grain yield
