* **Key message**  
    + Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice
    + In this report, we found the female gamete of W207-2 was normal, and its semi-sterility was unaffected by growth duration but was conditioned by a recessive nuclear gene whose action leads to pollen semi-sterility and anther indehiscence, and the gene was named as pss1 (pollen semi-sterile)
    + Fine mapping of pss1, a pollen semi-sterile gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Here, we describe a rice pollen semi-sterility1 (pss1) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (~40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (~50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence
    + Furthermore, PSS1 expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis
    + Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the pss1 mutant
    + PSS1 is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles
