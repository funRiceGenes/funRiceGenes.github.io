* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report the involvement of a PCK protein PFKB1 in chloroplast development by identification of a new rice mutant, revertible early yellowing Kitaake 2 [rey(k2)]
    + The Pfkb1 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and its protein is mainly targeted to the chloroplast and, in some cells, to the nucleus
    + Taken together, our study suggests that PFKB1 functions as a novel regulator indispensable for early chloroplast development, at least partly by regulating chloroplast-associated genes
