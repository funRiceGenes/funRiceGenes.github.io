    + Cooperative regulation of PBI1 and MAPKs controls WRKY45 transcription factor in rice immunity.
    + In addition, chitin-induced MAP kinase activation is required for WRKY45 activation and PBI1 degradation
    + PBI1 also interacts with WRKY45, a master transcriptional activator of rice immunity, and negatively regulates its activity
    + These data suggest that PBI1 suppresses WRKY45 activity when cells are in an unelicited state, and during chitin signaling, PUB44-mediated degradation of PBI1 leads to activation of WRKY45
