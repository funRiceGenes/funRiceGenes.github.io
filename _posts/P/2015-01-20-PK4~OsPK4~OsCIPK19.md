* **Key message**  
    + OsPK4 and OsPK7 proteins produced in Escherichia coli were able to phosphorylate themselves and myelin basic proteins, the reaction requiring magnesium and/or manganese ions
    + Diverse response of rice and maize genes encoding homologs of WPK4, an SNF1-related protein kinase from wheat, to light, nutrients, low temperature and cytokinins
    + The wheat gene WPK4 encodes a 56-kDa protein kinase that belongs to group 3 of the SNF1-related protein kinase family (SnRK3), and is up-regulated by light and cytokinins and down-regulated by sucrose
    + Transcripts of OsPK4 were detected in all tissues tested, and amounts were increased upon illumination, nutrient deprivation and treatment with cytokinins
