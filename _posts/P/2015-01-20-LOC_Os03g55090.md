* **Key message**  
    + The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure
    + These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures
    + The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent
    + Plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds
    + Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 pho1-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect
    + Our work suggests that regulation of PHO1 expression via its uORF might be a genetic resource useful-both in natural populations and in the context of genome editing-toward improving plant growth under Pi-deficient conditions
    + We further show that natural accessions lacking the PHO1 uORF exhibit higher PHO1 protein levels and shoot Pi content
    + Increased shoot Pi content was linked to the absence of the PHO1 uORF in a population of F2 segregants
    + In this work, we demonstrate that an upstream open reading frame (uORF) present in the 5' untranslated region of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHO1 inhibits its translation and influences Pi homeostasis
    + A point mutation removing the PHO1 uORF (<a6><a4>uORF) in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in increased association of its mRNA with polysomes and led to higher PHO1 protein levels, independent of Pi availability
    + Pho1 deficiency impaired MOS mobilization, triggering short MOS accumulation and starch synthesis reduction during early seed development
    + Pho1 cooperates with DPE1 to control short maltooligosaccharide mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.
    + These findings show that Pho1 cooperates with DPE1 to control short MOS mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm
