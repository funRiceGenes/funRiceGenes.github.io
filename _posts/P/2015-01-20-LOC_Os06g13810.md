* **Key message**  
    + However, mechanisms underlying the regulation of starch metabolism by PFP1 remain elusive
    + Map-based cloning revealed that pfp1-3 is a novel allele and encodes the regulatory β-subunit of PFP1 (PFP1β)
    + This study addressed the function of PFP1 in rice floury endosperm and defective grainfilling
    + Concentrations of multiple lipid and glycolytic intermediates and trehalose metabolites were elevated in pfp1-3 endosperm, indicating that PFP1 modulates endosperm metabolism, potentially through reversible adjustments to metabolic fluxes
