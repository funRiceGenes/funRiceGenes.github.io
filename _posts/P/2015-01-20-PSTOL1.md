## Genbank accession number
[BAK26566](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BAK26566)  

## Expression information
__Expression__: Here, we have reported the presence as well as the expression of a previously characterized rice gene, phosphate starvation tolerance locus PSTOL1 in a set of selected genotypes |  Thus, before considering PSTOL1 gene in MAB, its expression and role in P-deficiency tolerance in the donor parent must be ascertained  
__Expression__: Based on the co-localization with QTLs, the protein domain conservation and the coincidence of gene expression, we selected novel maize genes as putative homologs to PSTOL1 that will require further validation studies  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __yield__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
2. __root__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients
3. __phosphorus__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  However, its functional mechanism remained elusive until the locus was sequenced, showing the presence of a Pup1-specific protein kinase gene, which we have named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 PSTOL1)  
4. __phosphorus__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
5. __phosphorus__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients

7. __grain__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
8. __submergence__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D), " The absence of PSTOL1 and other genes-for example, the submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A-from modern rice varieties underlines the importance of conserving and exploring traditional germplasm"
9. __growth__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients
10. __grain yield__, [The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil
11. __tolerance__, [Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus PSTOL1 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus PSTOL1 in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Neither the presence of PSTOL1 gene nor its closely-linked SSR RM1261, showed any association with P-deficiency tolerance among the 108 genotypes
12. __tolerance__, [Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus PSTOL1 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus PSTOL1 in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Not only this, but the presence of PSTOL1 in recombinant inbred line RIL developed from a cross between Gobindabhog and Satabdi, also did not show any linkage with P-deficiency tolerance ability
