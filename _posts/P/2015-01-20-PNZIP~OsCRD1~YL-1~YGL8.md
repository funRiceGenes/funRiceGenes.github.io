* **Key message**  
    + 1 region were associated with the presence of one or more flowering time genes (GI, SOC1, FT-L8, EMF1, and PNZIP)
    + Under short-day lengths, lines with introgressions carrying combinations of linked flowering time genes (GI/SOC1, SOC1/FT-L8, GI/SOC1/FT-L8 and EMF1/PNZIP) from the late parent, O
    + rufipogon, flowered earlier than the recurrent parent, Jefferson, while recombinant lines carrying smaller introgressions marked by the presence of GI, SOC1, EMF1 or PNZIP alone no longer flowered early
    + Under long-day length, lines carrying SOC1/FT-L8, SOC1 or PNZIP flowered early, while those carrying GI or EMF1 delayed flowering
    + Map-based cloning and over-expression analysis suggested that YL-1 encodes a subunit of MPEC
    + Results of qRT-PCR showed that Chl biosynthesis upstream genes were highly expressed in the yl-1 mutant, while downstream genes were compromised, indicating that YL-1 plays a pivotal role in the Chl biosynthesis
