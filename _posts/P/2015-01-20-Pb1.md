* **Key message**  
    + Pb1 encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae races
    + Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a blast-resistance gene derived from the indica cultivar 'Modan'
    + Pb1-mediated resistance, which is characterized by durability of resistance and adult/panicle blast resistance, has been introduced into elite varieties for commercial cultivation
    + We discuss possible determinants for the durability of Pb1-mediated blast resistance
    + Durable panicle blast-resistance gene Pb1 encodes an atypical CC-NBS-LRR protein and was generated by acquiring a promoter through local genome duplication
    + Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a panicle blast resistance gene derived from the indica rice cultivar Modan
    + Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb1-mediated blast resistance
    + Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar
    + Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice
    + Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice
    + Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1
    + Overexpression of Pb1 with a nuclear export sequence failed to confer blast resistance to rice
    + These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus
    + In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance
    + Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction
    + Based on the cosegregation of the resistant genotypes of Pb1 and Stvb-i, a rice stripe virus (RSV) resistance gene derived from an Indica cultivar Modan, we examined the linkage relationships between Pb1 and 13 Stvb-i-linked RFLP markers located on the long arm of chromosome 11
    + Pb1 transcript levels increased during the development of Pb1+ cultivars; this expression pattern accounts for their adult/panicle resistance
    + The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system
    + We precisely mapped the Pb1 locus for the panicle blast resistence of a quantitative nature on rice chromosome 11 using RFLP markers
    + Identification of a RFLP Marker Tightly Linked to the Panicle Blast Resistance Gene, Pb1, in Rice
    + Pb1 is classified as a quantitative resistance gene and it does not have fungal specificity
    + Mapping of QTL related to Chr7 confirmed the existence of factors that were required for the resistance of Pb1 in the 22 to 23 Mbp region of the rice genome
    + We clarified how the K209 cultivar is vulnerable to the blast disease despite possessing Pb1 and found the DNA marker responsible for the quantitative resistance of Pb1
    + We found that the expression of WRKY45 gene downstream of Pb1 was weakly induced by rice blast inoculation at the full heading stage in K209
