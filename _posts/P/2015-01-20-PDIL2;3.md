    + [AK062254](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK062254)

* **Key message**  
    + Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.
    + The activation of PDIL2-3 in response to ER stress strongly depends on the IRE1-OsbZIP50 signaling pathway.

    + __CysR10~crP10__, __PDIL2;3__, [Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D), PDIL2;3 knockdown inhibited the accumulation of Cys-rich 10-kD prolamin (crP10) in the core of PB-I
    + __CysR10~crP10__, __PDIL2;3__, [Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D), Conversely, crP10 knockdown dispersed PDIL2;3 into the ER lumen
    + __CysR10~crP10__, __PDIL2;3__, [Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D), We discuss PDIL2;3-dependent and PDIL2;3-independent oxidation pathways that sustain disulfide bonds of crP10 in PB-I
