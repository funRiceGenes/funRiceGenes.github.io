    + __PLA2-I__, __PLA2-II__, [Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s PLA2s are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s PLA2s are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), These encode mature proteins of 119 amino acids (PLA2-I, preceded by a 19 amino acid signal peptide) and 128 amino acids (PLA2-II, preceded by a 25 amino acid signal peptide), and were derived from four expressed sequence tag (EST) clones
