## Connection
1. __PLA2-I__, __PLA2-II__, [Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  These encode mature proteins of 119 amino acids (PLA2-I, preceded by a 19 amino acid signal peptide) and 128 amino acids (PLA2-II, preceded by a 25 amino acid signal peptide), and were derived from four expressed sequence tag (EST) clones
2. __PLA2-I__, __PLA2-II__, [Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  This sequence was different from but homologous to the PLA2-I and PLA2-II sequences
