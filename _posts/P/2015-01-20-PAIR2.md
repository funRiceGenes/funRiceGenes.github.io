* **Key message**  
    + In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
    + In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
    + Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
    + Mature PAIR2 mRNA and several splicing variants were found to be highly expressed in wild-type reproductive tissues, and lower expression was also detected in vegetative tissues
    + We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
    + In situ hybridization and BrdU incorporation experiments revealed that PAIR2 expression is specifically enhanced in male and female meiocytes, but not in those at pre-meiotic S phase or in the pollen maturation stages
    + The PAIR2 gene is required for homologous chromosome synapsis at meiosis I in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + However, PAIR2 does not play a role in AE formation, sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres or kinetochore assembly in meiosis I of rice
    + PAIR2 is essential for homologous chromosome synapsis in rice meiosis I
    + Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
    + Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
    + To elucidate the genetic system that establishes homologous chromosome pairing in monocot plants, we have isolated an asynaptic mutant of rice, designated pair2 (homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 2), in which 24 completely unpaired univalents are observed at pachytene and diakinesis
    + The results obtained in this study suggest that the PAIR2 gene is essential for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis, as in the case of the genes ASY1 and HOP1
    + An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis
