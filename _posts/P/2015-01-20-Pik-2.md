* **Key message**  
    + To study similar, but distinct, plant disease resistance (R) specificities exhibited by allelic genes at the rice blast resistance locus Pik/Pikm, we cloned the Pik gene from rice cultivar Kanto51 and compared its molecular features with those of Pikm and of another Pik gene cloned from cv
    + Characterization of the rice blast resistance gene Pik cloned from Kanto51
    + Pik is a younger allele at the locus that probably emerged after rice domestication
    + The isolation and characterization of Pik, a rice blast resistance gene which emerged after rice domestication
    + The rice blast resistance gene Pik, which is one of the five classical alleles located at the Pik locus on the long arm of chromosome 11, confers high and stable resistance to many Chinese rice blast isolates
