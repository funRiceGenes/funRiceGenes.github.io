* **Key message**  
    + Both pps1 RNAi and heterozygous plants are characterized by delayed development and partial pollen sterility at vegetative stages and reproductive stage
    + In our recent study, we found that the knockout of rice PPS1 causes pleiotropic growth disorders, including growth retardation, dwarf and sterile pollen, and finally leads to impaired C-U RNA editing at five consecutive sites on the mitochondrial nad3
    + In this study, we further investigate the roles of PPS1 in abiotic stress tolerance, we confirmed that pss1-RNAi line exhibited enhanced sensitivity to salinity and ABA stress at vegetative stage, specifically
    + Silencing of rice PPR gene PPS1 exhibited enhanced sensibility to abiotic stress and remarkable accumulation of ROS
    + These results implied that PPS1 functioned on ROS signaling network to contribute for the flexibility to abiotic stresses
