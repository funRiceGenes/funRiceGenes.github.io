* **Key message**  
    + We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression
    + Here, we identify PIBP1 (PigmR-INTERACTING and BLAST RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1), an RRM (RNA-recognition motif) protein that specifically interacts with PigmR and other similar NLRs to trigger blast resistance
    + PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance
    + Knockout of PIBP1 and Os06 g02240 greatly attenuated blast resistance
