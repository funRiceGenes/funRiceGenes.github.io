* **Key message**  
    + Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms
    + The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide

    + Transcriptome Analysis Highlights Defense and Signaling Pathways Mediated by Rice pi21 Gene with Partial Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.
    + The pi21 gene confers partial and durable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae
    + However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of resistance mediated by the loss-of-function of Pi21
    + This study highlights possible candidate genes that may serve a function in the partial rice blast resistance mediated by the loss-of-function of Pi21 and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in partial resistance against M
