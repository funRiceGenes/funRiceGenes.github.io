## Key message
1. __meristem__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D),  A supershift assay using an anti-PCF2 antibody showed the involvement of PCF2 in site IIa site IIb binding activities in rice nuclear extracts, particularly in meristematic tissues
2. __meristem__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers

## Connection
1. __PCF1__, __PCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D),  The two DNA binding proteins, designated PCF1 and PCF2, share > 70% homology in common conserved sequences at the N-terminal regions
2. __PCF1__, __PCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D),  The motif is > 70% homologous to several expressed sequence tags from Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that PCF1 and PCF2 are members of a novel family of proteins that are conserved in monocotyledons and dicotyledons
3. __PCF1__, __PCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D),  PCF1 and PCF2 were also more likely to form heterodimers than homodimers
4. __PCF1__, __PCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers
