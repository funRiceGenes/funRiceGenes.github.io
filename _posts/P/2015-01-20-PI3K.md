* **Key message**  
    + Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses
    + In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity
    + Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination
    + Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination
