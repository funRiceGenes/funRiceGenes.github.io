## Key message
1. __growth__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)), Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses
2. __seed germination__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity
3. __seed germination__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)),  Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination
4. __seed germination__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination
5. __seed__, [Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity
