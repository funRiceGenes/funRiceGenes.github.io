* **Key message**  
    + Using Ecotype Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (EcoTILLING) and TILLING as forward genetic tools, we identified the causative mutation of an EMS mutant characterized by excessive tillering, semi-dwarfism and leaf variegation that corresponded to the PTOX1 gene
    + The tillering and semi-dwarf phenotypes of the ptox1 mutant are similar to phenotypes of known strigolactone (SL)-related rice mutants, and both phenotypic traits could be rescued by application of the synthetic SL GR24
    + The ptox1 mutant accumulated phytoene in white leaf sectors with a corresponding deficiency in beta-carotene, consistent with the expected function of PTOX1 in promoting phytoene desaturase activity
