* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [D50556](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/D50556)

* **Key message**  
    + We found that OsNLP4 transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice
    + We further constructed quadrupling NREs (Nitrate-responsive cis-element) in the promoter of OsNiR (p4xNRE:OsNiR) and enhanced nitrogen assimilation significantly
