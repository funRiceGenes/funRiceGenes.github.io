* **Key message**  
    + In the roots of pez1, precipitated apoplasmic iron increased
    + The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele
    + We show that PEZ1 is responsible for an increase of PCA concentration in the xylem sap and is essential for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated iron in the stele
    + Recently, we isolated and characterized a phenolics efflux transporter in rice by characterizing a mutant in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced, which we hence named phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1)
    + We identified a cadmium-accumulating rice mutant in which the amount of PCA and caffeic acid in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced and hence named it phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1)
    + PEZ1 localized mainly in the stele of roots
