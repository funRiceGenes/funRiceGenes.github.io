## Key message
1. __seed__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
2. __homeostasis__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis
3. __leaf__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 PLA3/GOLIATH GO that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation the plastochron)  
4. __leaf__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
5. __leaf__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
6. __shoot__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
7. __reproductive__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
