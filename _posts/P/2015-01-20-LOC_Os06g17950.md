* **Key message**  
    + Introduction of Pid4 into susceptible rice cultivars confers race-specific resistance to leaf and neck blast
    + Identification and characterization of rice blast resistance gene Pid4 by a combination of transcriptomic profiling and genome analysis.
    + Amino acid sequence comparison and blast resistance spectrum tests showed that Pid4 is a novel R gene, different from the previously reported R genes located in the same gene cluster
    + Here, we reported the isolation of blast R gene Pid4 using comparative transcriptomic profiling and genome-wide sequence analysis
    + The Pid4 protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
