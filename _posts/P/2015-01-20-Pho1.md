* **Key message**  
    + The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure
    + These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures
    + The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent
    + Plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds
    + Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 pho1-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect
