## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation
2. __domestication__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Sequence comparison shows that 182 varieties of cultivated rice, including 87 indica and 95 japonica cultivars from 17 countries, carry identical mutations in the prog1 coding region that may have become fixed during rice domestication
3. __domestication__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice
4. __tiller__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers
5. __tiller__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation
6. __growth__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi-dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys(2)-His(2) zinc-finger protein
7. __growth__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
8. __grain__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
9. __tiller angle__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers
10. __erect__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
11. __grain yield__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
12. __axillary meristem__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation
13. __prostrate__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi-dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys(2)-His(2) zinc-finger protein
14. __yield__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
15. __grain number__, [Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice
16. __architecture__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers
17. __architecture__, [Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice
