* **Key message**  
    + LC-MS/MS revealed that PDD is associated with the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification of chloroplast tRNA
    + Map-based cloning revealed that PDD encodes an evolutionarily conserved tRNA-modifying GTPase belonging to the TrmE family
    + Rice TCD8 Encoding a Multi-Domain GTPase Is Crucial for Chloroplast Development of Early Leaf Stage at Low Temperatures.
    + In addition, the disturbance of TCD8 suppressed the transcripts of certain chloroplast-related genes at low temperature, although the genes were recoverable to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32 Â°C), indicating that TCD8 governs chloroplast development at low temperature
    + Map-based cloning and complementary test revealed the TCD8 encoded a multi-domain GTPase localized in chloroplasts
