* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + LC-MS/MS revealed that PDD is associated with the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification of chloroplast tRNA
    + Map-based cloning revealed that PDD encodes an evolutionarily conserved tRNA-modifying GTPase belonging to the TrmE family
