* **Key message**  
    + PACP is involved in the recruitment or stabilization of PRC2 to genes targeted by KNOX/BELL transcription factors to maintain H3K27me3 and gene repression in dividing cells of the shoot apex
    + We show that PACP is required for the repression of cell differentiation-promoting genes targeted by a rice KNOX1 protein in the shoot apical meristem
