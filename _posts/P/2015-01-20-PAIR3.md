## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
2. __meiosis__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR3 HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in rice
3. __meiosis__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
4. __meiosis__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Our results suggest that PAIR3 plays a crucial role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in meiosis
5. __meiosis__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D), Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis
6. __sterility__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Two independent alleles, designated pair3-1 and pair3-2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes
7. __pollen__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
8. __reproductive__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
