* **Key message**  
    + Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.
    + We characterized a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus; Pi50 is derived from functional divergence of duplicated genes
    + The unique features of Pi50 should facilitate its use in rice breeding and improve our understanding of the evolution of resistance specificities
    + Complementation tests and resistance spectrum analyses revealed that Pi50_NBS4_1/2, not Pi50_NBS4_3/4, control the novel resistance specificity as observed in the Pi50 near isogenic line, NIL-e1
    + The identification of Pi50 with its novel resistance specificity will facilitate the dissection of mechanisms behind the divergence and evolution of different resistance specificities at the Pi2/9 locus
    + Pi50 shares greater than 96 % amino acid sequence identity with each of three other R proteins, i
