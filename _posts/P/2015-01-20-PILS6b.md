* **Key message**  
    + OsSPL14 acts upstream of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to modulate axillary bud outgrowth by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice.
    + Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 can control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice
    + Loss of function of OsPIN1b or PILS6b increased the tiller number of rice
