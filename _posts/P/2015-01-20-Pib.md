* **Key message**  
    + The deduced amino acid sequence of the Pib gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); thus, Pib is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease resistance genes
    + The Pib gene for rice blast resistance belongs to the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes
    + Development of pyramided lines with two resistance genes, Pish and Pib, for blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Pib, one of the rice blast resistance genes
    + We report the development of pyramided lines with two major blast resistance genes, Pish and Pib, and the evaluation of the combining effect of them
    + The two genes pyramided lines were selected from the progenies of a cross between one near isogenic line (NIL), which harbours Pish, and another NIL, which harbours Pib, in the genetic background of blast susceptible variety, CO 39
    + We confirmed the additive effect of Pish and Pib in the pyramided lines by their reaction patterns to blast isolates, suggesting the potential availabilities of the combinations of these genes
    + Pib gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness
    + The rice blast resistance gene Pib confers broad-spectrum resistance against Southeast Asian M
    + Together, the new Pib alleles are an important genetic resource for rice blast resistance breeding programs and provide new information on rice-M
