6. __blast__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D),  The heterozygous ospal4 mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility to three distinct rice diseases, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast

8. __blight__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D),  OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2

10. __resistance__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D),  OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
