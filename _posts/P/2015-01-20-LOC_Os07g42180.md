* **Key message**  
    + Examining intronless tRNA-Tyr and intron-containing pre-tRNA-Ala expression levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction with Northern blot analysis between wild-type and mutant leaf tissue suggested that rice PSD might be involved in tRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
    + In this study, we verified a rice transfer-DNAinsertional mutant psd line and analyzed its phenotypes; the mutant displayed severe morphological defects including retarded development and low fertility compared with wild-type rice
