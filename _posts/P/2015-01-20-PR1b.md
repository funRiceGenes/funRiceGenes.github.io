    + [Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Physiol Mol Biol Plants.

* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
