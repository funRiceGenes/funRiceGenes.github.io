## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Expression and characterization of rice putativePAUSEDgene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression and characterization of rice putativePAUSEDgene%5BTitle%5D)),  Examining intronless tRNA-Tyr and intron-containing pre-tRNA-Ala expression levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction with Northern blot analysis between wild-type and mutant leaf tissue suggested that rice PSD might be involved in tRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
2. __fertility__, [Expression and characterization of rice putativePAUSEDgene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression and characterization of rice putativePAUSEDgene%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we verified a rice transfer-DNAinsertional mutant psd line and analyzed its phenotypes; the mutant displayed severe morphological defects including retarded development and low fertility compared with wild-type rice
