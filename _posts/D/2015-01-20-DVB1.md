* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that DVB1 encodes a structural protein classified in the Mic10 family and is required for the formation of cristae in mitochondria, and was primarily expressed in vascular bundles
    + Comparing with the wild type, disruption of amino acid metabolism and increased auxin synthesis were observed in dvb1 mutant which also showed increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors
    + Further studies indicated that DVB1 is important for mitochondrial and plant development in rice
    + The DVB1 protein is partially localized in the mitochondria and capable of forming dimers and polymers
    + CONCLUSIONS: DVB1 belongs to Mic10 family and DVB1 is partially localized in the mitochondria
