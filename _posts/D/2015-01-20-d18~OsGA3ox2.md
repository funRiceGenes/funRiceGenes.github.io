* **Key message**  
    + To confirm the functions of GA in rice, I used dwarf mutant d18-dy
    + In addition, d18-dy mutation and GA did not affect expression levels of downstream genes of miR156
    + d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and nodeâ€“internode differentiation in stem
    + We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
    + Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
    + These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation
    + BR greatly induces the expression of D18/GA3ox-2, one of the GA biosynthetic genes, leading to increased GA1 levels, the bioactive GA in rice seedlings.
