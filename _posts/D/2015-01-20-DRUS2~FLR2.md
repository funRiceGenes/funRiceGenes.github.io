* **Key message**  
    + A drus1-1 drus2 double knockout mutant, but not either single mutant, showed extreme dwarfism and barren inflorescences that harbored sterile spikelets
    + We observed that both FLR1 and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels
    + Interestingly, FLR1 and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and FLR1 might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development
    + In this study, we generated flr1 and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield
    + With these similar but different functions, we suggest that FLR1 and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice
