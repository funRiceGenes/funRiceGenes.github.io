* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report a GRAS protein DHD1 (Delayed Heading Date1) delays heading and enhances yield in rice
    + DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D located in the nucleus and showed that rhythmic expression
    + Both DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D affect heading date by regulating expression of Ehd1
    + We propose that DHD1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D to delay heading date by inhibiting expression of Ehd1
