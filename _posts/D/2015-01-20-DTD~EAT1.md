* **Key message**  
    + eat1 exhibits delayed tapetal cell death and aborted pollen formation
    + EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice
    + A novel rice bHLH transcription factor, DTD, acts coordinately with TDR in controlling tapetum function and pollen development
    + EAT1 transcription factor, a non-cell-autonomous regulator of pollen production, activates meiotic small RNA biogenesis in rice anther tapetum.
    + This study indicates that EAT1 is one of key regulators triggering meiotic phasiRNA biogenesis in anther tapetum, and that other bHLH proteins, TIP2 and UDT1, also play some important roles in this process
    + In this study, EAT1-dependent non-cell-autonomous regulation of male meiosis was evidenced from microscopic observation of the eat1 mutant, in which meiosis with aberrantly decondensed chromosomes was retarded but accomplished somehow, eventually resulting in abortive microspores due to an aberrant tapetal PCD
    + EAT1 protein accumulated in tapetal-cell nuclei at early meiosis and postmeiotic microspore stages
    + The transient assay also demonstrated that UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (UDT1)/bHLH164 is a potential interacting partner of both EAT1 and TIP2 during early meiosis
    + Meiotic EAT1 promoted transcription of 24-PHAS RNAs at 101 loci, and importantly, also activated DICER-LIKE5 (DCL5, previous DCL3b in rice) mRNA transcription that is required for processing of double-stranded 24-PHASs into 24-nt lengths
    + UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development
