* **Key message**  
    + Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and CYP724B1/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis
    + The gene was found to encode a novel cytochrome P450 (CYP724B1), which showed homology to enzymes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis
    + Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in d11 mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants
    + However, 6-deoxotyphasterol (6-DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in d11 mutants in a lamina joint bending assay
    + Multiple lines of evidence together suggest that the D11/CYP724B1 gene plays a role in BR synthesis and may be involved in the supply of 6-DeoxoTY and TY in the BR biosynthesis network in rice
    + Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
    + Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
    + We have characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf11 (d11), that bears seeds of reduced length
    + To understand the mechanism by which seed length is regulated, the D11 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning method
    + The dwarf phenotype of d11 mutants was restored by the application of the brassinolide (BL)
    + Overexpression of CPB1/D11 under the background of cpb1 mutant not only rescued normal panicle architecture and plant height, but also had a larger leaf angle and seed size than the controls
    + Genetic transformation experiments confirmed that a His360Leu amino acid substitution residing in the highly conserved region of CPB1/D11 was responsible for the panicle architecture and seed size changes in the cpb1 mutants
    + Overexpression of GNS4 significantly increased organ size, 1000-grain weight, and panicle size, and subsequently enhanced grain yields in both the Nipponbare and Wuyunjing7 (a high-yielding cultivar) backgrounds
    + A single nucleotide polymorphism (deletion) in the promoter region of GNS4 reduced its expression level in the mutant, leading to reduced grain number and smaller grains
    + Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that GNS4 positively regulates grain size by promoting cell elongation
    + GNS4 was identified as a positive regulator of grain number and grain size in rice
    + We characterized a rice mutant gns4 (grain number and size on chromosome 4) with reduced organ size, fewer grains per panicle, and smaller grains compared with those of WT
    + Map-based cloning indicated that the GNS4 gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 protein, is a novel allele of DWARF11 (D11)
    + These results suggest that GNS4 is key target gene with possible applications in rice yield breeding
    + GNS4 can be targeted in breeding programs to increase yields
    + Overall, it can be concluded that PMM1 is an important gene involved in BRs biosynthesis and affecting the differentiation of spikelet primordia and patterns of panicle branches in rice
    + Overexpression of D4 could successfully rescue the abnormal panicle architecture of pmm1 plants, indicating that PMM1/D11 and D4 function redundantly in BRs biosynthesis
    + PMM1 is a new allele of DWARF11 (D11) PMM1 transcripts are preferentially expressed in young panicles, particularly expressed in the primordia of branches and spikelets during inflorescence development
    + Map-based cloning revealed that a large fragment deletion from the 2nd to 9th exons of PMM1 was responsible for the clustered primary branch morphology in pmm1-1
    + Thus, our results demonstrated that PMM1 determines the inflorescence architecture by controlling brassinosteroid biosynthesis in rice
