* **Key message**  
    + Mutants defective in DTC1 exhibit phenotypes of an enlarged tapetum and middle layer with delayed degeneration, causing male sterility
    + Whereas wild-type plants accumulate large amounts of ROS in their anthers at Stage 9 of development, those levels remain low during all stages of development in dtc1 anthers
    + These results suggest that DTC1 functions downstream of those transcription factor genes and upstream of the genes encoding secretory proteins
    + These findings indicate that DTC1 is a key regulator for tapetum PCD by inhibiting ROS-scavenging activity
    + In dtc1 anthers, expression of genes encoding secretory proteases or lipid transporters is significantly reduced, while transcripts of PCD regulatory genes, e
