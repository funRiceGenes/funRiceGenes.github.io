* **Key message**  
    + Previously, we reported that parenchyma cells in the elongated internodes of d50 ectopically deposit cell wall phenolics
    + The d50 mutation induced abnormally oriented cell division, irregular deposition of cell wall pectins and thick actin bundles in the parenchyma cells of the IM, resulting in abnormally organized cell files of the internode parenchyma and dwarf phenotype
    + Our results suggest that the putative 5PTase, encoded by D50, is essential for IM formation, including the direction of cell division, deposition of cell wall pectins and control of actin organization
    + To understand the regulation of internode development, we analysed a rice dwarf mutant, dwarf 50 (d50)
    + DWARF50 (D50), a rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene encoding inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, is required for proper development of intercalary meristem
