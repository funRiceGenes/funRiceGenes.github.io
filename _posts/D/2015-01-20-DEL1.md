* **Key message**  
    + Our research indicates that DEL1 is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence
    + In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function and senescence related gene expression was altered in del1 plants
    + Functional analysis revealed that mutation of DEL1 decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan and altered the cell wall composition and structure
    + Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in del1 was affected by the cell cycle
