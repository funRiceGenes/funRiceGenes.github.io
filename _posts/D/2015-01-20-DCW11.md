* **Key message**  
    + NIMA-related kinase) and DCW11 encoding a mitochondrial putative protein phosphatase 2C were found in our previous microarray study as down-regulated genes in the rice CW-CMS line, which lacked pollen germination ability
    + These results suggest that OsNek3 is downstream of DCW11 in retrograde signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is involved in CW-CMS
    + Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, OsNek3, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, DCW11
    + DCW11 mRNA was preferentially expressed in anthers, with the highest expression in mature pollen
    + Knockdown of DCW11 in wild-type rice by RNA interference caused a major loss of seed-set fertility, without visible defect in pollen development
    + Our result indicates that DCW11 could play a role as a mitochondrial signal transduction mediator in pollen germination
    + As predicted by the N-terminal sequence, DCW11 signal peptide-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in mitochondria
    + This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines
    + DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility
