* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
    + These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis
    + Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1)
