* **Publication**  
    + [The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.%5BTitle%5D), 2017, Plant Cell.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
    + DRUS1 and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion
