* **Key message**  
    + Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice
    + Moreover, the non-elongating internodes of dwt1 are insensitive to exogenous gibberellin (GA) treatment, and some of the slender rice1 (slr1) dwt1 double mutant exhibits defective internodes similar to the dwt1 single mutant, suggesting that the DWT1 activity in the internode elongation is directly or indirectly associated with GA signaling.
    + The DWT1 gene is highly expressed in young panicles, but undetectable in the internodes, suggesting that DWT1 expression is spatially or temporally separated from its effect on the internode growth.

    + __DWT1__, __OsPIP5K1__, [DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Cytological analyses confirmed that DWT1 induces accumulation of OsPIP5K1 and its product PI(4,5)P2 , a phosphoinositide secondary messenger, in nuclear bodies
    + __DWT1__, __OsPIP5K1__, [DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance
    + __DWT1__, __OsPIP5K1__, [DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Conversely, overexpression of OsPIP5K1 partially rescues dwt1 developmental defects
