## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice%5BTitle%5D), Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice
2. __growth__, [Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice%5BTitle%5D), Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice
3. __transcription factor__, [Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice%5BTitle%5D), Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice
4. __GA__, [Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice%5BTitle%5D), Moreover, the non-elongating internodes of dwt1 are insensitive to exogenous gibberellin GA treatment, and some of the slender rice1 slr1 dwt1 double mutant exhibits defective internodes similar to the dwt1 single mutant, suggesting that the DWT1 activity in the internode elongation is directly or indirectly associated with GA signaling.
5. __panicle__, [Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice%5BTitle%5D), The DWT1 gene is highly expressed in young panicles, but undetectable in the internodes, suggesting that DWT1 expression is spatially or temporally separated from its effect on the internode growth.
