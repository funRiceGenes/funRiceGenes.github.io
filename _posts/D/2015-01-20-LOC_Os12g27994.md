* **Key message**  
    + Expression analysis showed that several type-A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway were downregulated in the dec mutant
    + Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway
    + In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
    + In addition, dec seedlings showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous CK
    + The dec mutants had an enlarged SAM with enhanced cell division activity
