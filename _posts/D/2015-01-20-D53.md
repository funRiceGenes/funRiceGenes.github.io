## Key message
1. __strigolactone__, [D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D), D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling
2. __growth__, [D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D),  We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth
3. __dwarf__, [DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice Oryza sativa mutant dwarf 53 d53 and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCFD3 ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling
4. __dwarf__, [D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that DWARF 53 D53 acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs induce its degradation
5. __dwarf__, [D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D),  The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the alpha/beta hydrolase protein DWARF 14 D14 and the F-box protein DWARF 3 D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception
6. __tiller__, [D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=D14-SCFD3-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D),  We find that the rice Oryza sativa d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment
7. __resistant__, [DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice%5BTitle%5D), " Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation"
