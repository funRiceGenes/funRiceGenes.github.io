* **Key message**  
    + Repression of DSH1 expression by the antisense gene or RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a severe reduction of fertility
    + A rice dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase (DSH1) gene, which is abundantly expressed in the stigmas, vascular cells and apical meristem, may be involved in fertility
    + Our results indicate that the product of DSH1 may be involved in plant viability or reproductive processes, and that the phenotype of sterility is apparently caused by loss of function of DSH1 in the stigma
    + The DSH1 gene was specifically and abundantly expressed in vascular bundles and apical meristems
