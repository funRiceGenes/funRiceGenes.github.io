* **Publication**  
    + [DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Importantly, we found that DGP1 interacts with the rice proteins GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (OsGLK2), the two transcription factors involved in the regulation of photosynthesis
    + Our results demonstrate that DGP1 is a repressor of OsGLK activity and thus photosynthesis in rice
    + We identified the dgp1 mutant, which has increased chlorophyll content in glumes
