* **Key message**  
    + The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets
    + DN1 is allelic to DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1 (DEP1) (=qPE(9-1))
    + Recently, qPE9-1 has been successfully cloned; however, the genetic effect on grain yield per plant of the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 is controversial yet
    + The comparison of agronomic traits between the NILs showed that, when qpe9-1 was replaced by qPE9-1, the panicle architecture was changed from drooping to erect; moreover, the panicle length, plant height, 1000-grain weight and the tillers were significantly decreased, consequently resulting in the dramatic decrease of grain yield per plant by 30%
    + Therefore, we concluded that the qPE9-1 was a major factor controlling panicle architecture, and qPE9-1 had pleiotropic nature, with negative effects on grain yield per plant
    + Introgression of qPE9-1 allele, conferring the panicle erectness, leads to the decrease of grain yield per plant in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    + The qPE9-1 gene has been proved to be widely used in high-yield rice cultivar developments, conferring erect panicle character in japonica rice
    + In the present study, a drooping panicle parent Nongken 57, carrying qpe9-1 allele, was used as recurrent parent to successively backcross to a typical erect panicle line from the double haploid (DH) population (Wuyunjing 8/Nongken 57), which was previously shown to carry qPE9-1 allele
    + This result strongly suggests that the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 should be used together with other favorable genes in the high-yield breeding practice
    + A comparison of the Dn1-1 and Dn1-3 alleles suggests that the N-terminal region of DN1 contains a coiled-coil domain and a nuclear localization signal that might be responsible for semi-dwarfness
    + A rice cDNA, OsDEP1, encoding a highly cysteine (Cys)-rich G protein gamma subunit, was initially identified as it conferred cadmium (Cd) tolerance on yeast cells
    + Rice DEP1, encoding a highly cysteine-rich G protein gamma subunit, confers cadmium tolerance on yeast cells and plants
    + Natural variation at the DEP1 locus enhances grain yield in rice
    + In addition, the qPE9-1 locus regulates panicle and grain length, grain weight, and consequently grain yield
    + Dn1-1 plants have normal sensitivity to gibberellin, brassinolide, and kinetin, and we observed no genetic epistasis with brassinolide-related mutants, suggesting that DN1 does not function in the signaling pathways of these phytohormones
    + Here we report the map-based cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, qPE9-1, which plays an integral role in regulation of rice plant architecture including panicle erectness
    + Phenotypic comparisons of a set of near-isogenic lines and transgenic lines reveal that the functional allele (qPE9-1) results in drooping panicles, and the loss-of-function mutation (qpe9-1) leads to more erect panicles
    + We propose that the panicle erectness trait resulted from a natural random loss-of-function mutation for the qPE9-1 gene and has subsequently been the target of artificial selection during japonica rice breeding
    + Deletion in a quantitative trait gene qPE9-1 associated with panicle erectness improves plant architecture during rice domestication
    + In addition, we found that H90, the nearest marker to qPE9-1, used for genotyping 38 cultivars with extremely erect and drooping panicles, segregated in agreement with PC, suggesting the H90 product was possibly part of the qPE9-1 gene or closely related to it
    + We show that the rice DENSE PANICLE 1 (DN1) mutant allele Dn1-1 causes both of these characteristics and that Dn1-1 is a loss-of-function mutation
    + These data demonstrated that H90 could be used for marker-aided selection for the PE trait in breeding and in the cloning of qPE9-1
    + In order to improve the genetic diversity of DEP1, we used a rice germplasm collection of 72 high yielding japonica rice varieties to analyze the contribution of DEP1 to the panicle traits
    + The SNP (G/C) at the promoter region will contribute to the flexible application of DEP1 in rice breeding
    + DEP1 is a G protein gamma subunit that is involved in the regulation of erect panicle, number of grains per panicle, nitrogen uptake, and stress-tolerance through the G protein signal pathway
    + Here we review the development of erect panicle rice varieties, DEP1 alleles and regulatory network, and its physiological and morphological functions
    + Additionally, the further increasing the yield potential of erect-panicle super-rice, and the development of molecular designing breeding for indica-japonica hybrid rice with the dep1 gene are also prospected
