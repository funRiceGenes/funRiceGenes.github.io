* **Key message**  
    + Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice
    + Real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and promoter activity assays showed that the d-h gene was primarily expressed in the nodes and the panicle
    + Since the mutant plants exhibit a defect in GA response, but not in the GA synthetic pathway, it appears that the d-h gene may be involved in a GA signaling pathway
