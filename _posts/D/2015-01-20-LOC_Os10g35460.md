* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + DROT1 is specifically expressed in vascular bundles and is directly repressed by ERF3 and activated by ERF71, both drought-responsive transcription factors
    + DROT1 improves drought resistance by adjusting cell wall structure by increasing cellulose content and maintaining cellulose crystallinity
    + A C-to-T single-nucleotide variation in the promoter increases DROT1 expression and drought resistance in upland rice
    + Natural variation of DROT1 confers drought adaptation in upland rice.
