* **Key message**  
    + Here, we clone and characterize DST (drought and salt tolerance)-a previously unknown zinc finger transcription factor that negatively regulates stomatal closure by direct modulation of genes related to H(2)O(2) homeostasis-and identify a novel pathway for the signal transduction of DST-mediated H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure
    + Loss of DST function increases stomatal closure and reduces stomatal density, consequently resulting in enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice
    + A previously unknown zinc finger protein, DST, regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice via stomatal aperture control
    + We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number
    + Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the reproductive meristem
    + Our study reveals that, as a unique regulator of reproductive meristem activity, DST may be explored to facilitate the genetic enhancement of grain production in rice and other small grain cereals
    + Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production
    + Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression
    + DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs
    + The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST
    + Expression of DST, a reported zinc finger gene negatively regulating H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure, and the activity of H(2)O(2)-scavenging related enzymes were significantly suppressed, and H(2)O(2) in guard cells was accumulated in the overexpression lines
    + Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice
    + Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.
    + Phenotypic analyses revealed that OsMED25-RNAi and the osmed25 mutant plants exhibited enlarged panicles, with enhanced branching and spikelet number, similar to the dst mutant
    + Thus, OsMED25 was involved in the communication between DST and Pol II general transcriptional machinery to regulate spikelet number
    + Interestingly, we found that WL1 negatively regulated the expression of a narrow leaf gene, NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), by recruiting the co-repressor TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN and directly binding to the NAL1 regulatory region to inhibit its expression by reducing the chromatin histone acetylation
    + WL1 encodes a Cys-2/His-2-type (C2H2) zinc finger protein that interacts with Tillering and Dwarf 1 (TAD1), a co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (a multi-subunit E3 ligase)
