* **Key message**  
    + Thus, DPW2 plays a fundamental role in pollen development via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and pollen wall
    + Compared with the wild type (WT), dpw2 anthers have increased amounts of cutin and waxes and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds
