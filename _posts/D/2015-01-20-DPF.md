[Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Plant J.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Expressions of all DP biosynthetic genes and accumulation of MLs and PCs were remarkably increased and decreased in DPF overexpressing and DPF-knockdown rice, respectively  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __blast__, [Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  DPF is expressed mainly in roots and panicles, and is inducible in leaves by blast infection, copper chloride, or UV
2. __copper__, [Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  DPF is expressed mainly in roots and panicles, and is inducible in leaves by blast infection, copper chloride, or UV

## Connection
1. __CYP99A2__, __DPF__, [Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, DPF partly regulates CYP99A2 through the N-box
2. __DPF__, __OsCPS2~OsCyc2__, [Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice%5BTitle%5D), Furthermore, DPF activated the promoters of COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 (CPS2) and CYTOCHROME P450 MONOOXIGENASE (CYP) 99A2, which are implicated in the biosynthesis of PCs and MLs, respectively.
