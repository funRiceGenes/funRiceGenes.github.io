* **Key message**  
    + Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages
    + Peroxidase activity, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine staining revealed that the dsm1 mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress due to an increase in ROS damage caused by the reduced POX activity
    + Overexpression of DSM1 in rice increased the tolerance to dehydration stress at the seedling stage
    + A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice
    + By real-time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold
    + We identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant (drought-hypersensitive mutant1 [dsm1]) of a putative MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) gene in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + The dsm1 mutants lost water more rapidly than wild-type plants under drought stress, which was in agreement with the increased drought-sensitivity phenotype of the mutant plants
    + DSM1-RNA interference lines were also hypersensitive to drought stress
    + Together, these results suggest that DSM1 might be a novel MAPKKK functioning as an early signaling component in regulating responses to drought stress by regulating scavenging of ROS in rice
