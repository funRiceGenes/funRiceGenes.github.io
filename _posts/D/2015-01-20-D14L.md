* **Key message**  
    + D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia
    + After 6<U+00A0>wk post-inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis, root developmental responses, fungal colonization and transcriptional responses were monitored in two independent cerk1 null mutants; a deletion mutant lacking D14L, and with D14L complemented as well as their respective wild-type cultivars (cv Nipponbare and Nihonmasari)
    + Here we show that although essential for symbiosis, D14L is dispensable for AMF-induced root architectural modulation, which conversely relies on CERK1

* **Connection**  
    + __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth
    + __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D), This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation
    + __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D), Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively
