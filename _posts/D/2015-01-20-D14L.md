* **Key message**  
    + D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia
    + After 6<U+00A0>wk post-inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis, root developmental responses, fungal colonization and transcriptional responses were monitored in two independent cerk1 null mutants; a deletion mutant lacking D14L, and with D14L complemented as well as their respective wild-type cultivars (cv Nipponbare and Nihonmasari)
    + Here we show that although essential for symbiosis, D14L is dispensable for AMF-induced root architectural modulation, which conversely relies on CERK1

    + __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth
    + __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D), This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation
    + __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D), Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively
    + __D14L__, __OsSMAX1__, [Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness %5BTitle%5D),  We demonstrate that D14L recognizes the karrikin signal and recruits the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSMAX1, mirroring the SL-induced and D14- and D3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of D53
    + __D14L__, __OsSMAX1__, [Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness %5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of OsSMAX1 promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of OsSMAX1 suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of d14l and d3 but had little effect on their shoot branching phenotype
