* **Key message**  
    + We present here the functional identification of DPE1 in storage starch synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules
    + Changes in DPE1 gene expression also resulted in modifications in the thermal and pasting features of endosperm starch granules
    + These findings demonstrate that DPE1 participates substantially in starch synthesis in rice endosperm by transferring maltooligosyl groups from amylose and amylopectin to amylopectin
