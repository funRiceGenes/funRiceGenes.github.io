## Expression information
__Expression__: DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules |  Changes in DPE1 gene expression also resulted in modifications in the thermal and pasting features of endosperm starch granules  
__OverExpression__: DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules  
__RNAi__:
