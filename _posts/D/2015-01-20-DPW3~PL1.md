* **Key message**  
    + DPW3 is ubiquitously expressed in anther developmental stages and its protein is localized to plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi
    + pl1 exhibited smaller anthers with arrested pollen development, absent Ubisch bodies, necrosis-like tapetal hypertrophy, and smooth anther cuticular surface
    + PL1 is highly expressed in the tapetal cells of developing anther, and its protein is co-localized with plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal
