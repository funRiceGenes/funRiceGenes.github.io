* **Publication**  
    + [DSH5, a dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase gene family member, shows spatially restricted expression in rice and is lethal when expressed ectopically.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DSH5, a dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase gene family member, shows spatially restricted expression in rice and is lethal when expressed ectopically.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, Genes Genet Syst.

* **Key message**  
    + Ectopic expression of DSH5 induced a dwarf phenotype characterized by severe growth inhibition and an increase in the thickness of the leaf body caused by enlargement of bulliform cells in the leaves
    + DSH5 expression was specifically in vascular bundle tissues

* **Connection**  
    + __DSH1__, __DSH5__, [DSH5, a dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase gene family member, shows spatially restricted expression in rice and is lethal when expressed ectopically.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DSH5, a dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase gene family member, shows spatially restricted expression in rice and is lethal when expressed ectopically.%5BTitle%5D),  Rice has two types of DSH homologs: general DSHs, namely DSH1, DSH2 and DSH4, and others that show spatial expression profiles, namely DSH3 and DSH5
