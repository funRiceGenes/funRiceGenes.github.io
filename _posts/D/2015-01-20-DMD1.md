* **Key message**  
    + DMD1 interacts with Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for exine formation
    + DMD1 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores during postmeiotic development
    + Taken together, our results suggest that DMD1 is responsible for microspore cell integrity, primexine formation, and exine pattern formation during rice microspore development
    + Mutations in DMD1 cause a male sterile phenotype with impaired microspore cell integrity
