* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR
    + In addition to the dwarf phenotype, dgl1 produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions
    + GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced
    + The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant
    + Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule-severing function of DGL1 may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR-deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization
    + We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
    + These results suggest that the function of DGL1 is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant DGL1-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling
