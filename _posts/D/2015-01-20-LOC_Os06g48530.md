* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning showed that Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein
    + Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.
    + Moreover, Du13 also regulates alternative splicing of other protein-coding transcripts and affects the biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs
    + Du13 coordinates with the nuclear cap-binding complex to regulate the splicing of Wx(b) transcripts in rice endosperm
    + Loss of TL1 function reduced apparent amylose content (AAC), total starch, gel consistency, and gelatinisation temperature, whereas increased viscosity, total lipid, and ratio of amylopectin A chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 6-12 to B(1) chains with DP 13-24, resulting in an enhanced grain ECQ
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel C(2)H(2) zinc finger protein TL1 (Translucent endosperm 1) that positively regulates amylose synthesis in rice grains
