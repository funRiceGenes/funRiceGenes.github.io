* **Key message**  
    + The cuticular wax contents were significantly reduced in DHS overexpression plants but increased in dhs mutants compared to the wild type, which resulted in a response opposite that of drought stress
    + DHS exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interacted with the homeodomain-leucine zipper IV protein ROC4

    + __DHS__, __ROC4__, [The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  DHS exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interacted with the homeodomain-leucine zipper IV protein ROC4

    + __DHS__, __ROC4__, [The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  ROC4 acts downstream of DHS, and Os-BDG is a direct downstream target of the DHS-ROC4 cascade
    + __DHS__, __ROC4__, [The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest a mechanism whereby DHS negatively regulates wax biosynthesis by promoting the degradation of ROC4, and they suggest that DHS and ROC4 are valuable targets for the engineering of drought-tolerant rice cultivars
