* **Key message**  
    + These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1
    + In the present study, we used root elongation inhibition assay, lamina inclination assay and coleoptile elongation analysis to demonstrated reduced sensitivity of d1 mutant plants (caused by the null mutation of RGA) to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL), which belongs to brassinosteroids and plays a wide variety of roles in plant growth and development
    + In d1 plants, cell death in response to ethylene and H(2)O(2) was nearly completely abolished, indicating that signaling through Galpha is essential
    + Nine alleles of d1 showed a severer phenotype whilst d1-4 exhibited a mild phenotype with respect to seed size and elongation pattern of internodes
    + Because the d1 mutant is classified as gibberellin-insensitive, we suggest that the GTP-binding protein might be associated with gibberellin signal transduction
    + We identified a spontaneous rice mutant, Epi-d1, that shows a metastable dwarf phenotype
    + The phenotype is mitotically and meiotically inheritable and corresponds to the metastable epigenetic silencing of the DWARF1 (D1) gene
    + To identify novel BR-related genes in rice (Oryza sativa), we monitored the transcriptomic response of the brassinosteroid deficient1 (brd1) mutant, with a defective BR biosynthetic gene, to brassinolide treatment
    + In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1
    + Previous studies suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit known as D1/RGA1 in rice is involved in a phytohormone gibberellin-mediated signaling pathway
    + Indica group Swarna [RGA1(I), accession number HQ634688], its promoter and its transcript upregulation in response to abiotic stresses
    + Rice heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (RGA1): in silico analysis of the gene and promoter and its upregulation under abiotic stress
    + In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase
    + Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tud1 is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs
    + Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment
    + This supports the idea that a D1-mediated BR signaling pathway occurs in rice to affect plant growth and development
    + The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice
    + We used rice dwarf1 (d1) mutants lacking a single-copy Galpha gene and addressed Galpha's role in disease resistance
    + The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1
    + The transcript profiling of RGA1(I) showed upregulation following NaCl, cold and drought stress
    + Here, we describe a novel BR-induced rice gene BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1), encoding a helix-loop-helix protein
    + BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice
    + The GA sensitivity of second leaf sheath elongation in d1 was similar to that of the wild type in terms of dose responsiveness, but the response of internode elongation to GA was much lower in d1
    + The d1 mutant, which is deficient for the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (Galpha) gene of rice, shows dwarfism and sets small round seeds
    + Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5
    + To determine whether dwarfism in d1 is due to a reduction in cell number or to shortened cell length, the cell number of the leaf sheath, the internode, the root and the lemma was compared between Nipponbare, a wild-type rice and d1-5, a d1 allele derived from Nipponbare
    + In addition, cell enlargement was found in roots and lemma of d1-5, although the organ length in d1-5 was shorter than that of wild-type rice
    + Evidence also implicates D1 in the action of a second phytohormone Brassinosteroid (BR) and its pathway
    + Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced
    + However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in d1
    + Furthermore, Os20ox expression was up-regulated, and the GA content was elevated in the stunted internodes of d1
    + In addition, a double mutant between d1 and another GA-signaling mutant, slr, revealed that SLR is epistatic to the D1, supporting that the Galpha protein is involved in GA signaling
    + As brassinosteroid signaling was known to be partially impaired in d1s, the sensitivity to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) was compared among d1 alleles in a T65 genetic background
    + The dwarf1 (d1) mutant of rice has repressed expression of the Galpha subunit RGA1 of heterotrimeric G protein
    + d1 mutants exhibited a highly reduced hypersensitive response to infection by an avirulent race of rice blast
    + Expression of the constitutively active OsRac1, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in d1 mutants restored SE-dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast
    + Analysis of genes encoding proteins related to G protein signaling revealed that four small GTPase genes, two GTPase-activating protein genes, and one GDP dissociation inhibitor gene but not RGA1 were differentially expressed in epidermal cells above adventitious roots, indicating that Galpha activity is regulated posttranscriptionally
    + Previously, we reported that the rice dwarf mutant, d1, is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha)
    + Rice dwarf mutantd1, which is defective in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction
    + In the present study, gibberellin (GA) signaling in d1 and the role of the Galpha protein in the GA-signaling pathway were investigated
    + Transcriptional regulation was not generally affected in the d1 mutant, indicating that altered gene expression is not sufficient to trigger cell death in the absence of Galpha
    + Accordingly, it may be useful to incorporate RGA1 mutation in breeding or biotechnological strategies for development of drought-resistant rice
    + We studied physiological responses to progressive drought of the dwarf rice mutant, d1, in which the RGA1 gene, which encodes the GTP-binding Î±-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional
    + We therefore propose RGA1 as a regulator of photoavoidance and photoprotection mechanisms in rice and highlight the prospect of exploiting modulation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling to increase these characteristics and improve the yield of cereals in the event of abiotic stress
    + We studied physiological mechanisms of photoavoidance and photoprotection of a dwarf rice mutant with erect leaves, d1, in which the RGA1 gene, which encodes the G¦Á subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional
    + Taken together, we propose that RGA1 is one of the regulators in salt response partially through ROS scavenging, which might be helpful in elucidating salt tolerant mechanisms of heterotrimeric G protein in rice
    + The detection results of 15N-ammonium nitrate and an expression analysis of genes associated with nitrogen demonstrated that LW5 serves an important role in nitrate uptake and transport
    + LW5 affects plant architecture and grain size by regulating nitrogen transfer
    + The loss of LW5 functioning leads to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis, vascular bundles, and chlorophyll content
    + Map-based cloning and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing indicated that LW5 affects both the plant architecture and yield
    + Transcription factor network analysis revealed the importance of RGA1 in nitrogen signaling with DEGs such as Nin-like, WRKY, NAC, bHLH families, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, OsCIPK23 and urea transporter
    + Sub-clustering of DEGs-associated PPI network revealed that RGA1 regulates metabolism, stress and gene regulation among others
    + In this work, we investigated the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in gm and drought tolerance in rice d1 mutants, which harbor a null mutation in the G¦Á subunit gene, RGA1
