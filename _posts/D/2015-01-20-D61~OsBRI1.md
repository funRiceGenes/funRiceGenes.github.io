* **Key message**  
    + Our results show that OsBRI1 functions in various growth and developmental processes in rice, including (1) internode elongation, by inducing the formation of the intercalary meristem and the longitudinal elongation of internode cells; (2) bending of the lamina joint; and (3) skotomorphogenesis
    + However, the small grain size of d61-7 counters any increase in grain yield, leading to the same grain yield as that of wild type even at high density
    + The rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant d61 phenotype is caused by loss of function of a rice BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 ortholog, OsBRI1
    + We have identified nine d61 alleles, the weakest of which, d61-7, confers agronomically important traits such as semidwarf stature and erect leaves
    + The biomass of wild type was 38% higher than that of d61-7 at harvest under conventional planting density because of the dwarfism of d61-7
    + We therefore produced transgenic rice with partial suppression of endogenous OsBRI1 expression to obtain the erect-leaf phenotype without grain changes
    + Because erect-leaf habit is considered to increase light capture for photosynthesis, we compared the biomass and grain production of wild-type and d61-7 rice
    + We report here the phenotypical and molecular characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, d61, that is less sensitive to BR compared to the wild type
    + Through map-based cloning, Fn189 was found to be a novel allelic mutant of the DWARF 61 (D61) gene, which encodes the putative BRs receptor OsBRI1
    + Taken together, the kinase activity of OsBRI1 is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate normal plant growth and development in rice
    + Kinase activity of OsBRI1 is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate rice growth and development
    + In contrast to its severe shoot phenotype, the d61-4 mutant had a mild root phenotype
    + The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type
    + Based on these observations, we conclude that OsBRI1 is not essential for pattern formation or organ initiation, but is involved in organ development through controlling cell division and elongation
    + The most severe mutant, d61-4, exhibited severe dwarfism and twisted leaves, although pattern formation and differentiation were normal
    + Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene
    + The grain yield of wild type reached a maximum at middensity, but the yield of d61-7 continued to increase with planting density
    + Since first identifying two alleles of a rice (Oryza sativa) brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61, that were also defective in an orthologous gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), we have isolated eight additional alleles, including null mutations, of the rice BRI1 gene OsBRI1
    + Mutants defective in the G-protein alpha subunit (d1-1) and brassinosteroid receptor, BRI1 (d61-2) also exhibited short seed phenotypes, the former due to impaired cell numbers and the latter due to impaired cell length
    + Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2
    + We cloned a rice gene, OsBRI1, with extensive sequence similarity to that of the Arabidopsis BRI gene, which encodes a putative BR receptor kinase
    + These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1
    + In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1
    + These results indicate that d61-7 produces biomass more effectively than wild type, and consequently more effectively assimilates the biomass in reproductive organ development at high planting density
    + However, the biomass of d61-7 was 35% higher than that of wild type at high planting density
