* **Publication**  
    + [Methylesterification of cell-wall pectin controls the diurnal flower-opening times in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylesterification of cell-wall pectin controls the diurnal flower-opening times in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, Mol Plant.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Importantly, a knockout of DFOT1 showed earlier diurnal flower opening
    + DFOT1 is specifically expressed in the lodicules, and its expression gradually increases with the approach to flowering but decreases with flowering
