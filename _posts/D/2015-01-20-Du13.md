* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning showed that Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein
    + Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.
    + Moreover, Du13 also regulates alternative splicing of other protein-coding transcripts and affects the biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs
    + Du13 coordinates with the nuclear cap-binding complex to regulate the splicing of Wx(b) transcripts in rice endosperm
