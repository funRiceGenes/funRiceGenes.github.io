* **Key message**  
    + The pollen grains of dcm1 are proved to be defective in exine formation
    + Furthermore, peripheral callose surrounding the dcm1 pollen mother cells (PMCs) also disappeared untimely around pachytene
    + The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.
    + We demonstrated that meiotic cytokinesis defect in dcm1 is caused by prematurely dissolution of callosic plates
    + Together, we propose that DCM1 plays an essential role in male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose from prematurely dissolution in rice
    + Rice plants carrying the recessive mutant allele saw1 produces abnormal anthers with a swollen anther wall and aborted pollen
    + A novel CCCH-type zinc-finger protein SAW1 activates OsGA20ox3 to regulate gibberellin homeostasis and anther development in rice.
    + SAW1 encodes a novel nucleus-localizing CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, and this protein could directly bind to the promoter region of the GA synthesis gene OsGA20ox3 to induce its anther-specific expression
    + In the saw1 anther, the significantly decreased OsGA20ox3 expression resulted in lower bioactive GA content, which in turn caused the lower expression of the GA-inducible anther-regulator gene OsGAMYB
    + CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SAW1 in rice generated similar male sterile plants
