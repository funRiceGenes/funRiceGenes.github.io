* **Key message**  
    + Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
    + In this work, we report on defective in outer cell layer specification 1 (Docs1), which is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots
    + Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots
    + Immunostaining with an anti-Docs1 antibody showed that Docs1 was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region
    + These results suggest that Docs1 might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice
