## Key message
1. __leaf__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
2. __root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  In this work, we report on defective in outer cell layer specification 1 Docs1), which is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots
3. __root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant c68 defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots
4. __root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
5. __root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Immunostaining with an anti-Docs1 antibody showed that Docs1 was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region
6. __root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that Docs1 might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice
7. __flower__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
8. __primary root__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant c68 defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots
9. __sheath__, [A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots%5BTitle%5D),  Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers
