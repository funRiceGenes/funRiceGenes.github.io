* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we screened 4416 lab-created T(1) rice T-DNA tagged lines and identified a mutant, designated dh1 (degenerated hull1), with phenotype of degenerated hull and naked pistils and stamens
    + The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
    + Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma
