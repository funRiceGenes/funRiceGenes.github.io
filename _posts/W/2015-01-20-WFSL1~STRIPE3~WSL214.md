* **Key message**  
    + The wfsl1 displayed white fine stripe leaves since tillering stage and abnormal chloroplast structure
    + RNA-seq analysis revealed that chloroplast development and photosynthesis genes were significantly affected in wfsl1 plants
    + Levels of WFSL1 and chloroplast encoded proteins were decreased in wfsl1 mutants via western blot analysis
    + Compared with WT, wfsl1 exhibits lower Chl content and defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes, which resulted in reduced grain yield
    + Taken together, our results show that WFSL1 is critical for chloroplast development, ribosome biogenesis, and light energy utilization, finally affects grain yield
    + Map-based cloning and Bioinformatic analysis indicated that WFSL1 on chromosome 1 contains an &quot;A&quot; to &quot;T&quot; substitution in protein coding region, and encodes a putative metal-dependent phosphohydrolase with HD domain at the N-terminus
    + Here, we isolated and characterized the stripe3 (st3) mutant which exhibited white-striped leaves with reduced chlorophyll content and abnormal chloroplast development during the seedling stage, but gradually produced nearly normal green leaves as it developed
    + In addition, the ROS accumulation level was significantly elevated, and the ROS scavenging enzyme activity was significantly decreased in wsl214 leaf tissue
    + As a result of elevated ROS levels, wsl214 leaf cells underwent DNA damage and programmed cell death
    + The WSL214 encodes an HD domain phosphohydrolase and is widely expressed in various tissues of rice, especially at the highest level in leaf tissue
    + Further research showed that WSL214 promoted the homeostasis of rice leaf cellular ROS in two ways
    + Compared to WT, wsl214 exhibited white-striped leaves, defective chloroplast development, reduced net photosynthetic rate, and overexcitation of photosynthetically active reaction centers
    + Â Second, WSL214 promoted chloroplast development, kept photosynthesis working properly, and reduced ROS produced by photosynthesis
    + WSL214 negatively regulates ROS accumulation and pathogen defense response in rice.
    + However, wsl214 defense response to exogenous pathogens was also enhanced by high ROS levels
    + WSL214 plays an important role in promoting cellular ROS homeostasis by enhancing catalase activity and reducing photosynthetic ROS production
    + First, WSL214 increased the expression of the catalase gene OsCATC, making the intracellular ROS scavenging enzyme more active
