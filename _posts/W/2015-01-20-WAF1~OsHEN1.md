## Expression information

## Key message
1. __floral__, [WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
2. __leaf__, [WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss-of-function mutant of DICER-LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta-siRNA production pathway
3. __leaf__, [WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development

5. __reproductive__, [WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
6. __shoot__, [WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss-of-function mutant of DICER-LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta-siRNA production pathway

## Connection
1. __SHO1~OsDCL4__, __WAF1~OsHEN1__, [DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  In this article, we show that OsDCL2, OsDCL4, and OsHEN1 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell
