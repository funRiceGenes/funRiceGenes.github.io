* **Key message**  
    + WSL6 encoding an Era-type GTP-binding protein is essential for chloroplast development in rice.
    + Rice WSL6 is involved in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and is essential for early chloroplast development
    + Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the wsl6 mutant was defective in early chloroplast development
    + Further research showed that WSL6 binds to the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) subunit of chloroplast ribosome 30S
    + In summary, these results show that WSL6 is essential for chloroplast ribosome biogenesis during early chloroplast development in rice
    + Map-based cloning revealed that WSL6 encodes an Era-type guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein located in chloroplasts
