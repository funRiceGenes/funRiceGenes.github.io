* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identified a new PLS-type protein, WAL3 (Whole Albino Leaf on Chromosome 3), playing important roles in plant chloroplast development
    + WAL3 encoding a PLS-type PPR protein regulates chloroplast development in rice.
    + Knockout of WAL3 gene in Nipponbare variety caused abnormal chloroplast development and showed an albino lethal phenotype
    + In summary, our study revealed that WAL3 is essential for chloroplast development in rice
    + The decreased abundance of photosynthesis-related proteins in wal3 mutants indicated WAL3 influence photosynthesis
    + Transcriptome sequencing showed that WAL3 involved in multiple metabolic pathways including the chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthetic related metabolic pathways
