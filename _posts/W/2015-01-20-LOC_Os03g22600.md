* **Key message**  
    + However, upon ectopic expression, WIN1 appears on the longitudinal sides of leaf sheath cells, correlated with the appearance of a spiral phenotype in shoots
    + Interestingly, ectopic expression of WIN1 does not cause either unequal auxin distribution or actin filament differences in roots, so a spiral phenotype is not observed in roots
    + The action of WIN1 appears to be different from that of other proteins causing a spiral phenotype, and it is likely that WIN1 is involved in 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid-insensitive plasmodesmata-mediated auxin transport
    + The WIN1 protein is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, but is also co-localized to plasmodesmata, where it exhibits a punctate pattern
