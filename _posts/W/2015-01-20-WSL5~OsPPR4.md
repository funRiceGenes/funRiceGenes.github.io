* **Key message**  
    + wsl5 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis under cold stress
    + We propose that the WSL5 allele is required for normal chloroplast development in maintaining retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus under cold stress
    + Arabidopsis atppr4 and rice osppr4 mutants are embryo-lethal and seedling-lethal 3 weeks after germination, respectively, showing that PPR4 is essential in the development of both dicot and monocot plants

* **Connection**  
    + __CYP96B5~WSL5__, __WSL5~OsPPR4__, [Cytochrome P450 family member CYP96B5 hydroxylates alkanes to primary alcohols and is involved in rice leaf cuticular wax synthesis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cytochrome P450 family member CYP96B5 hydroxylates alkanes to primary alcohols and is involved in rice leaf cuticular wax synthesis.%5BTitle%5D),  WSL5 is predicted to encode a cytochrome P450 family member CYP96B5
