* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
    + In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens
    + primes) the transcription, accumulation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK3 as well as the expression of the downstream WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY70 and several jasmonate biosynthesis genes, resulting in a higher accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA)
    + Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that OsMPK3 is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance
    + In addition, OsWRKY70 overexpression lines displayed an enlarged leaf angle, reduced plant height, longer grains, and higher BR sensitivity, phenotypes similar to those of OsWRKY53 overexpression lines
    + Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size in rice.
    + OsWRKY24 functions redundantly with OsWRKY53, while OsWRKY70 functions differently from OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size
    + However, whether the OsWRKY53 homologs OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 also contribute to grain size which remains unknown
    + Importantly, a systematic characterization of seed length in the oswrky70 single, the oswrky53 oswrky70 double and the oswrky24 oswrky53 oswrky70 triple mutant indicated that loss of OsWRKY70 also leads to increased seed length, suggesting that OsWRKY70 might play a role distinct from that of OsWRKY53 in regulating grain size
    + Taken together, these findings suggest that OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 regulate rice grain size redundantly and independently from OsWRKY53
