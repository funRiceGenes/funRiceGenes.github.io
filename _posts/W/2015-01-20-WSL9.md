* **Key message**  
    + WSL9 Encodes an HNH Endonuclease Domain-Containing Protein that Is Essential for Early Chloroplast Development in Rice
    + Expression levels of plastid genome-encoded genes, which are transcribed by plastid-coded RNA polymerase (PEP), chloroplast development genes and photosynthesis-related genes were altered in the wsl9 mutant
    + Conclusion: WSL9 encodes an HNH endonuclease domain-containing protein that is essential for early chloroplast development
    + The wsl9 mutant was albinic when grown at low temperature
