* **Key message**  
    + Chlorophyll autofluorescence observations and transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that wp1 mutants are defective in early chloroplast development
    + Western blot analyses of chloroplast-encoded proteins showed that wp1 mutants were defective in chloroplast protein synthesis, although transcription of some genes was higher in wp1 than in wild type
    + We found that wp1 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis
