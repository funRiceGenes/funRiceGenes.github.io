* **Key message**  
    + We also show that two functionally redundant transcription factor genes, WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6 (WOX6) and WOX11, are expressed asymmetrically in response to auxin to connect gravitropism responses with the control of rice tiller angle.
    + Subsequently, auxin induces the asymmetric expression of WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6 (WOX6) and WOX11, two transcription factors that specify tiller angle.
    + WOX6 and WOX11 Are Downstream Regulators of the LA1-Dependent Asymmetric Auxin Pathway to Control Tiller Angle
    + These results show that WOX6 and WOX11 function downstream of auxin in responses to gravistimulation and act redundantly to control rice tiller angle.
