* **Key message**  
    + Intriguingly, besides pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity conferred by different R proteins, including Xa3/Xa26, Xa4, and Xa21, was also disturbed by wed to a certain extent, indicating the existence of shared regulatory mechanisms for various defense systems
    + The unexpected accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), along with downregulation of NONEXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1), in wed indicates the potential presence of a feedback regulation loop of SA biosynthesis in rice
    + Epistasis analyses illustrated that SA accumulation and the NLR-associated components RAR1, OsRac1, and PhyB are indispensable for the wed phenotypes
