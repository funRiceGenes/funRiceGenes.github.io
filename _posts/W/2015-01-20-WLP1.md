* **Key message**  
    + The transcription pattern of a number of genes involved in plastidial transcription/translation and in photosynthesis was altered in the wlp1 mutants
    + The WLP1 protein localized to the chloroplast
    + These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions
    + The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions
    + Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
    + WLP1 was mainly transcribed in green tissues and particularly abundantly in the early seedling leaves
    + In addition, the expression level of WLP1 was induced by the low temperature
