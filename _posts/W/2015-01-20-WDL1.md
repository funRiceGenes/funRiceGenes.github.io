## Key message
1. __cuticle__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the identification of a cuticle membrane mutant, wilted dwarf and lethal 1 wdl1), from a rice T-DNA insertional population
2. __cuticle__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D), Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice
3. __stomatal__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Stomatal cells and pavement cells are smaller in the mutant, suggesting that WDL1 affects epidermal cell differentiation
4. __stomata__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Stomatal cells and pavement cells are smaller in the mutant, suggesting that WDL1 affects epidermal cell differentiation
5. __cutin__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We propose that WDL1 is involved in cutin organization, affecting depolymerizable components
6. __dwarf__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the identification of a cuticle membrane mutant, wilted dwarf and lethal 1 wdl1), from a rice T-DNA insertional population
7. __dwarf__, [Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice%5BTitle%5D), Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 WDL1 causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice
