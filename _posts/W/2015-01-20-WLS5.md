* **Key message**  
    + A 3-bp deletion of WLS5 gene leads to weak growth and early leaf senescence in rice.
    + Knockout of LOC_Os05g04900 in Nipponbare plants caused leaf senescence, confirming this locus as the causal gene for WLS5
    + Further molecular study of WLS5 will uncover the roles of this gene in plant growth and leaf senescence
    + Histological analysis showed that the poor growth of wls5 plants involved a reduction in cell length and number
    + The wls5 mutants also exhibited significantly higher stomatal density and altered phytohormone contents compared with wild-type plants
    + Physiological analysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the wls5 cells had abnormal chloroplasts, and the mutants underwent chlorophyll degradation triggered by accumulation of reactive oxygen species
