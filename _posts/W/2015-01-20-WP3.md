* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, we demonstrate that the recessive white-panicle phenotype in the wp3 mutant is inherited in a typical Mendelian manner, while the white-striped leaf phenotype in wp3 is maternally inherited
    + Further investigation showed that WP3 encodes a protein most likely targeted to mitochondria and is specifically expressed in rice panicles
