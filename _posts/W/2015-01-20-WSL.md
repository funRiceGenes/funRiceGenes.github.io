* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [KC543701](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KC543701)

* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning revealed that WSL encodes a newly identified rice PPR protein which targets the chloroplasts.
    + The wsl shows enhanced sensitivity to ABA, salinity, and sugar, and it accumulates more H2O2 than wild-type.
