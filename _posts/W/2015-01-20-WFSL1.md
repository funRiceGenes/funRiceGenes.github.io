* **Key message**  
    + The wfsl1 displayed white fine stripe leaves since tillering stage and abnormal chloroplast structure
    + RNA-seq analysis revealed that chloroplast development and photosynthesis genes were significantly affected in wfsl1 plants
    + Levels of WFSL1 and chloroplast encoded proteins were decreased in wfsl1 mutants via western blot analysis
    + Compared with WT, wfsl1 exhibits lower Chl content and defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes, which resulted in reduced grain yield
    + Taken together, our results show that WFSL1 is critical for chloroplast development, ribosome biogenesis, and light energy utilization, finally affects grain yield
    + Map-based cloning and Bioinformatic analysis indicated that WFSL1 on chromosome 1 contains an &quot;A&quot; to &quot;T&quot; substitution in protein coding region, and encodes a putative metal-dependent phosphohydrolase with HD domain at the N-terminus
