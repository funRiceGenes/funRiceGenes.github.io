## Key message
1. __cuticle__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
2. __tapetum__, [Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  These biochemical and developmental defects in tapetum found in wda1 mutants are earlier events than those in other male-sterile mutants, which showed defects of lipidic molecules in exine
3. __pollen__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
4. __tapetal__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules

6. __anther__, [Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the characterization of a T-DNA insertional mutant in the Wax-deficient anther1 (Wda1) gene of rice (Oryza sativa), which shows significant defects in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids in both layers
7. __anther__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules
