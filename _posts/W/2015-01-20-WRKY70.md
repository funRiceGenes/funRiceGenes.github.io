* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
    + In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens
