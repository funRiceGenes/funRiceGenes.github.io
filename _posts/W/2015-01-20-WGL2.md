* **Key message**  
    + WGL2 encodes a conserved ribosomal protein, which localizes to the chloroplast
    + WGL2 is preferentially expressed in the leaf, and mutating WGL2 led to obvious changes in the expression of genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, chloroplast development, and ribosome development compared with wild-type
    + WGL2 is essential for early chloroplast development in rice
    + Map-based cloning and DNA sequencing analyses of wgl2 revealed a single-nucleotide substitution (G to T) in the first exon of LOC_Os03g55930, which resulted in a substitution of glycine 92 to valine (G92<U+00A0>V)
