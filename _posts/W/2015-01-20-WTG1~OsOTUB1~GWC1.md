* **Key message**  
    + WTG1 determines grain size and shape mainly by influencing cell expansion
    + Overexpression of WTG1 results in narrow, thin and long grains due to narrow and long cells, further supporting the role of WTG1 in determining grain size and shape
    + Thus, our findings identify the otubain-like protease WTG1 as an important factor that determines grain size and shape, suggesting WTG1 has the potential to improve grain size and shape in rice
    + WTG1 is expressed in developing grains and panicles, and the GFP-WTG1 fusion protein is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm
    + OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
    + Downregulation of OsOTUB1 enhances meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice
    + Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture
    + GWC1 is essential for high grain quality in rice
    + The gwc1 mutants had poor grain appearance quality consistent with the measured values for the percentage of grains with chalkiness, square of chalky endosperm, the total starch, amylose and sucrose contents
    + Milling quality and grain size were also affected in the gwc1 mutants
    + GWC1 is likely to regulate grain appearance quality through genes involved in sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis
    + Overall, the present findings reveal that GWC1 is important for grain quality and yield due to its effects on grain chalkiness and size
    + GWC1 transcripts accumulated to high levels in early endosperm after fertilization and developing inflorescences, and GWC1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm
