* **Key message**  
    + The ribosome biogenesis defect and plastid-encoded RNA polymerase complex activity impairment in wsp1 potentially account for the stripe leaf in the seedling and white panicle in the heading stage
    + The RNA editing factor WSP1 is essential for chloroplast development in rice.
    + Transmission electron microscopy and chlorophyll content measurements revealed a chloroplast developmental defect and a reduced and low rate of chlorophyll accumulation in wsp1
    + Owing to plastid RNA factor editing defect, chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and ndhA splicing were also impaired in wsp1
    + Together, this is the first study to demonstrate the importance of a rice WSP1 protein in chloroplast development and to broaden our knowledge about MORF family members (WSP1) in rice
