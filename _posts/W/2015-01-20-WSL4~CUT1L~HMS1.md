* **Key message**  
    + HMS1 catalyzed the biosynthesis of the C26 and C28 VLCFAs, contributing to the formation of bacula and tryphine in the pollen wall, which protect the pollen from dehydration
    + Under low-humidity, hms1 pollen showed poor adhesion and reduced germination on the stigmas, which could be rescued by increasing humidity
    + HMS1 Interacts with HMS1I to Regulate Very-long-chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis and the Humidity-sensitive Genic Male Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa).
    + The hms1 mutant displayed decreased seed setting at low-humidity, but normal seed setting at high-humidity
    + Furthermore, both japonica and indica rice varieties with defective HMS1 exhibited HGMS, suggesting that hms1 could potentially be used in hybrid breeding
