* **Key message**  
    + These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice
    + Real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in ylc1 mutant at different temperatures
    + In this study, we characterized a rice mutant named young leaf chlorosis 1 (ylc1) from a (6)(0)Co-irradiated population
    + The Young Leaf Chlorosis 1 (YLC1) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a protein of unknown function belonging to the DUF3353 superfamily
    + In rice protoplasts, the YLC1 protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern
    + Differential protein abundances of OsV5A and OsV5B in rice seedlings at different leaf developmental stages were also revealed
    + Deficiency of OsV5A and OsV5B occurred in pre-emerged and emerging leaves in osv5a seedlings at 22 Â°C, leading to reduced POR accumulation and chlorophyll content
    + OsV5A apparently developed a specialized role for regulating POR abundances at the leaf pre-emergence stage while the same function is performed by OsV5B during leaf emergence and expansion
    + Both OsV5A and OsV5B are localized in the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes
    + OsV5A and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress
    + Map-based cloning revealed that OsV5A is a J-like protein with four transmembrane domains
