* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of Ygl8 indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues
    + The levels of Chl a, Chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in ygl8 than those in the WT throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the Chl a/b ratio
    + Independent of Chl biosynthesis and photosystem, YGL8 may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences Chl biosynthesis
    + Chloroplast development was abnormal in the yl2 mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae
    + Genetic analyses revealed that YL2 encodes a thylakoid membrane-localized protein with significant sequence similarity to UMP kinase proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
    + Prokaryotic UMP kinase activity was subsequently confirmed, with YL2 deficiency causing a significant reduction in chlorophyll accumulation and photochemical efficiency
