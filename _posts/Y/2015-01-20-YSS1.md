* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, levels of chloroplast proteins are mostly reduced in yss1 seedlings
    + Together, our findings identify YSS1 as a novel regulator of PEP activity essential for chloroplast development at rice seedling stage
    + YSS1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-localized protein belonging to the DUF3727 superfamily
