* **Key message**  
    + YGL18 is expressed in green tissues, especially in leaf organs, where it functions in chloroplasts
    + The retarded growth of ygl18 mutant plants was caused by the high light intensity
    + Based on these results, it is suggested that YGL18 plays essential roles in light-related chlorophyll synthesis and light intensity-involved plant growth
    + Map-based cloning of this mutant identified the YGL18 gene LOC_Os06g04150
