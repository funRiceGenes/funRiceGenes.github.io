* **Key message**  
    + The Rice Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase YLC3 Regulates Amino Acid Homeostasis and Chloroplast Development Under Low Temperature.
    + Moreover, uncharged tRNA-Asp accumulation and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2Î± was detected in the mutant, suggesting that YLC3 regulates the homeostasis of amino acid metabolism and chloroplast thylakoid development through modulation of processes during protein synthesis
    + Map-based cloning identified that YLC3 encodes an aspartyl-tRNA synthetase which is localized in cytosol and mitochondria
