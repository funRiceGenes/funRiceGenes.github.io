* **Key message**  
    + YPD1 was preferentially expressed in the leaf and encodes an LRR-Like1 (LRRL1) protein
    + These findings revealed that the novel rice LRRL1 protein YPD1 affects rice chloroplast development and leaf senescence
    + YPD1 localized on the chloroplast membrane
    + The ypd1 mutants exhibited a yellow and dwarf phenotype from germination, and premature senescence starting at tillering
    + Moreover, the ypd1 mutants were sensitive to high light, which accelerated cell death and senescence
    + Trypan blue staining, TUNEL experiments, NBT staining, and DAB staining demonstrated that the ypd1 mutants showed cell death and accumulated reactive oxygen species
