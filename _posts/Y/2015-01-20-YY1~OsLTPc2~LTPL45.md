* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized
    + The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle
