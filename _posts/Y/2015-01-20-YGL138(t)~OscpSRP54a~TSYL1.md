* **Key message**  
    + The defective OscpSRP54a (LOC_Os11g05552) was responsible for the pale green leaf phenotype of the viable pale green leaf 14 (pgl14) mutant
    + Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice
    + OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway
    + Both OscpSRP54a and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage
    + Here, we isolated and characterized a thermosensitive yellow-green leaf mutant named tsyl1 (thermosensitive yellow leaf 1) from an ethylmethylsulfone (EMS)-mutagenized pool of rice
    + Furthermore, and chloroplast development-related genes was influenced in tsyl1 at different temperatures
    + The expression of tsyl1 was induced by high temperature
    + These results indicated that the TSYL1 gene plays a key role in chlorophyll biosynthesis and is affected by temperature at the transcriptional level
    + At the mature stage of the tsyl1 mutant, the plant height, tiller number, number of spikelets per panicle and 1000 seed weight were decreased significantly compared to those of wild-type plants, but the seed setting rate and panicle length were not
