    + A Nucleus-Encoded Chloroplast Protein YL1 Is Involved in Chloroplast Development and Efficient Biogenesis of Chloroplast ATP Synthase in Rice.
    + The YL1 mutation showed reduced chlorophyll contents, abnormal chloroplast morphology, and decreased photochemical efficiency
    + Moreover, YL1 deficiency disrupts the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis
    + Map-based cloning and characterization of the novel yellow-green leaf gene ys83 in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Taken together, we successfully identified a novel yellow-green leaf gene YS83
    + Gene YS83 was expressed in a wide range of tissues, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast
    + 6%, respectively, meanwhile its seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight (seed size) were not significantly affected in the mutant, so leaf-color mutant gene ys83 could be used as a trait marker gene in commercial hybrid rice production
    + Map-based cloning and sequencing analysis suggested that the candidate gene was YS83 (LOC_Os02g05890) encoding a protein containing 165 amino acid residues
