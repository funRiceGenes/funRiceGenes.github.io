* **Key message**  
    + Rice jmjC domain-containing gene JMJ706 encodes H3K9 demethylase required for floral organ development
    + Gene expression and histone modification analysis indicates that JMJ706 regulates a subset of flower development regulatory genes
    + Taken together, our data suggest that rice JMJ706 encodes a heterochromatin-associated H3K9 demethylase involved in the regulation of flower development in rice
    + OsGRF6/OsGRF10 localized to the nucleus, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 bind the GA response element in the promoters of OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, which were reported to participate in the regulation of floral organ development
    + OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.
