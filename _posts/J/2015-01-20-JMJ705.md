* **Key message**  
    + The results suggest that JMJ705 is a biotic stress-responsive H3K27me2/3 demethylase that may remove H3K27me3 from marked defense-related genes and increase their basal and induced expression during pathogen infection
    + Further analysis revealed that JMJ705 is involved in methyl jasmonate-induced dynamic removal of H3K27me3 and gene activation
    + Jumonji C domain protein JMJ705-mediated removal of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation is involved in defense-related gene activation in rice
    + We revealed that DGC7 is regulated directly by JMJ705 through methyl jasmonate-mediated epigenetic control3

    + __JMJ705__, __WOX11__, [WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we show that WOX11 interacts with the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJ705 to activate gene expression during shoot development in rice
    + __JMJ705__, __WOX11__, [WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Genetic analysis indicates that WOX11 and JMJ705 cooperatively control shoot growth and commonly regulate the expression of a set of genes involved in meristem identity, chloroplast biogenesis, and energy metabolism in the shoot apex
    + __JMJ705__, __WOX11__, [WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Loss of WOX11 led to increased H3K27me3 and overexpression of JMJ705 decreased the methylation levels at a subset of common targets
    + __JMJ705__, __WOX11__, [WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=WOX11 recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The results suggest that recruitment of JMJ705 to specific developmental pathway genes is promoted by DNA-binding transcription factors and that WOX11 functions to stimulate shoot growth through epigenetic reprogramming of genes involved in meristem development and energy-generating pathways
