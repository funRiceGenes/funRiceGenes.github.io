* **Key message**  
    + JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation
    + In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity
    + Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb
    + Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response
    + JAmyb has been reported to be associated with disease response
    + In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response
    + Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of JAmyb stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis
    + Our observations suggest that JAmyb plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in rice
    + After inoculation with the blast isolate Hoku1, the expression of OsJAMyb was more rapidly and strongly induced in the seedlings of blast-resistant Heikezijing compared with that in the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo
    + The expression of OsJAMyb gene was detected in the root, stem, leaf, sheath, immature panicle and flowering panicle of rice, with highest expression in the leaf
    + The OsJAMyb overexpressing transgenic lines (T3 generation) in Suyunuo showed increased resistance to blast infection with less lesion number in inoculated leaves compared with non-transgenic control plants
    + The results indicate that OsJAMyb might be involved in the resistance to blast infection in rice
    + In this study we identified one MYB transcription factor gene OsJAMyb from rice landrace Heikezijing, which encodes a protein with 283 amino-acid residues belonging to R2R3-type MYB transcription factor family
