* **Key message**  
    + In a further feeding assay with exogenous glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant that consumes H2O2, the H2O2 accumulation and leaf senescence phenotypes of hpa1 were obviously compensated
    + Taken together, our findings suggest that the accumulation of H2O2 in hpa1 may be mediated by an altered folate status and redox homeostasis, subsequently triggering leaf senescence
    + Proteomics and enzyme activity analyses further revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation complex I and complex V were differentially expressed in hpa1, which was consistent with the H2O2 accumulation in hpa1
    + Map-based cloning revealed that HPA1 encodes a tetrahydrofolate deformylase, and its deficiency led to the accumulation of tetrahydrofolate, 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate, in contrast, a decrease in 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate
