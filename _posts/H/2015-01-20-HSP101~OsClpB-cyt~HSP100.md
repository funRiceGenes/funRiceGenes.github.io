* **Key message**  
    + Our results showed that a positive feedback loop formed by two heat-inducible genes, HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 (HSP101) and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN (HSA32), at the posttranscriptional level prolongs the effect of heat acclimation in rice seedlings
    + Rice hsp101 cDNA expression in hsp104 deficient yeast also caused recovery in tolerance against arsenite
    + The interplay between HSP101 and HSA32 also affects basal thermotolerance of rice seeds
    + In the temperature regime tested, 45 degrees C treatment to intact rice seedlings for 2 h showed maximal levels of hsp101 mRNA
    + Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds
    + OsClpB-cyt transcript is shown to be enriched at milk and dough stages of seed development
    + Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE(-273 to -280)) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues
    + While Os05g44340 encodes cytoplasmic Hsp100 protein, those encoded by the other four genes are predicted to have chloroplast transit peptides
