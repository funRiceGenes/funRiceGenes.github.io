* **Key message**  
    + The dominant Hybrid weakness i1 (Hwi1) gene from wild rice is genetically incompatible with Teqing and induced a set of weakness symptoms, including growth suppression, yield decrease, impaired nutrient absorption, and the retardation of crown root initiation

* **Connection**  
    + __Hwi1__, __Hwi2__, [A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that two incompatible dominant loci (Hwi1 and Hwi2) involving three genes are likely to determine the high temperature-dependent expression of hybrid weakness in interspecific hybrids of rice
    + __Hwi1__, __Hwi2__, [A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Functional analysis indicated that pyramiding of Hwi1 and Hwi2 activates the autoimmune response in the basal nodes of hybrids, interrupting root formation and then impairing shoot growth
