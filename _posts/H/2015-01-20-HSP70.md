* **Key message**  
    + By contrast, we found that during heat stress the expression of hsp70 correlates well with increases in internal ion concentrations, and can also be induced by excess salt or ethanol at normal growth temperatures
    + PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Our studies reveal that HSP70, a cellular chaperone gene, is over-expressed at the mRNA and protein levels when rice seedlings are exposed to As and heat
