* **Key message**  
    + D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling
    + We characterized a tillering dwarf mutant d88 derived from Oryza sativa ssp
    + A reduction in number and size of parenchyma cells around stem marrow cavity as well as a delay in the elongation of parenchyma cells caused slender tillers and dwarfism in the d88 mutant
    + Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14
    + The d14 mutant exhibits increased shoot branch-ing with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive mutants d10 and d3, respectively
    + Here, we provide evidence that DWARF14 (D14) inhibits rice tillering and may act as a new compo-nent of the strigolactone-dependent branching inhibition pathway
    + d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers
    + Here, we identified a rice mutant htd2 from one of the 15,000 transgenic rice lines, which is characterized by a high tillering and dwarf phenotype
    + HTD2 transcripts were expressed mainly in leaf
    + Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1)
    + Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
    + SL signalling requires the hormone-dependent interaction of DWARF 14 (D14), a probable candidate SL receptor, with DWARF 3 (D3), an F-box component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
    + Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering
    + However, unlike with d10, the d14 branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones
    + The potential relationship between the tiller formation associated genes and D88 is discussed and future identification of the substrate for D88 may lead to the characterization of new pathways regulating plant development
    + We propose that D14 functions downstream of strigolactone synthesis, as a component of hormone signaling or as an enzyme that participates in the conversion of strigolactones to the bioactive form
    + " Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation"
    + The results suggest that the HTD2 gene could negatively regulate tiller bud outgrowth by the strigolactone pathway
    + Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice
    + D88, thus, represents a new category of genes that regulates cell growth and organ development and consequently plant architecture
    + Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway
    + The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the alpha/beta hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception
    + We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth
    + In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice
