* **Key message**  
    + Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.
    + In this study, we identified a dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), which is caused by the activation of a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12
    + Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype
    + These results reveal a novel regulatory module that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice
    + Quantification of GA levels in the uppermost internodes revealed that the HOX12 knockdown plants contain higher levels of the major biologically active GAs (such as GA1 and GA4) than these in the wild type
    + Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.
    + Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype
    + Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development
