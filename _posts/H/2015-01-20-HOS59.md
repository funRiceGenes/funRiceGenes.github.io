* **Key message**  
    + KNOX II transcription factor HOS59 functions in regulating rice grain size.
    + Meanwhile, our IP-MS datasets showed that HOS59 was closely associated with BELL family proteins, some grain size regulators (OsSPL13, OsSPL16, OsSPL18, SLG, etc
    + Compared with wild-type plants, the hos59 mutants have longer grains and increased glume cell length, a loose plant architecture, and drooping leaves, while the overexpression lines showed smaller grain size, erect leaves, and lower plant height
    + The qRT-PCR results showed that mutation of the HOS59 gene led to upregulation of some grain size-related genes such as OsSPL13, OsSPL18, and PGL2
    + In summary, our results indicate that HOS59 may be a repressor of the downstream target genes, negatively regulating glume cell length, rice grain size, plant architecture, etc
