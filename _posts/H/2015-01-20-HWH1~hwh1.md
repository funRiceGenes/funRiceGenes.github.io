* **Key message**  
    + A comparison of the sequences of candidate genes among both parents and HB plants revealed that hwh1 encoded a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase with one amino acid change compared to Hwh1 and that hwh2 probably encoded a putative hexose transporter with a six amino acid insertion compared to Hwh2
