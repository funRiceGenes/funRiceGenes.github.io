* **Key message**  
    + Natural variants in HAN1 diverged between indica and japonica rice during domestication
    + Natural variation in the HAN1 gene confers chilling tolerance in rice and allowed adaptation to a temperate climate.
    + A specific allele from temperate japonica rice, which gained a putative MYB cis-element in the promoter of HAN1 during the divergence of the two japonica ecotypes, enhances the chilling tolerance of temperate japonica rice and allows it to adapt to a temperate climate
    + HAN1 encodes an oxidase that catalyzes the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile) and fine-tunes the JA-mediated chilling response
