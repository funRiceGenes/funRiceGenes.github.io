* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Population genetic analysis indicated that HL6 was under negative selection during rice domestication
    + We found that OsGL6 interacted with serine/threonine protein kinase OSK3 (OSK3) or COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5a (CSN5) in yeast

* **Connection**  
    + __HL6~OsGL6__, __OsYUCCA5__, [Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5
    + __HL6~OsGL6__, __OsSPL10__, [Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes%5BTitle%5D),  HAIRY LEAF6 (HL6) encodes another transcription factor that regulates trichome initiation and elongation, and OsSPL10 directly binds to the HL6 promoter to regulate its expression
