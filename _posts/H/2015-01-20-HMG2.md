* **Key message**  
    + Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers
    + Our result showed that mRNA levels of rice Hmg2 were strongly induced in seedlings and influorescence in the early development stage
