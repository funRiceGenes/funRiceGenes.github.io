4. __flower__, [The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism
5. __flower__, [The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution%5BTitle%5D)),  The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering
6. __flower__, [The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions
7. __flower__, [The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism
8. __flower__, [The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution
