* **Key message**  
    + Further studies showed that rHsp90 mRNA accumulated following exposure to several abiotic stresses, including salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), desiccation (using polyethylene glycol), high pH (8
    + Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) over-expressing rHsp90 exhibited greater tolerance to NaCl, Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) and tobacco seedlings over-expressing rHsp90 could tolerate salt concentrations as high as 200 mM NaCl, whereas untransformed control seedlings couldn't
    + RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species
