    + [Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ammonium protects rice against rice stripe virus by activating HDA703/OsBZR1-mediated BR signaling.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, Plant Sci.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We also show that in contrast to NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) does not affect BR biosynthesis but promotes BR signaling by upregulating the expression of HDA703 and promoting the accumulation of OsBZR1 in rice shoots
    + Consistently, increase of the expression of HDA703 or decrease of the expression of Ghd7 enhances rice resistance to RSV
