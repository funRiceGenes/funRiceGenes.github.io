* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of HDA705 in rice decreased ABA and salt stress resistance during seed germination
    + Moreover, overexpression of HDA705 in rice enhanced osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage
    + Involvement of rice histone deacetylase HDA705 in seed germination and in response to ABA and abiotic stresses.
    + Delayed seed germination of HDA705 overexpression lines was associated with down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes and up-regulation of ABA biosynthetic genes
    + Our findings demonstrate that HDA705 may play a role in regulating seed germination and the response to abiotic stresses in rice
