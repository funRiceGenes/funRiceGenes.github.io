* **Key message**  
    + The genetic analysis of the htd-1 mutant indicated that the phenotypes of high tillering and dwarf were controlled by a recessive gene, termed htd1
    + The HTD1 gene is expressed in both shoot and root tissues
    + Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway
    + By evaluating Pro(HTD1):GUS expression, we found that the HTD1 gene is mainly expressed in vascular bundle tissues throughout the plant
    + The HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 (HTD1) gene encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3
    + Complementation analyses for HTD1 confirm that the defect in HTD1 is responsible for both high-tillering and dwarf phenotypes in the htd1 mutant
    + Auxin induction of HTD1 expression suggests that auxin may regulate rice tillering partly through upregulation of HTD1 gene transcription
    + Restoration of dwarf phenotype after the removal of axillary buds indicates that the dwarfism of the htd1 mutant may be a consequence of excessive tiller production
    + Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1)
    + Moreover, the mRNA levels of D3, HTD1 and D10, which are orthologs of Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9, MAX3 and MAX4, respectively, increased during cell death
    + A substitution mutation in OsCCD7 cosegregates with dwarf and increased tillering phenotype in rice.
    + Targeted mutations in five carotenoid catabolism genes failed to boost carotenoid accumulation in rice seeds, but produced dwarf and high tillering mutants when OsCCD7 gene was knocked out
    + However, transgenic plants with homozygous or bi-allelic mutations to the OsCCD7 gene were extremely dwarfish with more tillers and lower seed setting than other transgenic or nontransgenic plants
    + We found that the HTD1 gene had been widely utilized and co-selected with Semidwarf 1 (SD1), both contributing to the improvement of plant architecture in modern rice varieties since the Green Revolution in the 1960s
