* **Key message**  
    + Natural variation of HTH5 from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.
    + Moreover, we found that two SNPs located in the HTH5 promoter region are involved with its expression level and associated with heat tolerance diversity
    + These findings suggest that the novel gene HTH5 might have great potential value for heightening rice tolerance to heat stress to the on-going threat of global warming
    + Overexpression ofâ€‰HTH5 increased the seed-setting rate of rice plants under heat stress at the heading stage, whereas suppression of HTH5 resulted in greater susceptibility to heat stress
    + Further investigation indicated that HTH5 reduces reactive oxygen species accumulation at high temperatures by increasing the heat-induced pyridoxal 5&#x27;-phosphate (PLP) content
