    + Rice histone deacetylase HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.
    + HDA704 enhances drought and salt tolerance via stomata-regulated mechanism
    + In this study on rice, we identified the RPD3/HDA1-type histone deacetylase HDA704 as a positive regulatory factor in drought and salt tolerance
    + HDA704 was induced by drought and salt stresses
    + Overexpression of HDA704 in transgenic rice promoted stomatal closure, decreased the number of stomata and slowed down the rate of water loss, consequently resulting in increased drought and salt tolerance
    + By contrast, knockdown of HDA704 in transgenic rice decreased stomatal closure and accelerated the rate of water loss, leading to decrease drought and salt tolerance
    + Collectively, these findings reveal that HDA704 positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by repressing the expression of DST and ABIL2
    + HDA704 negatively regulates stomatal aperture and density, repressing the transcription of DST and ABIL2 by histone deacetylation modification
