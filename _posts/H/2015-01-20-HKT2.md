## Connection
1. __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  We also isolated two cDNAs homologous to Ni-OsHKT1 from salt-tolerant indica rice, cv Pokkali (Po-OsHKT1, Po-OsHKT2)
2. __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The predicted amino acid sequence of Ni-OsHKT1 shares 100% identity with Po-OsHKT1 and 91% identity with Po-OsHKT2, and they are 66-67% identical to wheat HKT1
3. __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  We further characterized the ion-transport properties of OsHKT1 and OsHKT2 using an expression system in the heterologous cells, yeast and Xenopus oocytes
4. __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHKT2 was capable of completely rescuing a K+-uptake deficiency mutation in yeast, whereas OsHKT1 was not under K+-limiting conditions
5. __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  When OsHKTs were expressed in Na+-sensitive yeast, OsHKT1 rendered the cells more Na+-sensitive than did OsHKT2 in high NaCl conditions
6. __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that two isoforms of HKT transporters, a Na+ transporter (OsHKT1) and a Na+- and K+-coupled transporter (OsHKT2), may act harmoniously in the salt tolerant indica rice
