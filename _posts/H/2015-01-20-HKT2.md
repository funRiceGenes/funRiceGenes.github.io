* **Information**  
    + Symbol: HKT2  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), 2001, The Plant Journal.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We also isolated two cDNAs homologous to Ni-OsHKT1 from salt-tolerant indica rice, cv Pokkali (Po-OsHKT1, Po-OsHKT2)
    + These results suggest that two isoforms of HKT transporters, a Na+ transporter (OsHKT1) and a Na+- and K+-coupled transporter (OsHKT2), may act harmoniously in the salt tolerant indica rice

    + __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), We further characterized the ion-transport properties of OsHKT1 and OsHKT2 using an expression system in the heterologous cells, yeast and Xenopus oocytes
    + __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), OsHKT2 was capable of completely rescuing a K+-uptake deficiency mutation in yeast, whereas OsHKT1 was not under K+-limiting conditions
    + __HKT2__, __OsHKT2;1~OsHKT1__, [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), When OsHKTs were expressed in Na+-sensitive yeast, OsHKT1 rendered the cells more Na+-sensitive than did OsHKT2 in high NaCl conditions
