* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions
    + Identification of a novel gene ef7 conferring an extremely long basic vegetative growth phase in rice
    + In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions
    + We previously identified a quantitative trait locus, Heading date 17 (Hd17), that is associated with a difference in flowering time between Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L
    + Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway
    + Expression analyses of flowering time-related genes demonstrated that Ef7 negatively regulates the expression of Ghd7, which is a repressor of the photoperiodic control of rice flowering, and consequently up-regulates the expression of the downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes under both SD and LD conditions
    + Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice
    + OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering
    + Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering
    + Thus, our results show that Ef7 functions as a floral promoter by repressing Ghd7 expression under both SD and LD conditions
    + Ef7 encodes an ELF3-like protein and promotes rice flowering by negatively regulating the floral repressor gene Ghd7 under both short- and long-day conditions
    + In this study, we identified and characterized the Ef7 gene, one of the rice orthologs of Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3)
    + The ef7 mutant HS276, which was induced by gamma-irradiation of the japonica rice cultivar 'Gimbozu', flowers late under both SD and LD conditions
    + Genetic analyses with a non-functional Ghd7 allele provided further evidence that the delayed flowering of ef7 is mediated through the Ghd7 pathway
