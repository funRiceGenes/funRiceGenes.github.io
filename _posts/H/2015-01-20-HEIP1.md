* **Key message**  
    + HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
    + HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene

* **Connection**  
    + __HEI10__, __HEIP1__, [HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, through screening for HEI10-interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid system, we identify a CO protein HEI10 Interaction Protein 1 (HEIP1) in rice
    + __HEI10__, __HEIP1__, [HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene
    + __HEI10__, __HEIP1__, [HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Between these two proteins, HEI10 is required for the loading of HEIP1, but not vice versa
    + __HEIP1__, __MER3~RCK__, [HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, the loading of HEIP1 depends on ZIP4, but not on MER3, MSH4, or MSH5
    + __HEIP1__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  HEIP1 interacts directly with ZIP4 and MSH5
    + __HEIP1__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, the loading of HEIP1 depends on ZIP4, but not on MER3, MSH4, or MSH5
