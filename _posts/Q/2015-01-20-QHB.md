* **Key message**  
    + During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root
    + However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms
    + Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root

* **Connection**  
    + __CRL1~ARL1__, __QHB__, [Identification of CROWN ROOTLESS1-regulated genes in rice reveals specific and conserved elements of postembryonic root formation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of CROWN ROOTLESS1-regulated genes in rice reveals specific and conserved elements of postembryonic root formation.%5BTitle%5D), We show that CRL1 positively regulates 277 genes, including key genes involved in meristem patterning (such as QUIESCENT-CENTER SPECIFIC HOMEOBOX; QHB), cell proliferation and hormone homeostasis
