## Key message
1. __crown__, [Isolation and characterization of a rice WUSCHEL-type homeobox gene that is specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center in the root apical meristem](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a rice WUSCHEL-type homeobox gene that is specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center in the root apical meristem%5BTitle%5D),  During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root

## Connection
