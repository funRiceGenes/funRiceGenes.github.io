* **Key message**  
    + In the previous study, we identified a cold-tolerant QTL at the seedling stage, qCTS-9 which could be detected under different cold environments using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cold-tolerant variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) and a cold-sensitive variety Shanhuangzhan 2 (SHZ-2)
    + Identification of the functional gene underlying qCTS-9 and development of the gene-specific marker will facilitate molecular breeding for cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice through transgenic approach and marker-assisted selection (MAS)
