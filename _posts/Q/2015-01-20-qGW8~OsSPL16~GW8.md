## Key message
1. __grain quality__, [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield
2. __grain size__, [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield
