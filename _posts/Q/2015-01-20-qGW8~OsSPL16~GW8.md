* **Key message**  
    + We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield
    + Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice
    + Programmed Editing of Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) OsSPL16 Gene Using CRISPR/Cas9 Improves Grain Yield by Modulating the Expression of Pyruvate Enzymes and Cell Cycle Proteins
    + Thus, the overall results revealed that CRISPR/Cas9-guided OsSPL16 mutations have the potential to boost the grain yield of rice
