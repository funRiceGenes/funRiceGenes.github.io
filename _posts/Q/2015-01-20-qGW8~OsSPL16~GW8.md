* **Information**  
    + Symbol: qGW8,OsSPL16,GW8  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os08g41940](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g41940)  
    + RAPdb: [Os08g0531600](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os08g0531600)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2012, Nat Genet.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AK109469](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK109469)

* **Key message**  
    + We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield
    + Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __GW7~GL7~SLG7__, __qGW8~OsSPL16~GW8__, [The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.%5BTitle%5D), OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
    + __OsMADS34~PAP2__, __qGW8~OsSPL16~GW8__, [Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
