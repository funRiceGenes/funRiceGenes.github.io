* **Key message**  
    + qSOR1 is negatively regulated by auxin, predominantly expressed in root columella cells, and involved in the gravitropic responses of roots
    + Here, we have demonstrated, through the cloning and characterization of qSOR1 (quantitative trait locus for SOIL SURFACE ROOTING 1), that a shallower root growth angle (RGA) could enhance rice yields in saline paddies

* **Connection**  
    + __DRO1__, __qSOR1__, [Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields%5BTitle%5D),  qSOR1 was found to be a homolog of DRO1 (DEEPER ROOTING 1), which is known to control RGA
    + __DRO1__, __qSOR1__, [Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Root angle modifications by the DRO1 homolog improve rice yields in saline paddy fields%5BTitle%5D),  Introgression lines with combinations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function alleles in qSOR1 and DRO1 demonstrated four different RSAs (ultra-shallow, shallow, intermediate, and deep rooting), suggesting that natural alleles of the DRO1 homologs could be utilized to control RSA variations in rice
