* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, we isolated OsHMA3, a gene encoding a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter from Jarjan
    + * In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates
    + * The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter
    + * We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating rice plants has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of OsHMA3-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles
    + OsHMA3, a P1B-type of ATPase affects root-to-shoot cadmium translocation in rice by mediating efflux into vacuoles
    + Our results indicated that OsHMA3 from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar limits translocation of Cd from the roots to the above-ground tissues by selectively sequestrating Cd into the root vacuoles
    + Rice OsHMA3 is a vacuolar cadmium (Cd) transporter belonging to the P1B-ATPase family and has a long (273aa) C-terminal region
    + Functional analysis of the C-terminal region of the vacuolar cadmium-transporting rice OsHMA3
    + The OsHMA3 protein was localized in all roots cells, but the sequence has a mutation leading to loss of function
    + Therefore, failure to sequester Cd into the root vacuoles by OsHMA3 is probably responsible for high Cd accumulation in Jarjan
    + Overexpression of OsHMA3 selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain
    + Taken together, overexpression of OsHMA3 is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice
    + As a member of the heavy metal ATPase (HMA) family, OsHMA3 is a tonoplast-localized transporter for Cd in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.
    + Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of OsHMA3 also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd
    + A loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 associated with high cadmium accumulation in shoots and grain of Japonica rice cultivars.
    + Our study has identified a new loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 in Japonica rice cultivars leading to high Cd accumulation in shoots and grain
    + Furthermore, OsHMA3 protein was detected in the root pericycle cells and phloem region of both the diffuse vascular bundle and the enlarged vascular bundle of the nodes
    + Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.
    + These results indicate that expression of OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues
    + We found that the two GCC7 alleles, GCC7PA64s and GCC793-11 , had different promoter activity of OsHMA3, leading to different OsHMA3 expression and different shoot and grain Cd concentrations
    + Natural variation in the promoter of OsHMA3 contributes to differential grain cadmium accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice.
    + Our results thus reveal that the QTL GCC7 with sequence variation in the OsHMA3 promoter is an important determinant controlling differential grain Cd accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice
    + Taken together, we have identified a new allele of OsHMA3 with a total loss of function, resulting in a greatly elevated Cd translocation to the shoots and grain of rice
    + Map-based cloning of a new total loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 causing high cadmium accumulation in rice grain.
    + By comparing rice accessions with functional allele of OsHMA3 with accessions with loss of function allele of OsHMA3, we found that accessions with functional OsHMA3 showed higher tolerance to high Zn than those with non-functional OsHMA3 based on root elongation test
    + When exposed to Zn-free solution, the Zn concentration in the root cell sap was rapidly decreased in the accessions with functional OsHMA3, but less changed in the accessions with non-functional OsHMA3
    + A tonoplast-localized OsHMA3 plays an important role in maintaining Zn homeostasis in rice.
    + Comprehensive analysis of variation of cadmium accumulation in rice and detection of a new weak allele of OsHMA3
