* **Key message**  
    + During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root
    + However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms
    + Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root
    + Thus, our findings provide new insights into the role of rice WOX gene family in rice development and salt tolerance, and suggest that OsQHB is a valuable target for improving rice production in environments characterized by salt stress
    + Mutation in OsQHB led to a decrease in plant height, tiller number, panicle length, grain length and grain width, and an increase in salt tolerance
    + OsQHB Improves Salt Tolerance by Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species in Rice.
    + Moreover, the osqhb mutants have higher ROS-scavenging enzymes activities and lower accumulation of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) under salt stress
    + Transcriptome and qPCR analysis showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging-related genes were regulated by OsQHB
    + The function of WOX5 in enhancing cytokinin-dependent shoot regeneration is evolutionarily conserved, as conditional overexpression of OsWOX5 on SIM profoundly enhanced shoot regeneration in rice callus
