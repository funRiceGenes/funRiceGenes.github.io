* **Key message**  
    + Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
    + We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation
    + Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.
    + Special interest was the detection of the most significant association SNP, sf0136352825, which was less than 95 kb from the seed shattering gene qSH1
    + In addition, both RI and RIL1 seem to be involved in meristem maintenance, because the ri ril1 double mutant failed to establish or maintain the shoot apical meristem during embryogenesis
