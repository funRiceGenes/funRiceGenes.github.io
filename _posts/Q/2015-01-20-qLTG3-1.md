4. __seed germination__, [Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by qLTG3-1 controlling low-temperature germinability in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by qLTG3-1 controlling low-temperature germinability in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Most of these genes might be involved in the process of seed germination itself, and then a focus was made on qLTG3-1 dependently induced or suppressed genes, defined as 'qLTG3-1 dependent' genes
5. __homeostasis__, [Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by qLTG3-1 controlling low-temperature germinability in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by qLTG3-1 controlling low-temperature germinability in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Twenty-nine 'qLTG3-1 dependent' genes with diverse functions were categorized, implying that disruption of cellular homeostasis leads to a wide range of metabolic alterations and diverse cross-talk between various signaling pathways
6. __seed__, [Molecular identification of a major quantitative trait locus, qLTG3-1, controlling low-temperature germinability in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular identification of a major quantitative trait locus, qLTG3-1, controlling low-temperature germinability in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The QTL qLTG3-1 is strongly expressed in the embryo during seed germination
