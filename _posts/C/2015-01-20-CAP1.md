* **Key message**  
    + The cap1 heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains
    + A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains
    + Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate
    + Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
    + During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage
    + We isolated a pollen-defective mutant, collapsed abnormal pollen1 (cap1), from Tos17 insertional mutant lines of rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Our results suggested that CAP1 and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
