## Key message
1. __grain__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The cap1 heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains
2. __grain__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains
3. __cell wall__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate
4. __growth__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
5. __anther__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage
6. __pollen__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated a pollen-defective mutant, collapsed abnormal pollen1 (cap1), from Tos17 insertional mutant lines of rice (Oryza sativa)
7. __pollen__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains
8. __pollen__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage

10. __pollen__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggested that CAP1 and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
11. __vegetative__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
