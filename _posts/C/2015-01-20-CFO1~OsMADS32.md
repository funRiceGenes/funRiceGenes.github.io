* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we characterized a MIKC-type MADS box gene, CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS (CFO1), which plays a key role in the regulation of floral organ identity in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + The cfo1 mutant displayed defective marginal regions of the palea, chimeric floral organs, and ectopic floral organs
    + The expression domains of CFO1 were mainly restricted to the marginal region of the palea and inner floral organs
    + The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers
    + Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers
    + We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression
    + OsMADS32 interacts with PI-like proteins and regulates rice flower development.
    + OsMADS32 is a monocot specific MIKC(c) type MADS-box gene that plays an important role in regulating rice floral meristem and organs identity, a crucial process for reproductive success and rice yield
    + This work provides new insight into the mechanism by which OsMADS32 regulates rice lodicule and stamen identity, by interaction with two PI-like proteins via its K domain
    + OsMADS32 interacts with PI-like proteins and regulates rice flower development
    + We show here that the rice homeotic transcription factor OsMADS32 regulates floral patterning by interacting synergistically with E class protein OsMADS6 in a dosage-dependent manner
    + Furthermore, our results indicate important roles of OsMADS32 in defining stamen, pistil and ovule development through physical and genetic interactions with OsMADS1, OsMADS58 and OsMADS13, and in specifying floral meristem identity with OsMADS6, OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 respectively
    + Our findings suggest that OsMADS32 is an important factor for floral meristem identity maintenance and that it integrates the action of other MADS-box homeotic proteins to sustain floral organ specification and development in rice
    + Given that OsMADS32 is an orphan gene and absent in eudicots, our data substantially expand our understanding of flower development in plants
    + OsMADS32 Regulates Rice Floral Patterning through Interactions with Multiple Floral Homeotic Genes
    + Our data suggest, OsMADS1 commits and maintains determinate floret development by regulating floral meristem termination, carpel and ovule differentiation genes (OsMADS58, OsMADS13) while its modulation of genes such as OsMADS15, OsIG1 and OsMADS32 could be relevant in the differentiation and development of palea
