* **Key message**  
    + In rice, the chalcone synthase mutant oschs1 produces flavonoid-depleted pollens and is male sterile
    + Our findings reveal a new mechanism that OsCHS1 modulates starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism through modulating the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids which affects α-amylase activity to maintain PT penetration in rice, which contributes to a better understanding of the function of CHS1 in crop fertility and breeding
    + Further analysis showed that loss of OsCHS1 function disrupted the homeostasis of flavonoid and triterpenoid metabolism and led to the accumulation of triterpenoid, which inhibits significantly α-amylase activity, amyloplast hydrolysis and monosaccharide content in xt6, these ultimately impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reduced ATP content and lowered the turgor pressure as well
