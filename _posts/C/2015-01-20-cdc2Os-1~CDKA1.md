## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants%5BTitle%5D),  cdc2Os-1 could complement a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant of cdc28

## Connection
