## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
2. __transcription factor__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression
3. __chloroplast__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Coexpression, microarray, and real-time expression analyses demonstrate a correlation between Cga1 expression and the expression of important nucleus-encoded, chloroplast-localized genes
4. __chloroplast__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
5. __chloroplast__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index
6. __chloroplast__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate a conserved mechanism by which Cga1 regulates chloroplast development in higher plants
7. __senescence__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
8. __dwarf__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
9. __biomass__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index
10. __starch__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
11. __tillering__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
12. __cytokinin__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression
13. __grain filling__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
14. __grain__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
15. __gibberellin__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression
