* **Key message**  
    + We previously identified two closely linked quantitative trait loci, Ctb1 and Ctb2, for cold tolerance at the booting stage of Norin-PL8 in the long arm of chromosome 4
    + A comparison of the degrees of cold tolerance of the NILs indicated that Ctb1 is located in the 56-kb region covered by a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, OSJNBa0058 K23, that had been sequenced by the International Rice Genome Sequence Project
    + We were also able to show that Ctb1 is likely to be associated with anther length, which is one of major factors in cold tolerance at the booting stage
    + Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice
    + We previously mapped a quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance, Ctb1, to a 56-kb region containing 7 putative genes
    + Map-based cloning of the rice cold tolerance gene Ctb1
