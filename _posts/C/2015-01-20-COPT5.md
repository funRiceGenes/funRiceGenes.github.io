## Connection
1. __COPT1__, __COPT5__, [Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport
2. __COPT1__, __COPT5__, [Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and COPT5
