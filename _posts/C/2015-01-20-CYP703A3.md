## Key message
1. __ ga __, [Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation
2. __tapetal__, [Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB%5BTitle%5D),  Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation
