* **Key message**  
    + CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
    + Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation
    + We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes

    + __CRC1__, __OsMTOPVIB__, [OsMTOPVIB is required for meiotic bipolar spindle assembly.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMTOPVIB is required for meiotic bipolar spindle assembly.%5BTitle%5D),  We further revealed that the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores was prevalent in OsmtopVIB, whereas biorientation of sister kinetochores was frequently observed in Osspo11-1, pair2, and crc1 In addition, mutations of the cohesion subunit OsREC8 resulted in biorientation of sister kinetochores as well as bipolar spindles even in the background of OsmtopVIB Therefore, we propose that biorientation of the kinetochore is required for bipolar spindle assembly in the absence of homologous recombination
