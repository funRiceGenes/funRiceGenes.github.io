* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Analysis of pCRR1::GUS transgenic plants showed that CRR1 was specifically expressed in vascular bundle cells
    + Furthermore, a small portion of cells in the vascular bundles of crr1 showed defective cell wall formation, and callose deposition was specifically reduced at the plasmodesmata (PD) of cells with aberrant walls
    + Map-based cloning revealed that CRR1 encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis callose synthases AtGSL8 and AtGSL10
