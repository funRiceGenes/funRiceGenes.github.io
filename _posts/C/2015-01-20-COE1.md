* **Key message**  
    + COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane
    + Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation
    + Brassinolide, an active brassinosteroid, decreased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, and brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, increased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, but coe1 mutants showed insensitivity to these chemicals
    + These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals
