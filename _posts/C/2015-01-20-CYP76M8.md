    + __CYP76M6__, __CYP76M8__, [Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), In particular, CYP76M5, CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 were all shown to carry out C-7beta hydroxylation, whereas CYP701A8 catalyses C-3alpha hydroxylation, with oxy groups found at both positions in oryzalexins A-D, suggesting that these may act consecutively in oryzalexin biosynthesis
    + __CYP76M6__, __CYP76M8__, [Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), In the present paper, we report that, although CYP701A8 only poorly reacts with 7beta-hydroxy-ent-sandaracopimaradiene, CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 readily react with 3alpha-hydroxy-ent-sandaracopimaradiene
    + __CYP76M6__, __CYP76M8__, [Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), Notably, their activity yields distinct products, resulting from hydroxylation at C-9beta by CYP76M6 or C-7beta by CYP76M8, on different sides of the core tricyclic ring structure
    + __CYP76M6__, __CYP76M8__, [Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), Thus CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 have distinct non-redundant roles in orzyalexin biosynthesis
