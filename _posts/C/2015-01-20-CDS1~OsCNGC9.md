* **Key message**  
    + We show that OsCNGC9 mediates PAMP-induced Ca2+ influx and that this event is critical for PAMPs-triggered ROS burst and induction of PTI-related defense gene expression
    + We further show that a PTI-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185 physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsCNGC9 to activate its channel activity
    + In addition, transcription of OsCNGC9 is activated by a rice dehydration responsive element binding transcription factor, OsDREB1A
    + Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice
    + We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance
    + Together, our results suggested that OsCNGC9 enhances chilling tolerance in rice through regulating cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation
    + Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx
