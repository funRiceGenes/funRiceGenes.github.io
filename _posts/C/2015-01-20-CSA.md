* **Key message**  
    + Our findings suggest that CSA is a key transcriptional regulator for sugar partitioning in rice during male reproductive development
    + Here, we describe a photoperiod-controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (csa), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development
    + We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (csa), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs
    + The csa-based photoperiod-sensitive male sterile line allows the establishment of a stable two-line hybrid system, which promises to have a significant impact on agriculture
    + Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production
    + CSA was isolated by map-based cloning and was shown to encode an R2R3 MYB transcription factor that was expressed preferentially in the anther tapetal cells and in the sugar-transporting vascular tissues
    + In particular, the csa mutant had reduced levels of carbohydrates in later anthers and was male sterile
    + In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers
    + Furthermore, F(1) plants of csa and a restorer line JP69 exhibited heterosis (hybrid vigor), suggesting the feasibility of using this mutation to create hybrid rice
    + The csa mutant had reduced accumulation of (14)C-labeled sugars in anther sink tissue
    + Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
    + Several hub genes coordinating the effects of CSA regulation were identified as critical elements determining WT male fertility and further analysis of these and related genes will reveal insights into how CSA coordinates sugar metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and photoperiod sensing in rice anther development
    + CSA played a critical role in regulating sugar metabolism and cell wall synthesis in anthers under short-day conditions, and transcription of key genes inducing csa-directed sterility was upregulated under long-day (LD) conditions though not to WT levels, revealing a mechanism to explain the partial restoration of fertility in rice under LD conditions
    + Eight direct targets of CSA regulation were identified, all of which were genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport (cell wall invertases, SWEETs, and monosaccharide transporters) expressed only in reproductive tissues
