## Expression information
__Expression__:Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein. |  Here, we show that a phytohormone, the brassinosteroids (BRs) promotes pollen and seed development in rice by directly promoting expression of Carbon Starved Anther (CSA) which encodes a MYB domain protein |  Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
