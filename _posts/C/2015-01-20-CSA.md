* **Key message**  
    + Our findings suggest that CSA is a key transcriptional regulator for sugar partitioning in rice during male reproductive development
    + Here, we describe a photoperiod-controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (csa), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development
    + We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (csa), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs
    + The csa-based photoperiod-sensitive male sterile line allows the establishment of a stable two-line hybrid system, which promises to have a significant impact on agriculture
    + Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production
    + CSA was isolated by map-based cloning and was shown to encode an R2R3 MYB transcription factor that was expressed preferentially in the anther tapetal cells and in the sugar-transporting vascular tissues
    + In particular, the csa mutant had reduced levels of carbohydrates in later anthers and was male sterile
    + In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers
    + Furthermore, F(1) plants of csa and a restorer line JP69 exhibited heterosis (hybrid vigor), suggesting the feasibility of using this mutation to create hybrid rice
    + The csa mutant had reduced accumulation of (14)C-labeled sugars in anther sink tissue
    + Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
