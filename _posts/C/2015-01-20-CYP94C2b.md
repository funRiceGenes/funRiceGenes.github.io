## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Here we report that increased expression of the Cyt P450 family gene CYP94C2b enhanced viability of rice plants under saline conditions |  Inactivation of JA was facilitated in a rice line with enhanced CYP94C2b expression, and responses to exogenous JA and wounding were alleviated  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
