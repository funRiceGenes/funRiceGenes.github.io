## Key message
1. __flower__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the pps-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in pps-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway
2. __flower__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots
3. __reproductive__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D), The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice
4. __reproductive__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood
5. __reproductive__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D), Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth
6. __panicle__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles
7. __panicle__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles
8. __inflorescence__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles
9. __vegetative__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots
10. __vegetative__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D), The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice
11. __ ga __, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  Double mutant d18-k pps-1 showed the same phenotype as the pps-1, indicating that PPS is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes
12. __growth__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D), Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth
13. __leaf__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  In the ninth leaf blade of pps-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type
14. __meristem__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles
15. __ ga __, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The pps-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA3 content in this mutant
16. __flowering time__, [Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth%5BTitle%5D),  Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood
17. __vegetative__, [The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice%5BTitle%5D), The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice
