* **Key message**  
    + In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the pps-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in pps-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway
    + Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots
    + The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice
    + Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood
    + Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth
    + Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles
    + These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles
    + Double mutant (d18-k pps-1) showed the same phenotype as the pps-1, indicating that PPS is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes
    + In the ninth leaf blade of pps-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type
    + The pps-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA(3) content in this mutant
    + The rice peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) mutant shows a prolonged juvenile phase and early flowering
