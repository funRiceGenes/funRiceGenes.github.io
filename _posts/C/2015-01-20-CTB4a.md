    + Symbol: CTB4a  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os04g04330](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g04330)

* **Publication**  
    + [Natural variation in CTB4a enhances rice adaptation to cold habitats.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Natural variation in CTB4a enhances rice adaptation to cold habitats.%5BTitle%5D), 2017, Nat Commun.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We show that different CTB4a alleles confer distinct levels of cold tolerance and selection for variation in the CTB4a promoter region has occurred on the basis of environmental temperature
    + Upregulation of CTB4a correlates with increased ATP synthase activity, ATP content, enhanced seed setting and improved yield under cold stress conditions
    + Here we explored a QTL for cold tolerance and cloned the gene, CTB4a (cold tolerance at booting stage), encoding a conserved leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase
