* **Key message**  
    + In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs
    + In Arabidopsis, four A2-type cyclins (CYCA2s) function redundantly in regulating CDKB1 activity to promote the asymmetric division for stomatal initiation and the symmetric division of guard mother cells (GMCs)
    + Cross-species complementation tests demonstrated that OsCYCA2;1 and OsCDKB1;1 could complement the defective stomatal phenotypes of Arabidopsis cyca2 and cdkb1 mutants, but also could suppress DNA endoduplication and cell enlargement
    + Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp
    + Disturbing the expression of OsCDKB1;1 remarkably enhanced the tolerance to salt stress
    + Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice
