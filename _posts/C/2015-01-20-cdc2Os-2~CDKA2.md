    + __cdc2Os-1~CDKA1__, __cdc2Os-2~CDKA2__, [Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants%5BTitle%5D), Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2 showed that they are 83% identical
    + __cdc2Os-1~CDKA1__, __cdc2Os-2~CDKA2__, [Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants%5BTitle%5D), Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome
