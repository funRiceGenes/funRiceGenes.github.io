* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, termed crown rootless5 (crl5), which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia
    + The expression of CRL5, which encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family protein, was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation occurs
    + A putative auxin response element in the CRL5 promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that CRL5 may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation
    + A crl1 crl5 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation
    + In addition, ProACT:CRL5/WT showed a cytokinin-resistant phenotype for crown root initiation, and also up-regulated the expression of two negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, OsRR1 and OsRR2, which were downregulated in crl5
    + Transgenic plants that over-expressed OsRR1 under the control of the CRL5 promoter in a crl5 mutant background produced a higher number of crown roots than the crl5 plant
    + Taken together, these results indicate that auxin-induced CRL5 promotes crown root initiation through repression of cytokinin signaling by positively regulating type-A RR, OsRR1
    + We have demonstrated that auxin-induced CROWN ROOTLESS5 (CRL5) regulates crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a negative regulator of cytokinin signaling
    + A radicle initiated normally in a crl5 mutant, in spite of the defect in crown root initiation, whereas crown roots, but not a radicle, were produced in a radicleless1 (ral1) mutant
    + Exogenous auxin treatment induced CRL5 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, which also required the degradation of AUX/IAA proteins
    + CRL5 overexpressing calli formed adventitious roots, although CRL5 overexpressing plants did not induce ectopic roots, suggesting that CRL5, which promotes de novo root initiation, might function only in de-differentiated cells
    + A crl5 ral1 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, showing that the formation of each root is regulated by different genetic mechanisms in rice
