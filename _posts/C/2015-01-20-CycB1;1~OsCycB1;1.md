* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsCycB1;1 was also enhanced
    + We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2
    + These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress
    + Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo
    + The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm
    + Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice
    + The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice
    + In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo
