## Key message
1. __cold stress__, [Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes%5BTitle%5D)), " Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsCycB1;1 was also enhanced"
2. __mitosis__, [Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2
3. __chilling__, [Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress
4. __cell cycle__, [Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress
5. __endosperm__, [The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo
6. __endosperm__, [The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm
7. __endosperm__, [The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice
8. __endosperm__, [The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice
9. __seed__, [The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo

5. __CycB1;1~OsCycB1;1__, __OsMYB3R-2__, [Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress
6. __CycB1;1~OsCycB1;1__, __OsAUX1__, [The auxin transporter, OsAUX1, is involved in primary root and root hair elongation and in Cd stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The auxin transporter, OsAUX1, is involved in primary root and root hair elongation and in Cd stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), Decreased auxin distribution and contents in osaux1 mutant result in reduction of OsCyCB1;1 expression and shortened PR, LR and RH under Cd  stress, but can be rescued by the membrane-permeable auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA)
