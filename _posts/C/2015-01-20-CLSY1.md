* **Key message**  
    + We propose that truncation of the CLSY1 gene in rice may alter the RNA-guided DNA methylation pathway that leads to enhanced plant height in flooded environments due to changes in methylation profiles and overall changes in gene expression.
    + We identified a gene regulatory pathway that influences the AG trait through RdDm processes and determined that the CLSY1 gene contributes to the capacity of rice to germinate under anaerobic conditions.
    + We propose that a mutation in the CLSY1 gene in rice influences the RdDm pathway leading to changes in methylation profiles and gene expression patterns, causing enhanced survival of seeds under anoxia and greater seedling establishment in flooded environments.
