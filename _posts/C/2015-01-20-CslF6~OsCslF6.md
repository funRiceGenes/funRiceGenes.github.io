* **Key message**  
    + Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development
    + The data presented here indicate that the loss of MLG in CslF6 plants had an impact on gm and demonstrate the importance of cell wall effective porosity and liquid path length on gm
    + OsMYC2, a master transcription factor of jasmonate signalling, directly controlled the upregulation of OsCslF6 in response to BPH feeding
    + Overexpressing OsCslF6, which encodes a glucan synthase that catalyses MLG biosynthesis, significantly enhanced BPH resistance and cell wall thickness in vascular bundles, whereas knockout of OsCslF6 reduced BPH resistance and vascular wall thickness
    + The AT-rich domain of the OsCslF6 promoter varies in rice varieties from different locations and natural variants in this domain were associated with BPH resistance
