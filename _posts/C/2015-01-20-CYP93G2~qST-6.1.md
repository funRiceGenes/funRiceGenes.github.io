* **Key message**  
    + Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield

* **Connection**  
    + __CYP93G2~qST-6.1__, __OsCGT__, [CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D), Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form
    + __CYP93G2~qST-6.1__, __OsCGT__, [CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D), Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta
    + __CYP93G1~OsFNSII__, __CYP93G2~qST-6.1__, [Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones
