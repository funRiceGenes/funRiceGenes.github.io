* **Publication**  
    + [CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2019, Plant J.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + CRD1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels in the crown root primordium at the stem base
    + The altered crown root phenotype of crd1 was simulated by target mimicry of miR156, suggesting that this defect is due to the disruption of miR156 regulatory pathways
    + The crd1 mutant contains significantly reduced miRNA levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that CRD1 is essential for maintaining normal miRNA levels in plant cells
