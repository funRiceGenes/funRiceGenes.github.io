* **Key message**  
    + The CC motif has been detected in rice COPT1, COPT2, and COPT5 and CxC motif in rice COPT6 and COPT7 at the C-termini (Figure <U+200B>(Figure22).
    + Zn deficiency induced COPT1, COPT5, and COPT7 and slightly suppressed COPT4 in root and induced COPT5, COPT6, and COPT7 in shoot.
    + Overexpressing COPT1 or COPT5 or suppressing COPT1 or COPT5 in rice had no influence on Fe, Mn, and Zn contents in rice shoot
    + Rice COPT1, COPT5, and XA13 cooperate to promote removal of Cu from rice xylem vessels, where Xoo multiplies and spreads to cause disease
    + Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription.
