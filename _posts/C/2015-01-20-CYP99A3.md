5. __CYP99A3__, __OsTGAP1~OsbZIP37__, [OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
6. __CYP99A2__, __CYP99A3__, [CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Strikingly, the rice genome contains a biosynthetic gene cluster for momilactone production, located on rice chromosome 4, which contains two cytochrome P450 CYP mono-oxygenases, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, with undefined roles; although it has been previously shown that RNA interference double knock-down of this pair of closely related CYPs reduced momilactone accumulation
7. __CYP99A2__, __CYP99A3__, [CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we attempted biochemical characterization of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, which was ultimately achieved by complete gene recoding, enabling functional recombinant expression in bacteria
8. __CYP99A2__, __CYP99A3__, [CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice%5BTitle%5D),  With these synthetic gene constructs it was possible to demonstrate that while CYP99A2 does not exhibit significant activity with diterpene substrates, CYP99A3 catalyzes consecutive oxidations of the C19 methyl group of the momilactone precursor syn-pimara-7,15-diene to form, sequentially, syn-pimaradien-19-ol, syn-pimaradien-19-al, and syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid
