## Connection
1. __CysR10~crP10__, __PDIL2;3__, [Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  PDIL2;3 knockdown inhibited the accumulation of Cys-rich 10-kD prolamin (crP10) in the core of PB-I
2. __CysR10~crP10__, __PDIL2;3__, [Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, crP10 knockdown dispersed PDIL2;3 into the ER lumen
3. __CysR10~crP10__, __PDIL2;3__, [Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We discuss PDIL2;3-dependent and PDIL2;3-independent oxidation pathways that sustain disulfide bonds of crP10 in PB-I
