* **Key message**  
    + COG2 encodes a cell wall-localized extensin and affects the compositions of cell wall, including pectin and cellulose, to defense the chilling stress
    + COG2 negatively regulates chilling tolerance through cell wall components altered in rice
    + Chilling-tolerant QTL gene COG2 encoded an extensin and repressed chilling tolerance by affecting the compositions of cell wall
    + COG2 overexpression transgenic plants are sensitive to cold, whereas knockout transgenic lines enhance chilling tolerance
