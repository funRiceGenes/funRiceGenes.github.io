* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII
    + Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield
