* **Key message**  
    + Northern and immunoblot analysis showed increased expression of CRT and CRTintP in response to cold stress
    + Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-CRT antibodies confirmed the existence of the CRT-CRTintP complex in vivo in the stressed leaf tissue, suggesting their potential role in regulating stress response
