## Expression information

## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice
2. __ xoo __, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that C3H12, as a nucleic acid-binding protein, positively and quantitatively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and that its function is likely associated with the JA-dependent pathway
3. __disease resistance__, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12
4. __disease__, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12
5. __ ja __, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice
6. __ ja __, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  In contrast, knockout or suppression of C3H12 resulted in partially increased susceptibility to Xoo, accompanied by decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes in rice
7. __jasmonic acid__, [A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease%5BTitle%5D),  Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice
