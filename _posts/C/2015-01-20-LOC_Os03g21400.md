* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice
    + These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice
    + Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism
    + Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro
    + CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice
