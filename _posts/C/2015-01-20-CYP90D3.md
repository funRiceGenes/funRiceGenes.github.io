* **Key message**  
    + However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies
    + We report the biochemical characterization of two brassinosteroid-biosynthetic P450s from rice: CYP90D2 and CYP90D3
    + These results indicate that CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 can act as brassinosteroid C-23 hydroxylases in rice
