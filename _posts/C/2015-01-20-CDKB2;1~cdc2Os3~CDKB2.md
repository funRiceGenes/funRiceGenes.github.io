## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices
2. __mitosis__, [CDKB2 is involved in mitosis and DNA damage response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CDKB2 is involved in mitosis and DNA damage response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, polyploid cells due to endomitosis were present in CDKB2;1 knockdown rice, suggesting an important role for Orysa;CDKB2;1 during mitosis

## Connection
1. __CDKB2;1~cdc2Os3~CDKB2__, __R2__, [Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices
