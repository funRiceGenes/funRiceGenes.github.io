    + [Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Front Plant Sci.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + A promoter-GUS assay revealed that CAL2 is expressed in root tips
    + Heterologous expression of CAL2 enhanced Cd sensitivity in Arabidopsis, whereas overexpression of CAL2 had no effect on Cd tolerance in rice
    + Stable expression of the CAL2-mRFP fusion protein indicated that CAL2 is also localized in the cell walls
    + Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.

* **Connection**  
    + __CAL2__, __OsDEF7~CAL1~OsAFP1__, [Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.%5BTitle%5D),  CAL2 shared 66% similarity with CAL1, and its mRNA accumulation is mainly observed in roots and is unaffected by Cd stress, but its transcription level was lower than that of CAL1 based on the relative expression of CAL2/Actin1 observed in this study and that reported previously
