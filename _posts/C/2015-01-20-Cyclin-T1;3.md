## Key message
1. __grain size__, [The novel quantitative trait locus GL3.1 controls rice grain size and yield by regulating Cyclin-T1;3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel quantitative trait locus GL3.1 controls rice grain size and yield by regulating Cyclin-T1;3%5BTitle%5D)),  Our findings suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of grain size and yield that is driven through a novel phosphatase-mediated process that affects the phosphorylation of Cyclin-T1;3 during cell cycle progression, and thus provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying crop seed development
