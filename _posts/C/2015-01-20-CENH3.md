    + __CENH3__, __LEPTO1~OsRR24__, [The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.%5BTitle%5D),  Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs
