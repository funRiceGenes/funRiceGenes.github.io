* **Key message**  
    + We propose that PAL, COMT, and GSTU17 are likely to confer PBZ-induced disease resistance via such functions as biosynthesis and transport of flavonoid-type phytoalexin and/or lignin biogenesis
    + Similar to AtCOMT, OsCOMT was localized in the cytoplasm
    + Melatonin biosynthesis requires N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase activity of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in rice
    + OsCAldOMT1 is a bifunctional O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of tricin-lignins in rice cell walls.
    + These data establish OsCAldOMT1 as a bifunctional O-methyltransferase predominantly involved in the two parallel metabolic pathways both dedicated to the biosynthesis of tricin-lignins in rice cell walls
    + Transgenic assays suggested that OsCOMT significantly delays leaf senescence at the grain filling stage by inhibiting degradation of chlorophyll and chloroplast, which, in turn, improves photosynthesis efficiency
    + In addition, the number and size of vascular bundles in the culms and leaves were significantly increased in the OsCOMT-overexpressing plants, while decreased in the knockout plants, suggesting that OsCOMT plays a positive role in vascular development of rice
    + More importantly, we found that OsCOMT is a positive regulator of grain yield, and overexpression of OsCOMT increase grain yield per plant even in a high-yield variety background, suggesting that OsCOMT can be used as an important target for enhancing rice yield
    + In vitro and inâ€‰vivo evidence revealed that OsCOMT is involved in melatonin biosynthesis
