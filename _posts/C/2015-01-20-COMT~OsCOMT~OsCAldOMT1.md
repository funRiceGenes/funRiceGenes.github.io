* **Key message**  
    + We propose that PAL, COMT, and GSTU17 are likely to confer PBZ-induced disease resistance via such functions as biosynthesis and transport of flavonoid-type phytoalexin and/or lignin biogenesis
    + Similar to AtCOMT, OsCOMT was localized in the cytoplasm
    + Melatonin biosynthesis requires N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase activity of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in rice
    + OsCAldOMT1 is a bifunctional O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of tricin-lignins in rice cell walls.
    + These data establish OsCAldOMT1 as a bifunctional O-methyltransferase predominantly involved in the two parallel metabolic pathways both dedicated to the biosynthesis of tricin-lignins in rice cell walls
