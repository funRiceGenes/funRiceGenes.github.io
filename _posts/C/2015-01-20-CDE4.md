* **Key message**  
    + CDE4 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in chloroplast RNA splicing and affects chloroplast development under low-temperature conditions in rice
    + CDE4 directly binds to the transcripts of the chloroplast genes rpl2, ndhA, and ndhB
    + Our results suggest that CDE4 participates in plastid RNA splicing and plays an important role in rice chloroplast development under low-temperature conditions
    + Positional cloning revealed that CDE4 encodes a P-type PPR protein localized in chloroplasts
    + Moreover, CDE4 interacts with the guanylate kinase VIRESCENT 2 (V2); overexpression of V2 enhanced CDE4 protein stability, thereby rescuing the cde4 phenotype at 20°C
