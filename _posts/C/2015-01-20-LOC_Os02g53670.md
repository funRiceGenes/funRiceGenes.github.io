* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsTRFL1 is an essential factor for the proper maintenance of telomeres and normal development of rice
    + The reduced levels of OsTRFL1 caused serious developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive organs of rice plants
    + T-DNA inserted OsTRFL1 knock-out mutant rice plants displayed significantly longer telomeres (6-25 kb) than those (5-12 kb) in wild-type plants, indicating that OsTRFL1 is a negative factor for telomere lengthening
    + In this study, we identified and characterized OsTRFL1 (Oryza sativa Telomere Repeat-binding Factor Like 1) in rice, a monocot model crop
