## Connection
1. __Cht-2__, __Cht-3__, [Enhanced resistance to blast (Magnaporthe grisea) in transgenic Japonica rice by constitutive expression of rice chitinase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced resistance to blast (Magnaporthe grisea) in transgenic Japonica rice by constitutive expression of rice chitinase%5BTitle%5D),  By an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method, we reintroduced a rice class-I chitinase gene, Cht-2 or Cht-3, under the control of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter and a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, as a selection marker into the Japonica rice varieties Nipponbare and Koshihikari, which have retained the best popularity over a long period in Japan
2. __Cht-2__, __Cht-3__, [Enhanced resistance to blast (Magnaporthe grisea) in transgenic Japonica rice by constitutive expression of rice chitinase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Enhanced resistance to blast (Magnaporthe grisea) in transgenic Japonica rice by constitutive expression of rice chitinase%5BTitle%5D),  In regenerated plants (R(0), the Cht-2 product was found to accumulate intracellularly whereas the Cht-3 product was found to be targeted extracellularly
