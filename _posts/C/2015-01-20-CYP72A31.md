* **Information**  
    + Symbol: CYP72A31  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os01g41800](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g41800)  
    + RAPdb: [Os01g0602200](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os01g0602200)  

* **Publication**  
    + [A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Thus, the CYP72A31 gene is a potentially useful genetic resource in the field of weed control, herbicide development, and molecular breeding in broad range of crop species

* **Connection**  
    + __bel~CYP81A6~bsl__, __CYP72A31__, [A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, Arabidopsis overexpressing CYP72A31 showed tolerance to bensulfuron-methyl (BSM), which belongs to a different class of ALS-inhibiting herbicides, suggesting that CYP72A31 can metabolize BS and BSM to a compound with reduced phytotoxicity
    + __bel~CYP81A6~bsl__, __CYP72A31__, [A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D),  On the other hand, we showed that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81A6, which has been reported to confer BSM tolerance, is barely involved, if at all, in BS tolerance, suggesting that the CYP72A31 enzyme has different herbicide specificities compared to CYP81A6
