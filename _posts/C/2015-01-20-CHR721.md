* **Key message**  
    + CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice
    + CHR721 was found to interact with replication protein A (OsRPA1a), which is involved in DNA repair
    + The expressions of genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints were consistently upregulated in chr721
