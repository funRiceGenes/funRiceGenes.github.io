* **Key message**  
    + In addition to its role in forming lateral meristems, the wild-type LAX1 gene acts as a floral meristem identity gene which specifies the terminal spikelet meristem
    + LAX1 mRNA accumulates in two to three layers of cells in the boundary region between the initiating AM and the shoot apical meristem
    + In lax1 mutants, the proliferation of meristematic cells is initiated but fails to progress into the formation of AM
    + In situ hybridization analysis using OSH1, a rice knotted1 (kn1) ortholog, confirmed the absence of lateral meristems in lax1-2 panicles
    + These defects indicate that the LAX1 gene is required for the initiation/maintenance of axillary meristems in the rice panicle
    + A comparison of the defects in lax1-1 and lax1-2 plants suggested that the sensitivities to reduced LAX1 activity were not uniform among different types of meristems
    + The LAX1 and FRIZZY PANICLE 2 genes determine the inflorescence architecture of rice by controlling rachis-branch and spikelet development
    + In lax1-2, which is a new and stronger allele of the previously reported lax mutant, initiation and/or maintenance of rachis-branches, lateral spikelets, and terminal spikelets was severely prevented
    + In rice (Oryza sativa), LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) function is required for the generation of AM throughout the plant's lifespan
    + The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage
    + The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching

    + __Gnp4~LAX2__, __LAX1__, [LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems%5BTitle%5D), We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation
