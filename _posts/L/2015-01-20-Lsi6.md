* **Key message**  
    + Lsi6 is expressed in the leaf sheath and leaf blades as well as in the root tips
    + Knockdown of Lsi6 did not affect the uptake of Si by the roots but resulted in disordered deposition of silica in the shoots and increased excretion of Si in the guttation fluid
    + Lsi6 is a silicon transporter in rice (Oryza sativa), and its expression in node I below the panicles is greatly enhanced when the panicle is completely emerged
    + Knockout of Lsi6 decreased Si accumulation in the panicles but increased Si accumulation in the flag leaf
    + Lsi6 is mainly localized at the xylem transfer cells located at the outer boundary region of the enlarged large vascular bundles in node I
    + Herein, we report on a transporter (Lsi6) responsible for the redirection of a plant nutrient at the node
    + These results suggest that Lsi6 is a transporter involved in intervascular transfer (i
    + Cellular localization studies revealed that Lsi6 is found in the xylem parenchyma cells of the leaf sheath and leaf blades
    + These results indicate that Lsi6 is a transporter responsible for the transport of Si out of the xylem and subsequently affects the distribution of Si in the leaf
    + Here, we describe a transporter, Lsi6, which is involved in the distribution of Si in the shoots
