* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We found that sufficient amount of the LDMAR transcript is required for normal pollen development of plants grown under long-day conditions
    + This change brought about increased methylation in the putative promoter region of LDMAR, which reduced the transcription of LDMAR specifically under long-day conditions, resulting in premature programmed cell death (PCD) in developing anthers, thus causing PSMS
