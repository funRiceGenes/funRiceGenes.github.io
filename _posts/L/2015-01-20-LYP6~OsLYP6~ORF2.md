* **Key message**  
    + Here we further demonstrated the important roles of OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice defense signaling, as silencing of either LYP impaired the defense marker gene activation induced by either bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaecola or fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
    + OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction
