* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, ectopic expression of LRK2 seedlings resulted in increased tiller development
    + Overexpression of the leucine-rich receptor-like kinase gene LRK2 increases drought tolerance and tiller number in rice.
    + These results suggest that LRK2 functions as a positive regulator of the drought stress response and tiller development via increased branch development in rice
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing LRK2 exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought stress due to an increased number of lateral roots compared to the wild-type at the vegetative stage
