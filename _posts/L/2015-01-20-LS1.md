* **Key message**  
    + DNA damage caused by HLHT stress induces ROS accumulation, which causes the injury and apoptosis of leaf cells in the ls1 mutant
    + <U+2022> We characterized and cloned LS1 by map-based cloning and genetic complementation
    + TUNEL and comet assays indicated that mutation of LS1 led to severe DNA damage under HLHT stress
    + Furthermore, we found excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the ls1 mutant under HLHT stress
