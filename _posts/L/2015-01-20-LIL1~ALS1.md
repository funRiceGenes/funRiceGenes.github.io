    + Under natural field conditions, the leaves of LIL1 mutant plants exhibited light-induced, small, rust-red lesions that first appeared at the leaf tips and subsequently expanded throughout the entire leaf blade to the leaf sheath
    + The LIL1 mutants also displayed increased expression of defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea)
    + Thus, LIL1 is a novel LMM in rice that will facilitate the further study of the molecular mechanisms of HR and the rice blast resistance
    + Histochemical staining indicated that LIL1 lesions displayed an abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resulted from programmed cell death (PCD)
    + Sequence analysis of these 12 candidate genes revealed a G to A base substitution in the fourth exon of LOC_Os07g30510, a putative cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase (CRK), which led to an amino acid change (Val 429 to Ile) in the LIL1 protein
    + Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs), such as LIL1 that was identified in an ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenized population of Indica rice (Oryza sativa L
    + Overexpression of the LOC_Os07g30510 gene from LIL1 induced a LIL1-like lesion phenotype in Nipponbare
    + A semi-dominant lesion mimic mutant als1 (apoptosis leaf and sheath 1) in rice was identified to demonstrate spontaneous lesions on the leaf blade and sheath
    + ALS1 was expressed mainly in the leaf blade and sheath, in which further study revealed that ALS1 was present in the vascular bundles
    + Functional studies of ALS1 were conducted, including phylogenetic analysis, expression analysis, subcellular location and blast resistance identification
    + The mutation of ALS1 caused a constitutively activated defence response in als1
    + The results of our study imply that ALS1 participate in a defence response resembling the common SA-, JA- and NH1- mediated defence responses in rice
