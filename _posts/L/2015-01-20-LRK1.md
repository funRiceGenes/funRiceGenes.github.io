* **Key message**  
    + Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms
    + The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27
    + The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops
    + Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components
    + Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase
    + Our data suggest that rice LRK1 regulates rice branch number by enhancing cellular proliferation
    + This study demonstrates a substantial natural variation of Rd in rice and that the LRK1 gene can regulate leaf dark respiratory fluxes, especially under high temperature
    + A rice lrk1 mutant shows only ~37% Rd of that of WT and retarded growth following exposure to 35 <a1><e3>C for 30 days, but only 24% reduction in growth was recorded under normal temperature (25 <a1><e3>C)
    + Particularly, we observed that the LRK1 gene, annotated as leucine rich repeat receptor kinase, was up-regulated four times
