* **Key message**  
    + The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem
    + LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
    + LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis
    + Revising the long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity

* **Connection**  
    + __LOG__, __RGN1__, [RGN1 controls grain number and shapes panicle architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RGN1 controls grain number and shapes panicle architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We demonstrated that RGN1 controls lateral grain formation by regulation of LONELY GUY (LOG) expression, thus controlling grain number and shaping panicle architecture
