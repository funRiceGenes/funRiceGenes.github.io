* **Key message**  
    + Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs
    + LEPTO1 is also essential for programmed cell death in tapetal cells
    + Furthermore, lepto1 mutants fail to form chromosomal double-strand breaks, do not recruit meiosis-specific proteins to the meiotic chromosomes, and show disrupted callose deposition
    + DLC1 is strongly expressed in the pollen mother cells (PMCs) and tapetum and encodes a nucleus-located rice type-B response regulator (RR) with transcriptional activity
    + Further investigations show that DLC1 interacts with all five putative rice histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPs) in yeast and planta cells, suggesting a possible participation of the two-component signalling systems (TCS) in rice meiosis
    + Our results demonstrate that DLC1 is required for rice meiosis and fertility, providing useful information for the role of TCS in rice meiosis
    + The dlc1 mutant is sterile in both male and female gametophytes due to an earlier defect in the leptotene chromosome and subsequent abnormalities at later stages
