* **Key message**  
    + Expression of lip19 is positively regulated by low temperature, but not affected by high (40 degrees C) temperature
    + The possibility is suggested that Lip19 is a transcriptional factor that is positively controlled by low temperature
    + The rice low-temperature-induced lip19 gene encodes a 148-amino-acid basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, termed LIP19
    + Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical
    + Based upon the presented data, we propose a model describing the low-temperature signal switching mediated by LIP19 in rice
