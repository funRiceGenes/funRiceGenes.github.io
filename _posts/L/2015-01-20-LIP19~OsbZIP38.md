## Expression information

## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression of lip19 is positively regulated by low temperature, but not affected by high (40 degrees C) temperature
2. __temperature__, [Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif%5BTitle%5D)),  The possibility is suggested that Lip19 is a transcriptional factor that is positively controlled by low temperature"

## Connection
1. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The protein-protein interaction in homo- and hetero-combinations between LIP19 and OsOBF1 was confirmed in vitro and in planta
2. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  LIP19 and OsOBF1 most likely interact with each other more strongly than OsOBF1 interacts with itself, and the resulting heterodimer binds to the C/G hybrid sequence but not to the hexamer sequence
3. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical
