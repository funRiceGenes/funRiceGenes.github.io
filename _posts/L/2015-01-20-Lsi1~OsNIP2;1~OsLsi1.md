* **Key message**  
    + Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake
    + The rice (Oryza sativa) silicon transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1, an aquaporin channel) is the major entry route of arsenite into rice roots
    + Recently, a gene (Low silicon rice1 [Lsi1]) encoding a Si transporter was identified in rice roots
    + Consistent with the Si uptake pattern, Lsi1 expression and distribution of the Lsi1 protein were found only in the basal zone of roots
    + In the basal zones of the seminal, crown, and lateral roots, the Lsi1 protein showed a polar localization at the distal side of both the exodermis and endodermis, where the Casparian bands are formed
    + Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier)
    + The results demonstrate that Lsi1 mediates the uptake of undissociated methylated As in rice roots
    + Herein, we show evidence that the uptake of selenite, a main bioavailable form of Se in paddy soils, is mediated by a silicon (Si) influx transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1) in rice
    + Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots
    + Whether Lsi1 also mediates arsenite efflux was investigated
    + *Expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes enhanced arsenite efflux, indicating that Lsi1 facilitates arsenite transport bidirectionally
    + A rice mutant defective in Lsi1 (lsi1) extruded significantly less arsenite than the wild-type rice and, as a result, accumulated more arsenite in the roots
    + *We conclude that Lsi1 plays a role in arsenite efflux in rice roots exposed to arsenate
    + The role of the rice aquaporin Lsi1 in arsenite efflux from roots
    + A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice
    + Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1
    + Involvement of silicon influx transporter OsNIP2;1 in selenite uptake in rice
    + Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1
    + Spatial distribution and temporal variation of the rice silicon transporter Lsi1
    + Taken together, our results indicate that Si influx transporter OsNIP2;1 is permeable to selenite
    + The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath
    + Here we describe the Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) gene, which controls silicon accumulation in rice, a typical silicon-accumulating plant
    + Suppression of Lsi1 expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake
    + Furthermore, expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only
    + Defect of OsNIP2;1 resulted in a significant decrease in the Se concentration of the shoots and xylem sap when selenite was given
    + There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions
    + A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half roots were exposed to Si
    + In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and that the region between -327 to -292 in the OsLsi1 promoter is involved in this regulation of OsLsi1 expression in rice
    + A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si
    + In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and the region between -327 and -292 in the OsLsi1 promoter is involved in this regulation of OsLsi1 expression in rice
    + Our results suggest that when overexpressed Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice, it possibility regulates the transcription factor OsWRKY53 in addition to the genes involved in the ROS metabolism, thus mediating resistance to chilling stress
    + Overexpression of Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice mediates transcriptional regulatory networks and enhances resistance to chilling stress
    + Our results demonstrate that Lsi1 overexpression or interference causes changes in both miRNA expression and antioxidant capacity in rice, and therefore modulates rice tolerance to UV-B radiation
    + In rice, the accumulation of Si is controlled by the low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) gene; overexpression of Lsi1 (Lsi1-OX) increases Si uptake and accumulation, while the reverse is observed in Lsi1-RNA interference (Lsi1-RNAi) transgenic rice
    + Furthermore, the cellular localization of OsLsi1 was altered; OsLsi1 localized at the root exodermis of the wild-type rice was changed to be localized to other cell layers of the mutant roots
    + The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
    + Root silicon deposition and its resultant reduction of sodium bypass flow is modulated by OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 in rice
    + In summary, our results reveal that Si deposition at root endodermis and its resultant reduction of Na+ bypass flow is modulated by OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and regulated by the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, implying that root Si deposition could be an active and physiologically-regulated process in rice
    + In this study, we investigated the roles of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 in Si-induced reduction of bypass flow and its resultant alleviation of salt stress by using lsi1 and lsi2 mutants (defective in OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, respectively) and their wild types (WTs)
