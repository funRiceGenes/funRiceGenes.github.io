* **Key message**  
    + The cells in the elongation zone of ospho2 seedling roots were much shorter than those of the wild type
    + The ospho2 mutants exhibited defects in growth and reproductive development in the whole growing period
    + Here we report that OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter gene OsPT2 by physical interaction and upstream regulation of OsPHO2 in roots
    + Our data also show that OsSPX1 is a negative regulator of OsPHR2 and is involved in the feedback of Pi-signaling network in roots that is defined by OsPHR2 and OsPHO2
    + In association with enhanced Pi uptake and transport, some Pi transporters were up-regulated in the ltn1 mutant in the presence of sufficient Pi
    + This study thus provides evidence that OsPHO2, which functions at the downstream of OsPHF1, modulates Pi utilization by regulating the expression of Pht1 transporters in rice
    + Furthermore, the elongation of primary and adventitious roots was enhanced in the ltn1 mutant under Pi starvation, suggesting that LTN1 is involved in Pi-dependent root architecture alteration
    + These results suggest that ospho2 mutant phenotype results from a partial defect in Pi translocation and remobilization in the shoot of rice
    + OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 through physical interaction and reciprocal regulation of OsPHO2 in roots
    + The ltn1 mutant exhibited increased Pi uptake and translocation, which led to Pi overaccumulation in shoots
    + Furthermore, OsPT1 expression was strongly enhanced by the mutation of Phosphate Overaccumulator2 (OsPHO2) but not by Phosphate Starvation Response2, indicating that OsPT1 is involved in the OsPHO2-regulated Pi pathway
    + Furthermore, Pi levels in the ospho2 mutants were highest in the oldest leaf and lowest in the youngest leaf, whereas there was no significant difference in the corresponding leaves of wild-type plants
    + OsSPX1 suppresses the regulation on expression of OsPT2 by OsPHR2 and the accumulation of excess shoot Pi, but it does not suppress induction of OsPT2 or the accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in the Ospho2 mutant
    + The phosphorus concentration in the blades of ospho2 mutants was 5
    + Map-based cloning identified LTN1 as LOC_Os05g48390, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis PHO2, which plays important roles in Pi starvation signaling
    + Under Pi-sufficient conditions, typical Pi starvation responses such as stimulation of phosphatase and RNase activities, lipid composition alteration, nitrogen assimilation repression, and increased metal uptake were also activated in ltn1
    + Our results strongly indicate that LTN1 is a crucial Pi starvation signaling component downstream of miR399 involved in the regulation of multiple Pi starvation responses in rice
    + In this work, a rice leaf tip necrosis1 (ltn1) mutant was identified and characterized
    + Fine characterization of OsPHO2 knockout mutants reveals its key role in Pi utilization in rice
    + Previous research using forward genetics approaches demonstrated that OsPHO2 regulates multiple phosphate-starvation responses in rice
    + In this work, we finely characterized two independent OsPHO2 knockout rice mutants under inorganic phosphate (Pi)-sufficient conditions
    + Reduced growth, leaf tip necrosis, delayed flowering and over-accumulation of Pi in leaves compared to wild-type were shared features of Osgi and Ospho2 plants
    + The interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGI links high-level regulators of Pi homeostasis and development in rice
    + A yeast-two-hybrid screen using Oryza sativa (rice) PHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGIGANTEA, a key regulator of flowering time, which was confirmed using bimolecular flourescenec complementation (BiFC)
    + Pi analysis of individual leaves demonstrated that Osgi, similar to Ospho2 mutants, were impaired in Pi remobilization from old to young leaves, albeit to a lesser extent
    + Finally, the dynamic transcriptional regulation of OsRNS genes by overexpression of OsPHR2, ospho2 mutant, and overexpression of OsPT1 lines involved in Pi signaling pathway suggests the molecular basis of OsRNS family in Pi recycling via RNA decay under Pi starvation
    + The sap experiment clearly showed the significant increases in levels of Phe in the xylem sap of ospho2 than the WT grown hydroponically with Phe and +Pi
    + However, the concentrations of Phe in the seeds were comparable in the WT and mutants, suggesting a pivotal of OsPHO2 in attenuating Phe toxicity in the seed
    + Distribution of phenanthrene in the ospho2 reveals the involvement of phosphate on phenanthrene translocation and accumulation in rice.
    + In the present study, the role of OsPHO2 in regulating the translocation and accumulation of phenanthrene (Phe) and the involvement of Pi in this process were investigated
    + In +Phe WT, the relative expression level of OsPHO2 in the shoots was significantly lower, while those of Pi transporters (PTs) OsPT4 and OsPT8 were significantly higher in the roots compared with -Phe
