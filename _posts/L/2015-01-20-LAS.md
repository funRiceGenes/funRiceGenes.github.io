* **Key message**  
    + Together, our findings indicated that LAS is essential not only for chloroplast development by stabilizing the NEP and PEP gene expression, but also for protein synthesis and construction of the ribosome system in rice chloroplasts
    + Physiological and ultrastructural analysis of las mutant plants revealed weak chlorophyll fluorescence, negligible chlorophyll accumulation, and defective thylakoid membrane development
