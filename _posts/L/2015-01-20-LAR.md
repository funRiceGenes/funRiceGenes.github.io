## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves%5BTitle%5D)),  The genes encoding LAR were expressed in developing fruit, particularly in seeds, but had low expression in leaves
2. __seed__, [Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves%5BTitle%5D)),  The two LAR genes had different patterns of expression in skin and seeds
3. __seed__, [Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves%5BTitle%5D)),  During grape ripening, PA levels decreased in both skin and seeds, and expression of genes encoding ANR and LAR were no longer detected
4. __leaf__, [Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves%5BTitle%5D)),  We measured PA content and expression of genes encoding ANR, LAR, and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase in grape berries during development and in grapevine leaves, which accumulated PA throughout leaf expansion
