* **Key message**  
    + Overexpressing lncRNA LAIR increases grain yield and regulates neighbouring gene cluster expression in rice.
    + LAIR overexpression increases rice grain yield and upregulates the expression of several LRK genes
    + Overall, this study reveals the role of lncRNA LAIR in regulating rice grain yield and lncRNAs may be useful targets for crop breeding
    + Here, we identify a lncRNA transcribed from the antisense strand of neighbouring gene LRK (leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase) cluster named LAIR (LRK Antisense Intergenic RNA)
