* **Information**  
    + Symbol: LTT1  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Plant Cell Environ.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions
    + Cold-induced ROS accumulation is therefore prevented in the anthers of the ltt1 mutants allowing correct development
    + A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.
