* **Key message**  
    + Hence, the ltt1 mutation can significantly improve the seed setting ability of cold-sensitive rice varieties under low-temperature stress conditions, with little yield penalty under optimal temperature conditions
    + Cold-induced ROS accumulation is therefore prevented in the anthers of the ltt1 mutants allowing correct development
    + A point mutation in LTT1 enhances cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice.
