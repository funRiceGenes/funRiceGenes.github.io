## Key message
1. __ATPase__, [The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.%5BTitle%5D), The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.
2. __defense response__, [The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.%5BTitle%5D), The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.
3. __cell death__, [The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.%5BTitle%5D), The pathogenesis-related PR genes PBZ1 and PR1 were induced in lmr, which also showed enhanced resistance to rice blast Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), suggesting LMR is a negative regulator of cell death in rice.
4. __PCD__, [The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.%5BTitle%5D), The pathogenesis-related PR genes PBZ1 and PR1 were induced in lmr, which also showed enhanced resistance to rice blast Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), suggesting LMR is a negative regulator of cell death in rice.
5. __lesion mimic__, [The rice Oryza sativa L. LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice Oryza sativa L.
