## Key message
1. __disease__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  The Ltp1 transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions
2. __stomata__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis of pdelta1176Gus leaf samples inoculated with the blast fungus demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is induced in all cell types of tissues surrounding the lesion and notably in stomata guard cells
3. __vegetative__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development
4. __reproductive__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development
5. __blast disease__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  The Ltp1 transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions
6. __blast__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  The Ltp1 transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions

8. __leaf__, [Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene%5BTitle%5D),  Analysis of pdelta1176Gus leaf samples inoculated with the blast fungus demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is induced in all cell types of tissues surrounding the lesion and notably in stomata guard cells
