## Expression information

## Key message
1. __auxin__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that LA1, a novel grass-specific gene, is temporally and spatially expressed, and plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT)
2. __tiller__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
3. __tiller__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
4. __iaa__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
5. __shoot__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
6. __shoot__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
7. __tiller angle__, [LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
