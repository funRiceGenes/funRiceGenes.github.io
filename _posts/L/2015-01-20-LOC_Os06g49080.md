* **Key message**  
    + Suppression of endogenous OsLIC expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice
    + Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway
    + OsLIC, a Novel CCCH-Type Zinc Finger Protein with Transcription Activation, Mediates Rice Architecture via Brassinosteroids Signaling
    + Quantitative PCR revealed LIC transcription rapidly induced by BR treatment
    + Image analysis and immunoblotting showed that upon BR treatment LIC proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion
    + Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels
    + Here we describe a novel CCCH-type zinc finger gene, OsLIC (Oraza sativaleaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture
    + OsLIC may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture
    + OsLIC is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud
    + The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending
    + LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
    + Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1
    + Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice
    + The phenotypes of lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines in erect leaves contribute to ideal plant architecture
    + OsRELA Regulates Leaf Inclination by Repressing the Transcriptional Activity of OsLIC in Rice
    + Therefore, our results suggest that OsRELA can act as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the regulation of leaf inclination by regulating the transcriptional activity of OsLIC
    + OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein OsLIC to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.
    + Rice OsLIC encoding a CCCH zinc finger transcription factor plays an important role in immunity
    + Genetic assays confirmed that the osilc knockout mutants and OsWRKY30-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc, knocking out OsWRKY30 in the oslic mutants attenuated the resistance against bacterial pathogens
    + OsMAPK6 physically interacted with and phosphorylated OsLIC leading to decreased OsLIC DNA-binding activity, therefore, overexpression of OsLIC partially suppressed OsMAPK6-mediated rice resistance
    + Collectively, these results reveal that OsMAPK6-mediated phosphorylation of OsLIC positively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and Xoc by modulating OsWRKY30 transcription, suggesting that OsMAPK6-OsLIC-OsWRKY30 module is an immune signaling pathway in response to the bacterial pathogens
