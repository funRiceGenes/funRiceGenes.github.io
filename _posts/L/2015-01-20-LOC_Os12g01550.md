* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of AGO10 in an LBD12-1 overexpression background rescued the growth defect phenotype of LBD12-1 overexpressing plants
    + lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to WT under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress
    + The LBD12-1 transcription factor suppresses apical meristem size by repressing Argonaute 10 expression.
    + The expression of LBD12-1 and its binding ability to the AGO10 promoter is induced by stress
