* **Key message**  
    + Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues
    + The LP2 promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in etiolated rice seedlings
    + We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf Panicle 2 gene (LP2, Os02g40240)
    + Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice
