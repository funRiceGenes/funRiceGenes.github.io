* **Key message**  
    + Here we report that LARGE2 encodes a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase OsUPL2 and regulates panicle size and grain number in rice
    + LARGE2 regulates panicle size and grain number by repressing meristematic activity
    + Biochemical analyses show that LARGE2 physically associates with ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) and APO2, two positive regulators of panicle size and grain number, and modulates their stabilities
    + Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with APO1 and APO2 in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number
    + The loss of function large2 mutants produce large panicles with increased grain number, wide grains and leaves, and thick culms
