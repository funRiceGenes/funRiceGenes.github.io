* **Key message**  
    + The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
    + Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity
    + In this study, T-DNA mutant and RNAi transgenic approaches were used to functionally characterize a unique rice gene, LAGGING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 1 (LGD1)
    + Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters
    + The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi-dwarfism
