    + Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice.
    + Disruption of this gene in Oshsp40 mutants significantly reduced the leaf size compared with that of WT in rice
    + Microscopic examination showed that OsHSP40 modulated leaf size via regulating the veins formation and cell size/cell number
    + Therefore, the natural variation of OsHSP40 contributing to leaf size might be useful for rice breeding
    + Nucleotide diversity analysis indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation of C to T in the coding region of OsHSP40 may cause small leaves among rice accessions
    + Leaf Mutant 7 Encoding Heat Shock Protein OsHSP40 Regulates Leaf Size in Rice
    + NAL11 loss-of-function mutants present impaired chloroplast development and gibberellin (GA) defects
    + The DnaJ domain-containing heat-shock protein NAL11 determines plant architecture by mediating gibberellin homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa).
    + A promising rare allele of NAL11 (NAL11(-923del-1552) ) positively selected in Aus cultivars was identified; this allele exhibited increased expression and generated relatively few tillers, thick stems, and large panicles, components of the ideal plant architecture (IPA)
    + Genetic analyses support the hypothesis that NAL11 acts downstream of IPA1 to regulate IPA by modulating GA homeostasis, and NAL11 may be an essential complement for IPA1
    + NAL11 is involved in regulating the cell cycle and cell proliferation
