* **Key message**  
    + The rice (Oryza sativa L.) LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.
    + The pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PBZ1 and PR1 were induced in lmr, which also showed enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), suggesting LMR is a negative regulator of cell death in rice.
    + The Multivesicular Bodies (MVBs)-Localized AAA ATPase LRD6-6 Inhibits Immunity and Cell Death Likely through Regulating MVBs-Mediated Vesicular Trafficking in Rice.
    + Here we report the identification and characterization of a MVBs-localized AAA ATPase LRD6-6 in rice
    + The ATPase activity and homo-dimerization of LRD6-6 is essential for its regulation on plant immunity and cell death
    + Collectively, our study shows that the AAA ATPase LRD6-6 inhibits plant immunity and cell death most likely through modulating MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking in rice
    + Disruption of LRD6-6 leads to enhanced immunity and cell death in rice
    + The LRD6-6 protein co-localizes with the MVBs marker protein RabF1/ARA6 and interacts with ESCRT-III components OsSNF7 and OsVPS2
    + Further analysis reveals that LRD6-6 is required for MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking and inhibits the biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds
