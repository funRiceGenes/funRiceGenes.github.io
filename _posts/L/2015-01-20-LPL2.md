* **Key message**  
    + The lpl2-1 also exhibited irregular stomata patterns, reduced plant height, and short panicles and roots.
    + Collectively, the results indicate that LPL2 and LPL3 are two functionally conserved homologs of the SCAR/WAVE complex components, and that they play an important role in controlling epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice by organising F-actin.
    + lpl2-1 exhibits severe defects in epidermal PC lobe development
