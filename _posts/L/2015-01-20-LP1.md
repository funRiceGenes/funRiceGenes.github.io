* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Sequencing analysis of LP1 in two parents and 103 rice accessions indicated that SNP1 is associated with panicle length
    + The LP1 allele of Xiushui79 leads to reduced panicle length, whereas the allele of C-bao relieves the suppression of panicle length
    + LP1 and the elite alleles can be used to improve panicle length in rice
