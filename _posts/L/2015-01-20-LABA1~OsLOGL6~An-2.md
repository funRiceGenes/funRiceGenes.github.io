* **Key message**  
    + Haplotype analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication
    + Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development
    + A frame-shift deletion in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation
    + The near-isogenic line harboring a wild allele An-2 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai 4 shows that An-2 promote awn elongation by enhancing cell division, but decreases grain production by reducing grains per panicle and tillers per plant
    + An-2 Encodes a Cytokinin Synthesis Enzyme That Regulates Awn Length and Grain Production in Rice.
    + We reveal that a genetic variation in the An-2 locus has a large impact on reducing awn length and increasing tiller and grain numbers in domesticated rice
    + We therefore proposed that the selection of the genetic variation in An-2 was due to reduced awn length and increased grain yield in cultivated rice
    + Expressional analysis demonstrates that An-1 regulates the formation of awn primordial, and An-2 promotes awn elongation
    + Here we report the cloning of An-2 gene, encoding a Lonely Guy Like protein 6 (OsLOGL6), which catalyzes the final step of cytokinin synthesis in O
    + Analyses of minimum spanning trees and introgression regions demonstrated that An-1, an important gene for awn formation, was preferentially domesticated, and its mutation to an-1 was followed by GLA and An-2
