* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Ltp2 mRNA is accumulated only in mature seeds
    + The positively charged residues on the molecular surface of nsLTP2 are structurally similar to other plant defense proteins

* **Connection**  
    + __LTP2~nsLTP2__, __OsC6__, [OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D), Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots
