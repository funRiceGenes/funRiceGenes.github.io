* **Key message**  
    + Together, our findings indicated that LAS is essential not only for chloroplast development by stabilizing the NEP and PEP gene expression, but also for protein synthesis and construction of the ribosome system in rice chloroplasts
    + Physiological and ultrastructural analysis of las mutant plants revealed weak chlorophyll fluorescence, negligible chlorophyll accumulation, and defective thylakoid membrane development
    + Rice TSV2 encoding threonyl-tRNA synthetase is needed for early chloroplast development and seedling growth under cold stress.

    + __LAS~TSV2__, __OsMAP__, [Lethal albinic seedling, encoding a threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in development of plastid protein synthesis system in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Lethal albinic seedling, encoding a threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in development of plastid protein synthesis system in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  By map based cloning we determined that the LAS allele gene encodes threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS)
