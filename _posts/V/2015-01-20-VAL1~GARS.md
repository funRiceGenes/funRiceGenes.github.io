* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrate that VAL1 is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and is involved in regulating chloroplast development, chlorophyll metabolism, and cell division during leaf development in rice
    + Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that VAL1 was localized in the chloroplast
    + Map-based cloning revealed that VAL1 encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase (PurD), the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway
    + Our results indicated that GARS was involved in chloroplast development at early leaf development by affecting the expression of plastid-encoded genes
    + Purine nucleotide biosynthetic gene GARS controls early chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + GARS protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern in rice protoplasts
    + In this research, we characterized a novel gars mutant with white striped leaves at the seedling stage
    + GARS encodes an enzyme catalyzing the second step of purine nucleotide biosynthesis and plays an important role to maintain the development of chloroplasts in juvenile plants by affecting the expression of plastid-encoded genes
