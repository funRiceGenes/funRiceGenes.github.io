* **Key message**  
    + The v2 mutant is temperature-sensitive and develops chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures
    + The v2 mutation causes inhibition of chloroplast differentiation; in particular, it disrupts the chloroplast translation machinery during early leaf development [Sugimoto et al
    + Here we show that a novel gene, VIRESCENT 2 (V2), encodes a new type of GK (designated pt/mtGK) that is localized in plastids and mitochondria

* **Connection**  
    + __OsWRKY13~WRKY13__, __v2__, [Gene network mediated by WRKY13 to regulate resistance against sheath infecting fungi in rice Oryza sativa L..](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gene network mediated by WRKY13 to regulate resistance against sheath infecting fungi in rice Oryza sativa L..%5BTitle%5D),  To compute and evaluate the possible molecular mechanism for observed resistance correlated to WRKY13 gene expression, rice gene expression profiles against bacterial leaf blight and leaf blast disease from ROAD database were used to prioritize the locus IDs that were used as input in RiceNet v2 tool
    + __CDE4__, __v2__, [CDE4 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in chloroplast RNA splicing and affects chloroplast development under low-temperature conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=CDE4 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in chloroplast RNA splicing and affects chloroplast development under low-temperature conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, CDE4 interacts with the guanylate kinase VIRESCENT 2 (V2); overexpression of V2 enhanced CDE4 protein stability, thereby rescuing the cde4 phenotype at 20°„C
