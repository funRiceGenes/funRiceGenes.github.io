* **Key message**  
    + The v2 mutant is temperature-sensitive and develops chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures
    + The v2 mutation causes inhibition of chloroplast differentiation; in particular, it disrupts the chloroplast translation machinery during early leaf development [Sugimoto et al
    + Here we show that a novel gene, VIRESCENT 2 (V2), encodes a new type of GK (designated pt/mtGK) that is localized in plastids and mitochondria
