* **Key message**  
    + In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period
    + VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development
    + Positional cloning revealed that the VYL gene encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis ClpP6 subunit and that it is targeted to the chloroplast
