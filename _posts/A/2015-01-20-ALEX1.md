* **Key message**  
    + A T-DNA insertion line constructed using enhancer trap system showed a higher expression of ALEX1 and exerted a significant resistance to rice bacterial blight
    + Overexpressing ALEX1 in rice further confirmed the activation of JA pathway and resistance to bacterial blight
