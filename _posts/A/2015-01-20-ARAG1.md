* **Key message**  
    + ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice
    + KEY RESULTS: ARAG1 was expressed in inflorescences, roots, immature embryos and germinating seeds, but not in coleoptiles, leaves or mature embryos
    + ARAG1 knockdown line was hypersensitive to ABA application during seed germination and seedling growth
    + CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ARAG1 was involved in the ABA signalling and stress responsive pathways
    + Knockdown of ARAG1 weakened tolerance of the transgenic seedlings to drought stress, while over-expression of it increased the tolerance slightly
