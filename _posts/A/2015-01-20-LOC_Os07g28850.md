* **Key message**  
    + Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice
    + AGO18 is specifically induced by viral infection and required for antiviral immunity
    + In this manuscript, we show that Oryza sativa indica Argonaute protein AGO18 is required for male gametophyte development likely to through a small RNA-mediated mechanism
    + Although expression of rice AGO18 in specific stages of male gametogenesis has been documented, its major functions in plant development remain poorly understood
    + Here, we show that Oryza sativa indica AGO18 is involved in male gametophyte development
    + Our results indicate a distinct role for rice AGO18 in male fertility
    + Mechanistically, the JA-responsive transcription factor JAMYB directly binds to the AGO18 promoter to activate AGO18 transcription
