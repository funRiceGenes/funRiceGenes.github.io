* **Key message**  
    + RAmy1A and RAmy3E were expressed in all tissues while RAmy3D was expressed in all tissues except the immature seeds
    + RAmy1A transcript was most abundant in the germinating seeds, while RAmy3D and RAmy3E transcripts were most abundant in callus and immature seeds, respectively
    + Using the RAmy3D promoter system in transgenic rice cell suspensions results in two phases of the culture, the growth phase and the induction phase
