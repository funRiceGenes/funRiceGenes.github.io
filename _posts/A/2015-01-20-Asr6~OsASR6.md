* **Key message**  
    + OsASR6 is activated by auxin and, in turn, increases auxin responses and root auxin sensitivity, as observed by the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes, such as SAUR32 and PINOID, and the key auxin transcription factor, ARF5
    + PGPR-induced OsASR6 improves plant growth and yield by altering root auxin sensitivity and the xylem structure in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana.
    + Interestingly, OsASR6 expression led to alterations in the xylem structure, an increase in the xylem vessel size and altered lignification, which correlated with higher conductance
    + Ectopic expression of one of these genes, OsASR6 (ABA STRESS RIPENING6), had a remarkable effect on plant growth in Arabidopsis
    + Transgenic OsASR6 over-expressing plants showed higher conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis rates, leading to an Ëœ30% higher seed yield compared with the control
    + Transgenic lines over-expressing OsASR6 had larger leaves, taller inflorescence bolts and greater numbers of siliques and seeds
    + OsASR6 Alleviates Rice Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae via Transcriptional Suppression of OsCIPK15.
    + In this study, we revealed the role of OsASR6 in rice plants&#x27; resistance to two important bacterial diseases caused by Xanthomonas&amp;amp;nbsp;oryzae pv
    + Silencing of OsASR6 in OsASR6-RNAi transgenic plants markedly enhanced rice resistance to the two bacterial pathogens
    + Collectively, these results reveal that OsASR6 alleviates rice resistance through the transcriptional suppression of OsCIPK15, and thus links calcium signaling to rice resistance against X
    + Moreover, comparative transcriptome analyses for OsASR6-RNAi and wild-type plants inoculated and uninoculated with Xoc demonstrated that OsASR6 and WRKY45-1-mediated immunity, SA signaling and redox homeostasis
    + The expression of OsASR6 was strongly elevated in response to both Xoo and Xoc challenges
