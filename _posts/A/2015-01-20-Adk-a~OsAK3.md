* **Key message**  
    + In order to examine the enzyme activity of the protein encoded by the rice cDNA, Adk-a was cloned into an expression vector, pUC119, which was introduced into Escherichia coli strain CV2, a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenylate kinase
    + We found that the transformant carrying the rice Adk-a gene in the sense orientation recovered cell growth at non-permissive high temperature (42 degrees C) and expressed enzyme activities higher than the untransformed CV2 and the transformant possessing Adk-a cDNA in the antisense orientation
    + Two types of genes (Adk-a, and Adk-b) encoding for adenylate kinase (AK, EC 2.7.4.3.) were isolated from the cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a novel BR signaling component OsAK3 in the regulation of grain length, and provides novel clues for uncovering the potential functions of OsAK3 in rice growth and development
    + In addition, RNA-Seq data indicate that OsAK3 is involved in a variety of biological processes that regulate BR signaling and grain development in rice
    + An Adenylate Kinase OsAK3 Involves Brassinosteroid Signaling and Grain Length in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + OsAK3 encodes an adenylate kinase, which regulates grain size by controlling cell expansion of rice spikelet glume
    + Among these mutants, mutant osak3 presents shorter grain length and dwarfing phenotype
    + Overexpression of OsAK3 resulted in longer grain length
    + Lamina inclination, coleoptile elongation and root inhibition experiments showed that the osak3 mutant was less sensitive to exogenous brassinolide (BL) treatment
