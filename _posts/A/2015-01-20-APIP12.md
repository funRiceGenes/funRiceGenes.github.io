* **Key message**  
    + The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.
    + It is worth noting that neither knockout/knockdown nor overexpression of APIP12 attenuates Piz-t resistance
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that APIP12 is a virulence target of AvrPiz-t and is involved in the basal resistance against M
