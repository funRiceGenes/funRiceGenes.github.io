* **Key message**  
    + Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in abc1-1, suggesting that ABC1 plays a critical role in regulating nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance
    + ), the contribution of OsFd-GOGAT to rice foliar nitrogen metabolism remains little up-to-date
    + The results in this study suggested that OsFd-GOGAT might participate in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence, which provides a potential way to improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice
    + The spl32 plants displayed early leaf senescence, identified by disintegration of chloroplasts as cellular evidence, dramatically decreased contents of chlorophyll, up-regulation of superoxide dismutase enzyme activity and malondialdehyde, as physiological characteristic, and both up-regulation of senescence-induced STAY GREEN gene and senescence-associated transcription factors, and down-regulation of photosynthesis-associated genes, as molecular indicators
    + qRT-PCR analysis indicated that several genes related to nitrogen metabolism were differentially expressed in es7
    + In addition, when seedlings are grown under increasing nitrogen concentrations (NH4NO3) for 15 days, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in es7
    + Our results demonstrated that ES7 is involved in nitrogen metabolism, effects chlorophyll synthesis, and may also associated with photorespiration, impacting leaf senescence in rice
    + ES7 was expressed constitutively, and the ES7 protein was localized in chloroplast
    + When es7 plants are grown under photorespiration-suppressed conditions (high CO2), the senescence phenotype and chlorophyll content are rescued
    + The leaves of the es7 mutant begin to senesce at the tillering stage about 60 day after sowing, and become increasingly senescent as the plants develop at the heading stage
