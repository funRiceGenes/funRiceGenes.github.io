* **Key message**  
    + Knock-out of APIP4 in rice enhanced susceptibility and overexpression of APIP4 increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae
    + By contrast, the rice NLR protein Piz-t interacted with APIP4 enhancing APIP4 transcript and protein levels, and protease inhibitor activity
    + Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) BBI protein APIP4 is  a common target of a fungal effector and an NLR receptor for innate immunity
