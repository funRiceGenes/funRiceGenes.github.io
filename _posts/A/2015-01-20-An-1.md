## Key message
1. __grains per panicle__, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-An-1) carrying a wild allele An-1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4
2. __grain yield__, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice
3. __grain number__, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle
