* **Key message**  
    + The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-An-1) carrying a wild allele An-1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4
    + Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice
    + Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle
    + An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice
    + We report here the molecular cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, An-1, which regulates long awn formation in O
    + Genetic variations in the An-1 locus were found to be associated with awn loss in cultivated rice
    + An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein, which regulates cell division
