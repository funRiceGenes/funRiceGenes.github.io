* **Key message**  
    + Here, we show that ARE2 (for ABC1 REPRESSOR2) is a key regulator of nitrogen starvation responses in rice
    + The are2 mutations partially rescue the nitrogen-deficient phenotype of abc1 and the are2 mutants show enhanced tolerance to nitrogen deficiency, suggesting that ARE2 genetically interacts with ABC1/Fd-GOGAT
    + ARE2 encodes a chloroplast-localized RelA/SpoT homolog protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of guanosine pentaphosphate or tetraphosphate (p)ppGpp, an alarmone regulating the stringent response in bacteria under nutritional stress conditions
