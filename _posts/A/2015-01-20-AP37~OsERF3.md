* **Key message**  
    + The overexpression of AP37 and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage
    + More importantly, the OsCc1:AP37 plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance in the field, which increased grain yield by 16% to 57% over controls under severe drought conditions, yet exhibited no significant difference under normal growth conditions
    + Our results suggest that the AP37 gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance in rice without causing undesirable growth phenotypes
    + Overexpression of the Transcription Factor AP37 in Rice Improves Grain Yield under Drought Conditions
    + We discovered a nucleus-localized ERF gene in rice (Oryza sativa), OsERF3, that was rapidly up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis
    + These results suggest that OsERF3, an AP2 (APETALA 2 Gene)/ERF transcription factor, binds the LRK6 promoter at this new motif, which might cause differential expression of LRK6 in the 93-11/Nipponbare hybrid
    + Here, we first revealed that the expression of OsERF3 was induced by drought, salt, ACC and ABA treatment
    + Increased tolerance to low temperatures was observed only in OsCc1:AP37 plants
    + OsERF3 is a transcriptional repressor with an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif (F/LDLNxxP), which transcriptionally represses the ethylene emission and drought tolerance in rice
    + Thus, our data reveal that the EAR motif is required for OsERF3 to transcriptionally regulate the ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice, providing new insight to the roles of ethylene-response factor proteins in regulating ethylene biosynthesis and stress response
    + EAR motif mutation of rice OsERF3 alters the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance
    + We propose that OsERF3 affects early components of herbivore-induced defense responses by suppressing MAPK repressors and modulating JA, SA, ethylene and H(2)O(2) pathways as well as plant resistance
    + On the other hand, OsERF3 was slightly suppressed by the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (St√•l) and increased susceptibility to this piercing sucking insect, possibly by suppressing H(2)O(2) biosynthesis
    + Our results also illustrate that OsERF3 acts as a central switch that gears the plant's metabolism towards an appropriate response to chewing or piercing/sucking insects
    + Antisense and over-expression of OsERF3 revealed that it positively affects transcript levels of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and two WRKY genes as well as concentrations of jasmonate (JA), salicylate (SA) and the activity of trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs)
    + Moreover, overexpression of OsERF3/OsAP2-39 suppressed ethylene synthesis
    + In addition, application of ACC recovered the drought-sensitive phenotype in the lines overexpressing OsERF3, showing that ethylene production contributed to drought response in rice
    + Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice
    + Functional analysis revealed that ERF3 was essential for crown root development and acts in auxin- and cytokinin-responsive gene expression.
    + Also, increased expression of ERF3 could partially complement wox11, indicating that the two genes functioned cooperatively to regulate crown root development.
    + Furthermore, ERF3-regulated RR2 expression was involved in crown root initiation, while the ERF3/WOX11 interaction likely repressed RR2 during crown root elongation.
