* **Key message**  
    + In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
    + Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
    + AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild-type plants, but not in mutant plants
    + cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
