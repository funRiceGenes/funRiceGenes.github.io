## Expression information

## Key message
1. __flower__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
2. __pollen__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
3. __panicle__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild-type plants, but not in mutant plants
4. __spikelet__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
5. __spikelet__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
6. __grain__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
7. __tiller__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
8. __anther__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
9. __anther__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
10. __sterility__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
