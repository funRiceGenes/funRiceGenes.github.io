* **Key message**  
    + It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8
    + MicroRNA167 (miR167) was shown to cleave auxin responsive factor 8 (ARF8) mRNA in cultured rice cells
    + When cells grew in auxin-free medium, miR167 level decreased, resulting in an increase in the level of ARF8 mRNA
    + This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence
    + This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses
