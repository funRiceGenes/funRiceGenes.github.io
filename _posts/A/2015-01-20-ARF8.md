## Key message
1. __iaa__, ['Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term='Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'%5BTitle%5D),  It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8
2. __auxin__, ['Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term='Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'%5BTitle%5D), MicroRNA167 miR167 was shown to cleave auxin responsive factor 8 ARF8 mRNA in cultured rice cells
3. __auxin__, ['Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term='Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'%5BTitle%5D),  When cells grew in auxin-free medium, miR167 level decreased, resulting in an increase in the level of ARF8 mRNA
4. __auxin__, ['Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term='Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'%5BTitle%5D),  This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence
5. __auxin__, ['Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term='Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'%5BTitle%5D),  This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses
