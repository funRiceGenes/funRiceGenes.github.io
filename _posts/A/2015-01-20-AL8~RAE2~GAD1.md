* **Key message**  
    + Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice
    + The RAE2 precursor is specifically cleaved by SLP1 in the rice spikelet, where the mature RAE2 peptide subsequently induces awn elongation
    + GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.
    + A frame-shift insertion in gad1 destroyed the conserved cysteine residues of the peptide, resulting in a loss of function, and causing the increased number of grains per panicle, shorter grains and awnless phenotype characteristic of cultivated rice
