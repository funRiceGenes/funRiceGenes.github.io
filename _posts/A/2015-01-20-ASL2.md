4. __plumule__, [Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death%5BTitle%5D), ASL2 was expressed at a higher level in the plumule and leaves, implying its tissue-specific expression.
5. __leaf__, [Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death%5BTitle%5D), ASL2 was expressed at a higher level in the plumule and leaves, implying its tissue-specific expression.
6. __Chl biosynthesis__, [Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death%5BTitle%5D), The transcript levels of the majority of genes for Chl biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl2 mutants
7. __photosynthesis__, [Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death%5BTitle%5D), The transcript levels of the majority of genes for Chl biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl2 mutants
