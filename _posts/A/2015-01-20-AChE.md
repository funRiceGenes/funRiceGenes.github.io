    + [AK073754](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK073754)

* **Key message**  
    + This result clearly suggests that the function of the rice AChE relate to positive regulation of gravitropic response in rice seedlings
    + Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism
    + Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response.
