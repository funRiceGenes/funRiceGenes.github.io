* **Expression information**
__Expression__: Next, the functionality of rice AChE was proved by overexpression in rice plants |  Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response  
__OverExpression__: Next, the functionality of rice AChE was proved by overexpression in rice plants |  Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response

* **Key message**
1. __seedlings__, [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.%5BTitle%5D),  This result clearly suggests that the function of the rice AChE relate to positive regulation of gravitropic response in rice seedlings

4. __gravitropic response__, [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism%5BTitle%5D), Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response.
