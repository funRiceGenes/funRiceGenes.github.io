## Key message
1. __leaf__, [ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei%5BTitle%5D),  Gene products of ACR7 were most abundant in young developing leaf blades of rice, and ACR7 protein is specifically localized in the nucleus of the parenchyma cells of phloem and xylem in the vascular bundles
2. __xylem__, [ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei%5BTitle%5D),  Gene products of ACR7 were most abundant in young developing leaf blades of rice, and ACR7 protein is specifically localized in the nucleus of the parenchyma cells of phloem and xylem in the vascular bundles
3. __vascular bundle__, [ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei%5BTitle%5D),  Gene products of ACR7 were most abundant in young developing leaf blades of rice, and ACR7 protein is specifically localized in the nucleus of the parenchyma cells of phloem and xylem in the vascular bundles
