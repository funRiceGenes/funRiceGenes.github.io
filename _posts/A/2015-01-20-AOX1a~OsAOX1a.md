* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L
    + Both factors were reduced by OsAOX1a overexpression, which revealed that OsAOX1a could reduce oxidative damage under cold stress
    + Taken together, our results suggested that overexpressing OsAOX1a could improve growth performance of rice under cold stress, which might be closely related to the reduction of reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage
    + Steady-state mRNA levels of both of the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b were increased under low temperature (4 degrees C)
    + We found that OsAOX1a overexpression could strongly enhance the cold growth of seedlings, especially with respect to root extension
    + The results suggest that only the mitochondrial SOD, OsMSD, attenuated the stress induction of OsAOX1a/b specifically
    + Therefore, our findings demonstrate that abiotic stress initiates the MRR on OsAOX1a/b and that mitochondrial O2
    + This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines
    + In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies
