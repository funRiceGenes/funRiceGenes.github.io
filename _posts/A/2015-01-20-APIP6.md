* **Key message**  
    + Silencing of APIP6 in transgenic rice leads to a significant reduction of flg22-induced ROS generation, suppression of defense-related gene expression, and enhanced susceptibility of rice plants to M
    + The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice

    + __APIP6__, __OsEF3~OsELF3-2~OsELF3.2__, [OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsELF3-2 interacts with APIP6 and negatively regulates basal resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.
    + __APIP12__, __APIP6__, [The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D), APIP12 significantly bound to AvrPiz-t and APIP6 in its middle portion and N-terminus, respectively, in yeast two-hybrid assay
    + __APIP12__, __APIP6__, [The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.%5BTitle%5D), Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay further verified the interactions of APIP12 with AvrPiz-t and APIP6
    + __APIP6__, __OsUBC26__, [Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, OsUBC26 working with APIP6 ubiquitinateds AvrPiz-t, an avirulence effector of M
    + __APIP6__, __OsUBC26__, [Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae%5BTitle%5D),  In summary, OsUBC26 plays important roles in rice disease resistance by regulating WRKY45 expression and working with E3 ligases such as APIP6 to counteract the effector protein AvrPiz-t from M
    + __APIP6__, __UCIP2__, [Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme OsUBC26 is essential for immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast two-hybrid screening using UCIP2 as bait revealed that APIP6 is a binding partner of UCIP2
