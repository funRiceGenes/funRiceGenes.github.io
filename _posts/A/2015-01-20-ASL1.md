## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D),  Map-based cloning revealed that ASL1 encodes PRP S20 PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast
2. __chloroplast__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D),  The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
3. __photosynthesis__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D),  The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
4. __seedling__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D),  This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, asl1 albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage
5. __seedling__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D),  ASL1 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues
