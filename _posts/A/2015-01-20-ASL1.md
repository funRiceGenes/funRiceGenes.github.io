* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning revealed that ASL1 encodes PRP S20 (PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast
    + The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
    + This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, asl1 (albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage
    + ASL1 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues
