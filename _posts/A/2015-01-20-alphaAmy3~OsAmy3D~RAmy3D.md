## Key message
1. __seed__, [Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes%5BTitle%5D)),  RAmy1A and RAmy3E were expressed in all tissues while RAmy3D was expressed in all tissues except the immature seeds
2. __seed__, [Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes%5BTitle%5D)),  RAmy1A transcript was most abundant in the germinating seeds, while RAmy3D and RAmy3E transcripts were most abundant in callus and immature seeds, respectively
