* **Key message**  
    + A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice
    + ART1 is constitutively expressed in the root, and the expression level is not affected by Al treatment
    + ART1 is localized in the nucleus of all root cells
    + Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
    + Identification of a cis-acting element of ART1, a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor for aluminum tolerance in rice
    + Recent identification of a transcription factor AL RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1) revealed that this high Al tolerance in rice is achieved by multiple genes involved in detoxification of Al at different cellular levels
    + We used the promoter region of SENSITIVE TO AL RHIZOTOXICITY1, an Al tolerance gene in the downstream of ART1
    + ART1 is a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor and regulates the expression of 31 genes in the downstream
    + Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
    + Here, we report a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor ART1 (for Al resistance transcription factor 1), which specifically regulates the expression of genes related to Al tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance
    + Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants
    + ART1 and putrescine contribute to rice aluminum resistance via OsMYB30 in cell wall modification.
    + Furthermore, transient dual-luciferase assay showed that ART1 directly inhibited the expression of OsMYB30, and in turn repressed Os4CL5-dependent 4-coumaric acid accumulation, hence reducing the Al-binding capacity of cell wall and enhancing Al resistance
    + We concluded that ART1 confers Put-promoted Al resistance via repression of OsMYB30-regulated modification of cell wall properties in rice
