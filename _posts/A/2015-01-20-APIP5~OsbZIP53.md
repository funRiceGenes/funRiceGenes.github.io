* **Key message**  
    + <U+00A0>oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage
    + Silencing of APIP5 in transgenic rice leads to cell death, and the<U+00A0>phenotype is enhanced by the expression of AvrPiz-t

* **Connection**  
    + __APIP5~OsbZIP53__, __Pi9~Piz-t~Pi2__, [Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.%5BTitle%5D), Conversely, Piz-t interacts with and stabilizes APIP5 to prevent necrosis at the necrotrophic stage
