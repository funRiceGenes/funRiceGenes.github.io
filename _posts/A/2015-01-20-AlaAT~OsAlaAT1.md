* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
    + A cDNA clone encoding alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has isolated from randomly sequenced clones derived from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds by comparison to previously identified genes
    + OsAlaAT1 is predominantly expressed in developing seeds during active starch synthesis
    + Thus, our observations suggest that OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in starch synthesis in developing seeds that are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen
