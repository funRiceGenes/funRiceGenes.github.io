## Key message
1. __nitrogen__, [Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
2. __seed__, [Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D), A cDNA clone encoding alanine aminotransferase AlaAT has isolated from randomly sequenced clones derived from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds by comparison to previously identified genes
3. __seed__, [Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
4. __starch__, [Alanine aminotransferase 1 OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Alanine aminotransferase 1 OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D),  OsAlaAT1 is predominantly expressed in developing seeds during active starch synthesis
5. __starch__, [Alanine aminotransferase 1 OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Alanine aminotransferase 1 OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, our observations suggest that OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in starch synthesis in developing seeds that are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen
