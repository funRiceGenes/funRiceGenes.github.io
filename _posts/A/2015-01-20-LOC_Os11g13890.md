* **Key message**  
    + LHCB5 phosphorylation enhances broad-spectrum resistance of rice to M
    + We also show that LHCB5 phosphorylation-induced resistance is inheritable
    + Here, we report that the light-harvesting complex II protein, LHCB5, from rice is subject to light-induced phosphorylation during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae We demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LHCB5 promoter control the expression of LHCB5, which in turn correlates with the phosphorylation of LHCB5
