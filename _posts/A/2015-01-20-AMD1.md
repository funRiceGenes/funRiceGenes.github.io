* **Key message**  
    + AMD1 encodes a grass-specific protein exhibiting transactivation activity in the nucleus and is spatiotemporally expressed in the tapetum and microspores during pollen development
    + Taken together, we demonstrate that AMD1 is an important regulatory component involved in the TDR-mediated regulatory pathway to regulate sporopollenin biosynthesis, tapetum degradation, and exine formation for pollen development
    + Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation
    + Additionally, AMD1 directly interacts with TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), a key TF involved in the regulation of tapetum degradation and exine formation
