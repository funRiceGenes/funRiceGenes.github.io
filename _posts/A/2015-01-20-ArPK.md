* **Key message**  
    + Al specifically and rapidly upregulated ODC1 expression and causes overaccumulation of putrescine (Put), whereas the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine reverted Al-sensitive phenotype of arpk, suggesting that overaccumulation of endogenous Put might be harmful for root growth, and that ArPK seems to act as an endogenous inhibitor of ODC1 action to maintain suitable endogenous Put level under Al treatment
    + Overall, we identified ArPK and its putative repressive role in controlling a novel ODC-dependent Put biosynthesis pathway specifically affecting rice Al resistance, thus enriching the fundamental understanding of plant Al resistance
