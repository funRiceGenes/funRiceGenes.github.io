* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, polysome profiling assays suggest that the translational status remains unaffected in the aet1 mutant, but that the translational efficiency of OsARF19 and OsARF23 is reduced; moreover, the OsARF23 protein levels are obviously decreased in the aet1 mutant under high temperature, implying that AET1 regulates auxin signaling in response to high temperature
    + Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that AET1 plays a dual function in tRNA modification and translational control involved in the regulation of the environmental temperature response in rice
