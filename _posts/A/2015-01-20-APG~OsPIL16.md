* **Key message**  
    + Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length
    + PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo
    + These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG
    + An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG
    + PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1
    + Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
    + Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein OsPIL16 in Rice.
    + Based on these results, we propose that phyB deficiency positively regulates OsDREB1 expression through OsPIL16 to enhance cell membrane integrity and to reduce the malondialdehyde concentration, resulting in the improved cold tolerance of the phyB mutants
    + Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPIL16 transcripts were induced by cold stress and was significantly higher in the phyB mutant than in the WT
