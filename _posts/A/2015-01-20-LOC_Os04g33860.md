* **Publication**  
    + [Overexpression of ACL1 abaxially curled leaf 1 increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of ACL1 abaxially curled leaf 1 increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2010, Mol Plant.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [CT831358](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CT831358)

* **Key message**  
    + The T-DNA was inserted in the promoter of a novel gene, ACL1 (Abaxially Curled Leaf 1), and led to overexpression of this gene in BY240
    + Overexpression of ACL1 in wild-type rice also resulted in abaxial leaf curling
    + Overexpression of ACL2, the only homolog of ACL1 in rice, also induced abaxial leaf curling
    + Overexpression of ACL1 (abaxially curled leaf 1) increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __ACL1__, __ACL2__, [Overexpression of ACL1 abaxially curled leaf 1 increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of ACL1 abaxially curled leaf 1 increased Bulliform cells and induced Abaxial curling of leaf blades in rice%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression of ACL2, the only homolog of ACL1 in rice, also induced abaxial leaf curling
