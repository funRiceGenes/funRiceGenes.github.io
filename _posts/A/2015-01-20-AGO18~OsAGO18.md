## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression of miR168-resistant AGO1a in ago18 background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity |  Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi
