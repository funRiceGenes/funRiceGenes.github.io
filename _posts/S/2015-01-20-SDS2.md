* **Key message**  
    + Conversely, SDS2 over-expression induces constitutive PCD accompanied by elevated immune responses and enhanced resistance to M
    + An sds2 mutant shows reduced immune responses and enhanced susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae
    + The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.
    + In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production

* **Connection**  
    + __OsrbohB~Osrboh7__, __SDS2__, [The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production
    + __SDS2__, __SPL11__, [The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We show that SPL11 cell-death suppressor 2 (SDS2), an S-domain receptor-like kinase, positively regulates PCD and immunity in rice by engaging and regulating SPL11 and related kinases controlling defense responses
    + __SDS2__, __SPL11__, [The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  SDS2 interacts with and phosphorylates SPL11, which in turn ubiquitinates SDS2, leading to its degradation
    + __SDS2__, __SPL11__, [The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, a plasma membrane-resident protein complex consisting of SDS2, SPL11, and OsRLCK118/176 controls PCD and immunity in rice
