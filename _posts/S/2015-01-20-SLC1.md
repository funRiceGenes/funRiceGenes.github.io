    + [Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2019, J Exp Bot.

* **Key message**  
    + Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development
    + Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.
    + Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, SLC1 (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Collectively, our data revealed the importance of SLC1 and SLC2 in the shoot development of rice
    + Disruption of SLC1 or SLC2 led to dwarf plants
    + Enhanced SA level in the SLC1-OE plants and decreased SA level in the slc1 and slc2 mutants were scored

    + __OSH1~Oskn1__, __SLC1__, [Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two dioxygenases, SLC1 and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The results from exploring the putative interacting proteins for SLC1 indicated that, either the KNOX1- or ELK-domain of OSH1 (homeobox1) is sufficient for accomplishing the interaction between SLC1 and OSH1
    + __OsSLC1__, __SLC1__, [OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.%5BTitle%5D),  Map-based cloning of OsSLC1 revealed that a single base (G) deletion was detected in the first exon of Os06g0710800 in the slc1 mutant, which caused a premature stop codon
    + __OsSLC1__, __SLC1__, [OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival.%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout and complementation experiments further confirmed that OsSLC1 is responsible for the seedling-lethal chlorosis phenotype in the slc1 mutant
