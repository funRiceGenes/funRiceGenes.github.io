* **Key message**  
    + Collectively, our results indicate that STS1 is an important factor for lipid biosynthesis in reproduction, providing a target for the artificial control of male fertility in hybrid rice breeding and insight into the function of DUF726-containing protein in plants
    + Moreover, STS1 interacts with Polyketide Synthase 2 (OsPKS2) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase 12 (OsACOS12), two enzymes crucial in lipidic sporopollenin biosynthesis in pollen wall formation, suggesting a potentially lipidic metabolon for sporopollenin biosynthesis in rice
    + Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that STS1 is involved in anther lipid homeostasis
    + Genes involved in regulating fatty acid synthesis and formation of sporopollenin and pollen exine during anther development showed significantly different expression patterns in oslddt1 plants
    + oslddt1 plants show complete pollen abortion resulting from delayed degradation of the tapetum and blocked formation of Ubisch bodies and pollen walls
    + 22 % compared to WT, indicating that OsLDDT1 is involved in fatty acid synthesis and affects formation of the anther epidermis
    + Our results provide as deeper understanding of the role of OsLDDT1 in regulating male sterility and also provide materials for hybrid rice breeding
    + In this study, we isolated the male-sterile rice mutant oslddt1 (leaked and delayed degraded tapetum 1)
    + OsLDDT1 (LOC_Os03g02170) encodes a DUF726 containing protein of unknown function with highly conserved transmembrane and α/β Hydrolase domains
    + OsLDDT1, encoding a transmembrane structural DUF726 family protein, is essential for tapetum degradation and pollen formation in rice
