    + Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses
    + A stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC3 confers heat and drought tolerance through modulation of reactive oxygen species in rice.
    + Here, a stress-responsive NAC gene, SNAC3 (ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), conferring drought and heat tolerance in rice is reported
    + These results suggest that SNAC3 plays important roles in stress responses, and it is likely to be useful for engineering crops with improved tolerance to heat and drought stress
    + SNAC3 was ubiquitously expressed and its transcript level was induced by drought, high temperature, salinity stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + The SNAC3-OE transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), and relative electrolyte leakage than the wild-type control under heat stress conditions, implying that SNAC3 may confer stress tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis
    + NAC transcription factor ONAC066 positively regulates disease resistance by suppressing the ABA signaling pathway in rice
    + Overexpression of ONAC066 quantitatively enhances resistance to blast disease and bacterial blight in rice
    + Taken together, our results suggest that ONAC066 positively regulates rice resistance to blast and bacterial blight, and ONAC066 exerts its functions on disease resistance by modulating of ABA signaling pathway, sugars and amino acids accumulation in rice
    + Consistently, lower endogenous ABA levels are identified in ONAC066 overexpressing plants compared with wild-type plants before and after blast inoculation, while no significant differences are observed for the SA and JA levels
    + Further analysis shows that overexpression of ONAC066 remarkably suppresses the expression of ABA-related genes, whereas there  are no obvious differences for salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-related genes between wild-type and ONAC066 overexpressing plants
    + Here we report that the NAC gene ONAC066 (LOC_Os01g09550) is significantly activated by rice blast infection
    + ONAC066 is ubiquitously expressed and this protein is localized in the nucleus
    + Moreover, the metabolomic study reveals that the ONAC066 overexpressing plants accumulated higher contents of soluble sugars and amino acids both before and after pathogen attack, when compared to wild-type plants
    + Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) strongly activates the transcription of ONAC066 in rice
    + Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC066 functions as a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress response.
    + Overexpression of ONAC066 in transgenic rice improved drought and oxidative stress tolerance and increased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with decreased rate of water loss, increased contents of proline and soluble sugars, decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition
    + By contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of ONAC066 attenuated drought and oxidative stress tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with increased rate of water loss, decreased contents of proline and soluble sugars, elevated accumulation of ROS and downregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition
    + Functional analyses using overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression transgenic lines demonstrate that ONAC066 is a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice
    + ONAC066 is a nucleus-localized transcription activator that can respond to multiple abiotic stress factors
    + Expression of ONAC066 was significantly induced by PEG, NaCl, H2O2 and abscisic acid (ABA)
    + ONAC066 was localized in nuclei of cells when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and is a transcription activator with the binding ability to NAC recognition sequence (NACRS) and AtJUB1 binding site (JBS)
    + Knockout of the OsNAC006 Transcription Factor Causes Drought and Heat Sensitivity in Rice.
    + Furthermore, knockout of OsNAC006 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system resulted in drought and heat sensitivity
    + Our findings elucidate the important role of OsNAC006 in drought responses, and provide valuable information for genetic manipulation to enhance stress tolerance in future plant breeding programs
    + Herein, we discovered that the TF OsNAC006 is constitutively expressed in rice, and regulated by H2O2, cold, heat, abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA), NaCl, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatments
    + The present study investigated the function and mechanism of ONAC066 in rice immunity
    + ONAC066 shows transcription activator activity that depends on its C-terminal region in rice cells
