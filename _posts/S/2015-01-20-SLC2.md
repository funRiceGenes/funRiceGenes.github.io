* **Key message**  
    + Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development
    + Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, SLC1 (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Collectively, our data revealed the importance of SLC1 and SLC2 in the shoot development of rice
    + Disruption of SLC1 or SLC2 led to dwarf plants
    + Enhanced SA level in the SLC1-OE plants and decreased SA level in the slc1 and slc2 mutants were scored
