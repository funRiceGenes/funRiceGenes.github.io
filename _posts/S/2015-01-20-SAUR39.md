## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cytokinin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of the rice Oryza sativa SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
2. __yield__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
3. __salinity__, ["SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice"%5BTitle%5D), " The expression of the rice Oryza sativa SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia"
4. __growth__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
5. __auxin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of the rice Oryza sativa SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
6. __auxin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region
7. __auxin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, the results suggest that SAUR39 acts as a negative regulator for auxin synthesis and transport
8. __auxin__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D), SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice
9. __nitrogen__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of the rice Oryza sativa SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
10. __root__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
11. __shoot__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
12. __meristem__, [SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region
