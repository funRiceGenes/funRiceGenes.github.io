* **Key message**  
    + The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants
    + The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region
    + Taken together, the results suggest that SAUR39 acts as a negative regulator for auxin synthesis and transport
    + SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice
