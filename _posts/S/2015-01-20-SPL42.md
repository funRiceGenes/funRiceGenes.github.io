* **Key message**  
    + Consistently, multiple genes related to chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis were significantly down-regulated, whereas many genes involved in leaf senescence, ROS production, and defense responses were upregulated in the spl42 mutant
    + SPL42 targets to the chloroplast and interacts with the multiple organelle RNA editing factors (MORFs) OsMORF8-1 and OsMORF8-2 to affect RNA editing
    + Map-based cloning revealed that SPL42 encodes a PBGD
    + The identification and characterization of spl42 helps in elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with chlorophyll synthesis and RNA editing in rice
