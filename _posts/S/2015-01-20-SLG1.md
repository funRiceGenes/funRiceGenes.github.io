* **Key message**  
    + Dysfunction of SLG1 results in plants with thermosensitive phenotype, while overexpression of SLG1 enhances the tolerance of plants to high temperature
    + SLG1 plays a key role in the response of rice plants to high-temperature stress at both seedling and reproductive stages
    + Natural variations of SLG1 confer high-temperature tolerance in indica rice
    + Our results demonstrate that the allelic differentiation of SLG1 confers indica rice to high-temperature tolerance, and tRNA thiolation pathway might be a potential target in the next generation rice breeding for the warming globe
