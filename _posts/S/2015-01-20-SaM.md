## Key message
1. __pollen__, [Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes%5BTitle%5D),  Male semi-sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM-)  
2. __sterility__, [Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
3. __sterility__, [Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes%5BTitle%5D),  Male semi-sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM-)  
4. __sterility__, [Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes%5BTitle%5D),  This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF+ with SaM-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM+ because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM+ is required for this male sterility

## Connection

2. __SaF__, __SaM__, [Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes%5BTitle%5D),  Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM+SaF+), whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM-SaF- that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice
3. __SaF__, __SaM__, [Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes%5BTitle%5D),  This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF+ with SaM-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM+ because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM+ is required for this male sterility
