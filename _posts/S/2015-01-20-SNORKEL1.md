* **Information**  
    + Symbol: SNORKEL1  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water%5BTitle%5D), 2009, Nature.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The products of SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 then trigger remarkable internode elongation via gibberellin
    + Here we show the molecular mechanism of deepwater response through the identification of the genes SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2, which trigger deepwater response by encoding ethylene response factors involved in ethylene signalling
    + The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water
