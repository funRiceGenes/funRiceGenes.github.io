## Connection
1. __Sub1A__, __Sub1C__, [Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond%5BTitle%5D),  The objectives of this study were to a develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, b assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, c determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and d assess the level of tolerance in F1 hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele

3. __Sub1A__, __Sub1C__, [Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond%5BTitle%5D),  An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant
4. __Sub1A__, __Sub1C__, [Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond%5BTitle%5D),  Sub1A is confirmed as the primary contributor to tolerance, while Sub1C alleles do not seem important
5. __Sub1A__, __Sub1C__, [Expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C transcription factors in Arabidopsis uncovers flowering inhibition as a submergence tolerance mechanism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C transcription factors in Arabidopsis uncovers flowering inhibition as a submergence tolerance mechanism%5BTitle%5D),  SUB1 encodes two or three transcription factors of the group VII ethylene response factor family: SUB1A, SUB1B and SUB1C
