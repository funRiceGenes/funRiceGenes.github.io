* **Key message**  
    + SUB1C is invariably present and acts downstream of the enhancement of GA responsiveness during submergence
    + Expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C transcription factors in Arabidopsis uncovers flowering inhibition as a submergence tolerance mechanism
    + SUB1 encodes two or three transcription factors of the group VII ethylene response factor family: SUB1A, SUB1B and SUB1C
    + The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F(1) hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele

    + __Sub1A__, __Sub1C__, [Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond%5BTitle%5D), An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant
