## Expression information

## Key message
1. __ BR __, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the endogenous BR level in the SG1 overexpressor (SG1:OX) plants was comparable to the wild type
2. __brassinosteroid__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
3. __seed__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these results suggest that SG1 decreases responses to BRs and elongation of organs such as seeds and the internodes of rachis branches through decreased cellular proliferation
4. __dwarf__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
5. __panicle__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The causative gene, SG1, encodes a protein with unknown function that is preferentially expressed in roots and developing panicles
6. __lamina__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  SG1:OX plants were insensitive to brassinolide in the lamina inclination assay
7. __root__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The causative gene, SG1, encodes a protein with unknown function that is preferentially expressed in roots and developing panicles
8. __erect__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
9. __cellular proliferation__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these results suggest that SG1 decreases responses to BRs and elongation of organs such as seeds and the internodes of rachis branches through decreased cellular proliferation
10. __grain__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We identified a short-grain mutant (Short grain1 (Sg1) Dominant) via phenotypic screening of 13,000 rice (Oryza sativa) activation-tagged lines
11. __grain__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves
12. __grain__, [Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SG1:OX plants, RNA interference knockdown plants that down-regulated SG1 and a related gene, SG1-LIKE PROTEIN1, had longer grains and internodes in rachis branches than in the wild type
