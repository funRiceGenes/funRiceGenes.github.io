* **Key message**  
    + Molecular characterization reveals that OsSAPK3 improves drought tolerance and grain yield in rice.
    + All gronomic traits analyses demonstrated that OsSAPK3 could improve rice yield by affecting the regulation of tiller numbers and grain size
    + More interestingly, OsSAPK3 could improve rice yield by indirectly regulating tiller number and grain size
    + Physiological and metabolic analyses showed that OsSAPK3 might play an important role in drought stress signaling pathway by affecting osmotic adjustment and osmolytes, ROS detoxification and expression of ABA dependent and independent dehydration-responsive genes
    + CONCLUSION: OsSAPK3 plays an important role in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent drought stress responses
    + RESULTS: The expression of OsSAPK3 was up regulated by drought, NaCl, PEG and ABA
    + OsSAPK3 mutated seedings (sapk3-1 and sapk3-2) showed reduced hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA
