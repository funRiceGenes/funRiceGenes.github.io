* **Key message**  
    + ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
    + In this study we analyzed a novel dwarf mutant, ssd1, of which phenotype is different from typical GA- or BR-related dwarf phenotype
    + Map-based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in ssd1 mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function
    + ssd1 also shows abnormal cell files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant
    + Our results demonstrate that SSD1 controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants
    + SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice
