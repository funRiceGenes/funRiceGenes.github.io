## Key message
1. __root__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
2. __dwarf__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this study we analyzed a novel dwarf mutant, ssd1, of which phenotype is different from typical GA- or BR-related dwarf phenotype
3. __dwarf__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Map-based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in ssd1 mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function
4. __flower__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
5. __stem__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
6. __cell division__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  ssd1 also shows abnormal cell files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant
7. __cell division__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Our results demonstrate that SSD1 controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants
8. __cell division__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D), SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice
