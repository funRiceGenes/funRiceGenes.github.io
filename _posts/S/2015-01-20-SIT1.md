* **Key message**  
    + The Receptor-Like Kinase SIT1 Mediates Salt Sensitivity by Activating MAPK3/6 and Regulating Ethylene Homeostasis in Rice
    + Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa) Salt Intolerance 1 (SIT1), a lectin receptor-like kinase expressed mainly in root epidermal cells, mediates salt sensitivity.
    + SIT1 mediates ethylene production and salt-induced ethylene signaling. SIT1 promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to growth inhibition and plant death under salt stress, which occurred in an MPK3/6- and ethylene signaling-dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    + Consequently, by blocking SIT1 phosphorylation, B'κ inhibits and fine tunes SIT1 activity to balance plant growth and stress adaptation
    + Mutual regulation of receptor-like kinase SIT1 and B'κ-PP2A shapes the early response of rice to salt stress.
    + The receptor-like kinase SIT1 acts as a sensor in rice roots, relaying salt stress signals via elevated kinase activity to enhance salt sensitivity
    + Here, we demonstrate that Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit B'κ constrains SIT1 activity under salt stress
    + During early salt stress, activated SIT1 phosphorylates B'κ; this not only enhances its binding with SIT1, it also promotes B'κ protein accumulation via Ser502 phosphorylation
    + B'κ-PP2A deactivates SIT1 directly by dephosphorylating the kinase at Thr515/516, a salt-induced phosphorylation site in the activation loop that is essential for SIT1 activity
