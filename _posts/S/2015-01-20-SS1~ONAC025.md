* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, rice transgenic plants ectopically expressing SS1/ ONAC025 have a plantlet lethal phenotype with hampered vegetative growth, but increased tillers and an altered shoot apical meristem structure.
    + The article shows that SS1/ ONAC025 is a seed‚Äêspecific gene promoting grain filling in rice, and negatively affecting vegetative growth.
    + In short, the expression pattern of the reporter gene, driven by the promoter of SS1/ ONAC025, indicated an important role of this gene in seed development, which has been explored in detail in this paper.
    + A repression in the activation ability of rGAL4 on fusion with SS1/ ONAC025 suggests that SS1/ ONAC025 functions as a transcriptional repressor in yeast.
