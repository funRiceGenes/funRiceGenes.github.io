* **Key message**  
    + The higher accumulations for SRWD2 and SRWD3 mRNAs in all rice tissues detected suggested they might play basic roles in maintaining cellular activities, such as cytoskeletal dynamics, protein trafficking, nuclear export, ribosomal RNA biogenesis and chromatin modification and transcription
