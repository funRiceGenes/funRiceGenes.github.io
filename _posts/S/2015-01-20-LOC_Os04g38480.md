    + Four tyrosine residues of the rice immune receptor XA21 are not required for interaction with the co-receptor OsSERK2 or resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + Regulation of Brassinosteroid Signaling and Salt Resistance by SERK2 and Potential Utilization for Crop Improvement in Rice
    + We generated multiple mutant alleles of SERK2 by CRISPR/Cas9 editing and show that knockout of SERK2 results in a compact structure accompanied with increased grain size
    + By contrast, overexpression of SERK2 significantly enhances grain size and salt stress resistance, importantly, without affecting plant architecture
    + Furthermore, while salt suppresses SERK2 transcription, the protein is greatly induced by salt stress
    + Here, we show that SERK2 as a BR signaling component is a potentially useful candidate for BR manipulation in rice
    + SERK2 is localized on plasma membrane and can interact with OsBRI1, the BR receptor, suggesting its conserved role as co-receptor in BR signaling
    + Taken together, we propose that the adverse condition induces SERK2 accumulation to enhance early BR signaling on plasma membrane in favor of the anti-stress response
    + Our results illustrate the great potentials of specific BR components such as SERK2 for crop improvement by utilizing flexible strategies
