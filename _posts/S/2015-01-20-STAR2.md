## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  STAR1 encodes a nucleotide binding domain, while STAR2 encodes a transmembrane domain, of a bacterial-type ATP binding cassette ABC transporter
2. __transporter__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results indicate that STAR1 and STAR2 form a complex that functions as an ABC transporter, which is required for detoxification of Al in rice
3. __root__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Both STAR1 and STAR2 are expressed mainly in the roots and are specifically induced by Al exposure
4. __root__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Expression in onion epidermal cells, rice protoplasts, and yeast showed that STAR1 interacts with STAR2 to form a complex that localizes to the vesicle membranes of all root cells, except for those in the epidermal layer of the mature zone
5. __Al tolerance__, [A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report that two genes, STAR1 for sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1 and STAR2, are responsible for Al tolerance in rice
