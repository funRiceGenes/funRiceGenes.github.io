* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In comparison with the wild-type plants, the SGL1:OX plants showed a 45% decrease in plant height due to a uniform decrease of culm internode elongation
    + Lengths of seeds, panicles, and internodes in the rachis branches were 17%, 39%, and 31% shorter than those of the wild-type plants, respectively, and all differences were statistically significant
    + Down-Regulation of Both SG1 and SGL1 Caused Elongation of Rice Seeds and of the Internodes between Spikelets in the Rachis Branches
