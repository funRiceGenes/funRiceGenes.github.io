## Expression information

## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 OSH15 and Histone4 were impaired
2. __growth__, [SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 OSH15 and Histone4 were impaired
