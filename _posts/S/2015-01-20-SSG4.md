* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we report a novel rice (Oryza sativa) mutant called substandard starch grain4 (ssg4) that develops enlarged SGs in the endosperm
    + Enlargement of SGs in ssg4 was also observed in other starch-accumulating tissues such as pollen grains, root caps, and young pericarps
    + SSG4 will be a useful molecular tool for future starch breeding and biotechnology
