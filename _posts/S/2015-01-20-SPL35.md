* **Key message**  
    + spl35 exhibited decreased chlorophyll content, higher accumulation of H2 O2 , up-regulated expression of defence-related marker genes, and enhanced resistance to both fungal and bacterial pathogens of rice
    + SPL35 directly interacts with the E2 protein OsUBC5a and the coatomer subunit delta proteins Delta-COP1 and Delta-COP2 through the CUE domain, and down-regulation of these interacting proteins also cause development of HR-like lesions resembling those in spl35 and activation of defence responses, indicating that SPL35 may be involved in the ubiquitination and vesicular trafficking pathways
    + Our findings provide insight into a role of SPL35 in regulating cell death and defence response in plants
    + The SPL35 gene encodes a novel CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation) domain-containing protein that is predominantly localized in cytosol, ER and unknown punctate compartment(s)
    + SPL35 is constitutively expressed in all organs, and both overexpression and knockdown of SPL35 cause the lesion mimic phenotype

    + __OsLMP1~OsUBP2~LMM22__, __SPL35__, [A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  LMM22 interacts with SPOTTED LEAF 35 (SPL35), a coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation domain-containing protein that is known to participate in ubiquitination and the regulation of cell death and disease response in rice
    + __OsLMP1~OsUBP2~LMM22__, __SPL35__, [A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Additional analyses suggest that LMM22 can positively regulate and stabilise the abundance of SPL35 protein likely through its deubiquitination activity
    + __OsLMP1~OsUBP2~LMM22__, __SPL35__, [A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A ubiquitin-specific protease functions in regulating cell death and immune responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These data therefore improve our understanding of the function of UBP in rice innate immune responses by demonstrating that LMM22 functions as a critical regulator of SPL35 in cell death and disease resistance
