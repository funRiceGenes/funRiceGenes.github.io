* **Key message**  
    + Our findings support a model in which SP3 regulates panicle architecture by modulating cytokinin homeostasis
    + SP3 both up- and down-regulates expression of genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively
    + Consequently, cytokinin concentrations are decreased in young sp3 panicles, thereby leading to small panicles having fewer branches and spikelets
    + SP3 acts as a negative regulator of inflorescence meristem abortion by upregulating APO2/RFL
    + SP3 encodes a DNA binding with one finger (Dof) transcriptional activator
