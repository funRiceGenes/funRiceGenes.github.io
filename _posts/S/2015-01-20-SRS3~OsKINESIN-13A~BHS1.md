* **Key message**  
    + Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
    + The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype (srs3) in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the SRS3 gene
    + Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type
    + The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type
    + The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction
    + Thus, our results suggest that OsKinesin-13A utilizes its microtubule depolymerization activity to promote microtubule turnover, which may not only influence transverse orientation of cortical microtubules but also facilitate vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and thus affects cellulose microfibril orientation and cell elongation
    + OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.
    + An EMS-induced new sequence variant, TEMS5032, in the coding region of SRS3 gene leads to shorter grain length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + In the present study, we characterized and mapped a short and bold grained mutant and named it as TEMS5032, as the mutant is a result of EMS-induced transition from C to T at the 5032nd bp of SRS3 gene, which is known to affect grain size in rice
    + BHS1 was down-regulated at RNA and protein level upon exogenous BR treatment, and proteasome inhibitor MG132 delayed the BHS1 degradation, indicating that both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation machineries are involved in BHS1-mediated regulation of plant growth and development
    + BHS1 encodes the kinesin-13a protein and regulates grain length
    + We found that bhs1 was hypersensitive to BR, while BHS1-overexpression was less sensitive to BR compare to WT
    + Together, these results suggest that BHS1 is a novel component which is involved in negative regulation of the BR signaling downstream player of BRI1
