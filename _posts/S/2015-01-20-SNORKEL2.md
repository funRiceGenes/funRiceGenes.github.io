## Key message
1. __ethylene__, [The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show the molecular mechanism of deepwater response through the identification of the genes SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2, which trigger deepwater response by encoding ethylene response factors involved in ethylene signalling
2. __ethylene__, [The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water%5BTitle%5D), The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water
3. __gibberellin__, [The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water%5BTitle%5D),  The products of SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 then trigger remarkable internode elongation via gibberellin
