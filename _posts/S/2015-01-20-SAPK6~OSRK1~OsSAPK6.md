* **Key message**  
    + The OSRK1 transcript level was undetectable in vegetative tissues, but significantly increased by hyperosmotic stress and Abscisic acid (ABA)
    + Finally, ectopic expression of OSRK1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in a reduced sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and root elongation
    + Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions
    + These findings suggest that OSRK1 is associated with ABA signaling, possibly through the phosphorylation of ABF family in vivo
    + Interestingly, OSRK1 showed strong substrate preference for rice bZIP transcription factors and uncommon cofactor requirement for Mn(2+) over Mg(2+)
    + Co-overexpression of the Constitutively Active Form of OsbZIP46 and ABA-Activated Protein Kinase SAPK6 Improves Drought and Temperature Stress Resistance in Rice.
    + Chilling-induced phosphorylation of IPA1 by OsSAPK6 activates chilling tolerance responses in rice.
    + The function of OsSAPK6 in chilling tolerance depended on IPA1, and overexpression of OsCBF3 could rescue the chilling-sensitive phenotype of ipa1 loss-of-function mutant
    + Under chilling stress, OsSAPK6 could phosphorylate IPA1 and increase its stability
