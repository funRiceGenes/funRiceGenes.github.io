## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway
2. __shoot__, [Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3)
3. __shoot__, [The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM
4. __leaf__, [Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3)
5. __leaf__, [The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway

6. __OsDCL1__, __SHO1~OsDCL4__, [Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, all miRNAs tested were greatly reduced in OsDCL1IR but not OsDCL4IR transformants, indicating that OsDCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA processing in rice
7. __OsDCL1__, __SHO1~OsDCL4__, [Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, the production of siRNA from transgenic inverted repeats and endogenous CentO regions were not affected in either OsDCL1IR or OsDCL4IR transformants, suggesting that the production of miRNAs and siRNAs is via distinct OsDCLs
