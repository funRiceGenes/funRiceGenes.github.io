* **Key message**  
    + STK was highest expressed in the stem at the heading stage
    + Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase STK Confers Salt Tolerance in Rice.
    + Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of an RLCK gene SALT TOLERANCE KINASE (STK) enhances salt tolerance in rice, and that STK may regulate the expression of GST (Glutathione S-transferase) genes
    + Overexpression of STK in rice increased tolerance to salt stress and oxidative stress by increasing ROS scavenging ability and ABA sensitivity
    + In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of STK increased the sensitivity of rice to salt stress and oxidative stress
    + Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that STK increased the expression of GST genes (LOC_Os03g17480, LOC_Os10g38140 and LOC_Os10g38710) under salt stress
    + CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that STK plays a positive regulatory role in salt stress tolerance by inducing antioxidant defense and associated with the ABA signaling pathway in rice
    + RESULTS: The expression of STK was rapidly induced by ABA
    + STK was localized at the plasma membrane
