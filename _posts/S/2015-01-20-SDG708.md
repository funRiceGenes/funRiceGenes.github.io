## Publication
1. [SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice Oryza sativa.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice Oryza sativa.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, New Phytol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In fact, knockdown of SDG708 led to misexpression of a set of functional genes and a genome-wide decrease in H3K36me1/2/3 levels during the early growth stages of rice  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:

2. __methyltransferase__, [SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice Oryza sativa.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice Oryza sativa.%5BTitle%5D),  SDG708 is a methyltransferase that catalyses genome-wide deposition of all three methyl groups on H3K36 and is involved in many biological processes in addition to flowering promotion
