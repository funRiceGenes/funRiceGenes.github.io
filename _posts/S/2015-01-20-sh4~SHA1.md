## Expression information
__Expression__:Multiple tissue-specific expression of rice seed-shattering gene SH4 regulated by its promoter pSH4. |  We isolated and ligated pSH4 to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed it into a japonica rice cultivar to determine the multiple expression pattern of SH4 |  Histochemical location and fluorescence analyses of GUS activity of transgenic plants indicated multiple tissue-specific expression of pSH4 in the seed-pedicel junction region of mature panicles (with highest level), stems, coleoptiles of germinated seeds, and scutella of mature seeds | The multiple tissue-specific expression pSH4 is categorized as a spatiotemporal promoter that drives the expression of the SH4 gene in different rice tissues, in addition to the seed-pedicel junction region

## Key message
1. __seed__, [Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (SHA1), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors
2. __seed__, [Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrate that the g237t mutation in SHA1 accounts for the elimination of seed shattering, and that all the domesticated rice cultivars harbor the mutant sha1 gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity
3. __transcription factor__, [Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4
4. __domestication__, [Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  The sh4 phylogeny together with the neutrality tests and coalescent simulations suggested that sh4 had a single origin and was fixed by artificial selection during the domestication of rice
