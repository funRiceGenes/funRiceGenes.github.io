* **Key message**  
    + SPL6 represses signalling outputs of ER stress in control of panicle cell death in rice.
    + Here, we report that SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 6 (SPL6)-deficient plants displayed hyperactivation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1, leading to cell death in rice panicles, indicating that SPL6 is an essential survival factor for the suppression of persistent or intense ER stress conditions
    + Our findings reveal a novel cell survival machinery in which SPL6 represses the transcriptional activation of the ER stress sensor IRE1 in control of ER stress signalling outputs that hinge on a balance between adaptive and death signals for determining cell fates during ER stress
