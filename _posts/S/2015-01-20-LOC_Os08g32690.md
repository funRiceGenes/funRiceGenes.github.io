* **Key message**  
    + SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development
    + We isolated a recessive mutant named super apical dormant (sad1-1) from a suppressor screen of d14-1.

* **Connection**  
    + __OsMED4__, __SAD1__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D), Here we show that SAD1 interacts physically with the Mediator complex through a direct binding with OsMED4, a component of the middle module of the Mediator complex in rice.
