* **Key message**  
    + Alleviation of seed germination inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, as well as the induction of antioxidant defense were further observed when SE5 or HY1 was overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that SE5 may be useful for molecular breeding designed to improve plant tolerance to oxidative stress
    + Here, we show that the s73 mutant, identified in a gamma-irradiated Bahia collection, displays early flowering and photoperiodic insensitivity due to a null mutation in the PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 (SE5) gene, which encodes an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis
    + Normal grown ygl2 seedlings showed yellow-green leaves with reduced contents of Chl and tetrapyrrole intermediates whereas an increase of Chl a/b ratio
    + Compared with wild-type, SE5 RNAi transgenic plants aggravated seedling growth inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, and decreased the transcripts of some representative antioxidative genes
    + Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants
    + The herbicide methyl viologen (MV), which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), was applied to determine whether SE5 regulates oxidative stress response
    + In addition, we found expression levels of some genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were concurrently altered in ygl2 mutant
    + Rice RNAi mutants silenced for SE5 were generated and displayed early flowering under long-day conditions, consistent with phenotypes of the null mutation in SE5 gene reported previously (se5 and s73)
    + RNAi knockdown of rice SE5 gene is sensitive to the herbicide methyl viologen by the down-regulation of antioxidant defense
    + YGL2 was constitutively expressed in a variety of rice tissues with the highest levels in leaves and regulated by temperature
    + Here, we identified that the rice PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 5 (SE5) gene, which encoded a putative HO with high similarity to HO-1 from Arabidopsis (HY1), exhibited HO activity, and localized in the chloroplasts
    + In this study, we isolated a rice mutant named yellow-green leaf 2 (ygl2) from a (60)Co-irradiated population
    + Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated grana were poorly stacked in ygl2 mutant, resulting in underdevelopment of chloroplasts
    + The photoperiodic sensitivity 5 (se5) mutant of rice, a short-day plant, has a very early flowering phenotype and is completely deficient in photoperiodic response
    + Comparison of se5 with hy1, a counterpart mutant of Arabidopsis, suggests distinct roles of phytochromes in the photoperiodic control of flowering in these two species
    + Here, we identified a rice mutant, yellow leaf and early flowering (ye1), and characterized the gene YE1 by using a map-based cloning method
    + Furthermore, the expression levels of Chl biosynthetic genes were downregulated in ye1 seedlings during de-etiolation responses to light
    + Map-Based Cloning and Functional Analysis of YE1 in Rice, Which Is Involved in Light-Dependent Chlorophyll Biogenesis and Photoperiodic Flowering Pathway.
    + Expression pattern analysis indicated that PE-1 was mainly expressed in roots, stems, leaves, leaf sheaths, and young panicles
    + Furthermore, the chloroplasts of pe-1 were filled with many large-sized starch grains, and the number of osmiophilic granules (a chloroplast lipid reservoir) was significantly decreased
    + The pe-1 plant is accompanied by a decreased chlorophyll content, an enhanced photosynthesis, and a decreased pollen fertility
