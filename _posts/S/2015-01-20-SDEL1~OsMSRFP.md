* **Key message**  
    + Consistent with this biochemical function of SDEL1 and SDEL2, enhancing the expression of SDEL1 and SDEL2 results in Pi over-accumulation and induces Pi-starvation signaling even under Pi-sufficient conditions
    + Therefore SDEL1 and SDEL2 facilitate the degradation of SPX4 to modulate PHR2 activity and regulate Pi-homeostasis and Pi-signaling in response to external Pi availability in rice
    + OsMSRFP attenuated OsMYBc-mediated OsHKT1;1 expression, and knockout of OsMSRFP led to rice salt tolerance
