* **Key message**  
    + Genetic analyses indicate that SBI is a semi-dominant gene affecting rice height and lodging resistance
    + Breeding with higher activity of the SBI allele generates new rice varieties with improved lodging resistance and increased yield
    + The discovery of the SBI provides a desirable gene resource for producing semi-dwarf rice phenotypes and offers an effective strategy for breeding rice varieties with lodging resistance and high yield
    + SBI is predominantly expressed in culm basal internodes
    + SBI allelic variants display different activities and are associated with the height of rice varieties
