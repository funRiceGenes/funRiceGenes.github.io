## Expression information

## Key message
1. __nitrate__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter
2. __nitrate__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant
3. __transporter__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  Gene cloning and characterization indicate that SP1 encodes a putative transporter that belongs to the peptide transporter (PTR) family
4. __transporter__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter
5. __transporter__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant
6. __panicle__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report on a novel rice mutant, short panicle1 (sp1), which is defective in rice panicle elongation, and thus leads to the short-panicle phenotype
7. __panicle__, [Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size%5BTitle%5D),  The SP1 gene is highly expressed in the phloem of the branches of young panicles, which is consistent with the predicted function of SP1 and the sp1 phenotype
