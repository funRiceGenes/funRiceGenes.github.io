* **Key message**  
    + The sles phenotype differed from that of other LMMs in that lesion mimic spots were observed on the leaf sheath rather than on leaves
    + Taken together, our results revealed that SLES was associated with the formation of lesion mimic spots on the leaf sheath resulting early senescence and defense responses
    + Further examination of SLES will facilitate a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ROS homeostasis and may also provide opportunities to improve pathogen resistance in rice
