## Key message
1. __flowering time__, [The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Expression analyses of flowering time genes in wild-type and lvp1 mutants revealed that Early heading date1, but not Heading date1, are misregulated in lvp1 mutants
2. __flowering time__, [The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, the double mutant of lvp1 with photoperiod sensitivity5 se5 flowered later than the se5 single mutant, indicating that lvp1 delays flowering time irrespective of photoperiod
3. __vegetative__, [The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We identified a late-flowering long vegetative phase1 lvp1 mutant in rice and used map-based cloning to reveal that lvp1 affects the SET domain group protein 724 SDG724)
