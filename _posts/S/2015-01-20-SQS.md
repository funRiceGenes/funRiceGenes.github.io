## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  It is demonstrated that RNAi-mediated disruption of a rice farnesyltransferase/squalene synthase (SQS) by maize squalene synthase improves drought tolerance at both the vegetative and reproductive stages
2. __drought tolerance__, [RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  It is demonstrated that RNAi-mediated disruption of a rice farnesyltransferase/squalene synthase (SQS) by maize squalene synthase improves drought tolerance at both the vegetative and reproductive stages
3. __drought__, [RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  It is demonstrated that RNAi-mediated disruption of a rice farnesyltransferase/squalene synthase (SQS) by maize squalene synthase improves drought tolerance at both the vegetative and reproductive stages
4. __reproductive__, [RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  It is demonstrated that RNAi-mediated disruption of a rice farnesyltransferase/squalene synthase (SQS) by maize squalene synthase improves drought tolerance at both the vegetative and reproductive stages
