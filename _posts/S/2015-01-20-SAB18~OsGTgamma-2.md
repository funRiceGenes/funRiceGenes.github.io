* **Key message**  
    + The trihelix transcription factor OsGTgamma-2 is involved adaption to salt stress in rice.
    + The seed germination rate, seedling growth and survival rate under salinity stress was improved in OsGTgamma-2 overexpressing lines (PZmUbi::OsGTgamma-2)
    + OsGTgamma-2 specifically targeted the nucleus, was mainly expressed in roots, sheathes, stems and seeds, and was induced by salinity, osmotic and oxidative stresses and abscisic acid (ABA)
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsGTgamma-2 is an important positive regulator involved in rice responses to salt stress and suggest a potential role for OsGTgamma-2 in regulating salinity adaptation in rice
    + In response to salt stress, different Na+ and K+ acclamation patterns were observed in PZmUbi::OsGTgamma-2 lines and OsGTgamma-2 plants were observed
    + The molecular mechanism of OsGTgamma-2 in rice salt adaptation was also investigated
