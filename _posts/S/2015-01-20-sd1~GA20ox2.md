## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis%5BTitle%5D),  The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 GA20 oxidase expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function
2. __ ga __, [The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis%5BTitle%5D),  The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 GA20 oxidase expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function

4. __ ga __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling
