* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired
    + We have characterized an early senile mutant es5 (early leaf senescence 5) in rice exhibiting leaf yellowing phenotype after the 4-leaf stage
    + ES5 is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylserine synthesis and impacts on early senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
