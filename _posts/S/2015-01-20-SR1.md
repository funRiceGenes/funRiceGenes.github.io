* **Key message**  
    + SR1 mutation affected the whole root-development process, producing shorter radicles, adventitious roots, and lateral roots, abnormal xylem development, causing dwarfing, and decreasing the water potential and moisture content
    + SR1 was largely expressed in the roots, but only in developing root meristems and tracheary elements
    + The membrane transport of the sr1 mutants was blocked, affecting cell division in the root apical region and root tracheary element development
    + The study of SR1 will deepen our understanding of the function of EXO70 genes in rice and guide future studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in plant root development
    + The shortness of the sr1 mutant roots was caused by the presence of fewer meristem cells
