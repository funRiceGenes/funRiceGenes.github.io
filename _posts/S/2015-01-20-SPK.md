* **Key message**  
    + Antisense SPK transformants lacked the ability to accumulate storage products such as starch, but produced watery seed with a large amount of Suc instead, as the result of an inhibition of Suc degradation
    + Rice SPK, a Calmodulin-Like Domain Protein Kinase, Is Required for Storage Product Accumulation during Seed Development: Phosphorylation of Sucrose Synthase Is a Possible Factor
    + Rice SPK, a calcium-dependent protein kinase, is expressed uniquely in the endosperm of immature seed, and its involvement in the biosynthetic pathways of storage products was suggested
    + A gene encoding a calcium-dependent seed-specific protein kinase (SPK) is abundantly expressed in developing rice seeds (Kawasaki, T et al
