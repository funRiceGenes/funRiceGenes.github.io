## Key message
1. __auxin__, [A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D),  SMOS1 expression was induced by exogenous auxin treatment, and the auxin response element AuxRE of the SMOS1 promoter acts as a cis-motif through interaction with auxin response factor ARF)  
2. __auxin__, [A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D),  We propose that SMOS1 acts as an auxin-dependent regulator for cell expansion during organ size control, and that its function is conserved among land plants
3. __organ size__, [A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we identified a new rice loss-of-function mutant, small organ size1 smos1), that decreases the final size of various organs due to decreased cell size and abnormal microtubule orientation
4. __organ size__, [A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, a functional fluorophore-tagged SMOS1 was localized to the nucleus, supporting the role of SMOS1 as a transcriptional regulator for organ size control
