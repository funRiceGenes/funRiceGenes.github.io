* **Key message**  
    + SRZ1 was expressed with high level in leaves and markedly repressed by salt, cold, drought and abcisic acid stresses but not by salicylic acid and blast inoculation in rice seedlings
    + Ectopic expression of SRZ1 in tobacco plants repressed expression of abiotic stress-related genes including osmotin, NtERB10B, NtERB10C, and increased plant sensitivity to cold and salt stresses
    + This study indicates that SRZ1 and its relatives in plants may play negative roles in abiotic stress signaling and the down-regulation of them might be crucial for plant tolerance against stresses
