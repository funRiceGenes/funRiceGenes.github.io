2. __phosphate__, [Characterization of a rice sucrose-phosphate synthase-encoding gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice sucrose-phosphate synthase-encoding gene%5BTitle%5D)), A rice genomic clone (sps1) coding for sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was isolated and sequenced
