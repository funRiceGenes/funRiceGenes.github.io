* **Key message**  
    + Significant changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in ethylene synthesis, which resulted in reduced content of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the sd38 mutant
    + Exogenously supplied VLCFA (C24:0) increased the expression levels of OsACS3, OsACS4, and OsACO7 and the plant height of sd38 mutant seedlings, similar to the effect of exogenous application of ACC and ethephon
