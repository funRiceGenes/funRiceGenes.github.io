* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning identified two allelic mutations in a gene encoding a GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE (GSL) protein, thus indicating a role for SEM1 in callose biosynthesis
    + In situ expression analysis and GUS staining showed that SEM1 was mainly expressed in vascular phloem cells
    + Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.
    + Subcellular localization in rice showed that SEM1 localized to the plasma membrane
    + Map-based cloning identified two allelic mutations in a gene encoding a GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE (GSL) protein, thus indicating a role for SEM1 in callose biosynthesis.
    + Reduced sucrose transport was found in the sem1-1/1-2 mutant, which led to excessive starch accumulation in source leaves and inhibited photosynthesis.
