* **Key message**  
    + Additionally, multiple agronomic traits of rice, including root length and flag leaf inclination, were affected by siR109944 expression
    + Our results demonstrate that siR109944 has a conserved function in interfering with plant immunity, growth and development by affecting auxin homeostasis in planta
    + Rice siR109944 suppresses plant immunity to sheath blight and impacts multiple agronomic traits by affecting auxin homeostasis.
    + Auxin metabolism- and signaling pathway-related genes were differentially expressed in the siR109944 OE and FBL55 OE plants
    + We found that rice had significantly enhanced susceptibility when siR109944 was overexpressed, while FBL55 OE plants showed resistance to R
    + Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing siR109944 exhibited early flowering, increased tiller numbers and increased susceptibility to R
    + Thus, siR109944 provides a genetic target for plant breeding in the future
