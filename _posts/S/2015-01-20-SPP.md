## Key message
1. __root__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
2. __chloroplast__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  Subcellular localization analysis indicates that SPP is targeted to the chloroplast
3. __chloroplast__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings
4. __chloroplast__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
5. __seedling__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings
6. __seedling__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  Western blot analysis revealed that the Rubisco small subunit is not precisely processed in the spp mutant in 7-day-old seedlings, but the processing activity in the spp mutant is restored in 14-day-old seedlings
7. __root development__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
8. __growth__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
