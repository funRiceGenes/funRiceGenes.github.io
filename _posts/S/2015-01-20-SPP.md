* **Key message**  
    + The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
    + Subcellular localization analysis indicates that SPP is targeted to the chloroplast
    + The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings
    + Western blot analysis revealed that the Rubisco small subunit is not precisely processed in the spp mutant in 7-day-old seedlings, but the processing activity in the spp mutant is restored in 14-day-old seedlings

    + __FZP~BFL1~SGDP7__, __SPP__, [Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The CNV-18bp duplication repressed FZP expression, prolonged the panicle branching period and increased grain yield by more than 15% through substantially increasing the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and slightly decreasing the 1,000-grain weight (TGW)
    + __FZP~BFL1~SGDP7__, __SPP__, [Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  These findings showed that the silencer CNVs coordinate a trade-off between SPP and TGW by fine-tuning FZP expression, and balancing the trade-off could enhance yield potential
    + __OsDER1__, __SPP__, [OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsDER1 associated with the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), a homologue of a component of the alternative ERAD pathway recently identified in yeast and mammals
    + __OsGBF1__, __SPP__, [Identification of splice variant of OsGBF1 in Oryza sativa ssp. indica genotypes under salinity stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of splice variant of OsGBF1 in Oryza sativa ssp. indica genotypes under salinity stress.%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we analyzed the expression of OsGBF1 during salt stress in two contrasting Oryza sativa spp
