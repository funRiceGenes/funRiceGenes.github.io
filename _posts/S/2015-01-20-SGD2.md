* **Key message**  
    + High performance liquid chromatography assays showed that the endogenous GA1 level in the sgd2 mutant was dramatically decreased, and exogenous GA3 recovered the second leaf sheath to normal length
    + Map-based cloning and complementation tests demonstrated that a 9 bp deletion in a homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) II family transcription factor was responsible for the sgd2 mutant phenotype
    + Expression of SGD2 was pronounced in developing panicles, and its protein was localized in nucleus
