## Key message
1. __plant development__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D), SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development
2. __development__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D), SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development
3. __super apical dormant__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D), We isolated a recessive mutant named super apical dormant sad1-1 from a suppressor screen of d14-1.

## Connection
1. __OsMED4__, __SAD1__, [SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development%5BTitle%5D), Here we show that SAD1 interacts physically with the Mediator complex through a direct binding with OsMED4, a component of the middle module of the Mediator complex in rice.
