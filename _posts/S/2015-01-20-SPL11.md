* **Key message**  
    + Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is induced in both incompatible and compatible rice-blast interactions
    + The rice (Oryza sativa) E3 ligase SPOTTED LEAF11 (SPL11) negatively regulates programmed cell death and disease resistance
    + The rice U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance, and controls flowering time through interacting with the novel RNA/DNA binding KH domain protein SPIN1
    + These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice
    + SPIN1, a K homology domain protein negatively regulated and ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11, is involved in flowering time control in rice
    + In vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant cell death and defense
    + We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor
    + We demonstrate here that SPL11 also regulates flowering via interaction with SPIN1 (for SPL11-interacting protein1), a Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA family member
    + Spl11 mutants have delayed flowering under long-day conditions
    + Our data are consistent with a model in which SPIN1 acts as a negative regulator of flowering that itself is negatively regulated by SPL11, possibly via ubiquitination
    + The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68 population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens
