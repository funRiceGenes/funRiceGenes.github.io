* **Key message**  
    + Subcellular localization assay showed that the ST2 protein was located in mitochondria
    + The ST2 gene was finely confined to a 27-kb region on chromosome 1 by the map-based cloning strategy and a 5-bp deletion in Os01g0765000 was identified by sequence analysis
    + The expression of nuclear and plastid genome replication genes was down-regulated under decreased dTTP, and together with decreased cell proliferation and defective chloroplast development in the alr mutant this demonstrated the molecular and physiological roles of DCD-mediated dNTP pool balance in plant development
    + ALR encoding dCMP deaminase is critical for DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression and plant development in rice.
    + Map-based cloning and complementation revealed that ALR encodes a DCD protein
