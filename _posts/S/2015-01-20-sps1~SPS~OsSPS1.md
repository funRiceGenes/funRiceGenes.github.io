* **Key message**  
    + In agreement with this hypothesis, transgenic rice plants with a maize SPS gene that had about 3 times the SPS activity of that in Nipponbare (control plants) were significantly taller than Nipponbare from the early growth stage
    + A rice genomic clone (sps1) coding for sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was isolated and sequenced
    + The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, OsSPS1 and OsSPS11, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose
    + The higher level of SPS transcripts and the activity of SPS in NIL6 compared to control plants, and the fact that the relative SPS activity per SPS protein content was almost the same between NIL6 and Nipponbare suggested that the higher plant height in NIL6 compared to Nipponbare was due to the high SPS activity in NIL6
    + During leaf development, the sps1 promoter directs a basipetal pattern of expression that coincides with the distribution of SPS activity during the leaf sink-to-source transition
    + It was also found that during the vegetative part of the growth cycle, SPS expression and enzymatic activity are highest in the youngest fully expanded leaf
    + Analysis of rice sps1 expression showed that mRNA levels change during leaf development
    + It was found that the expression of the rice sps1 gene is limited to mesophyll cells in leaves, the scutellum of germinating seedlings, and pollen of immature inflorescences
    + SPS plays a central role in the production of sucrose in photosynthetic cells and in the conversion of starch or fatty acids into sucrose in germinating seeds
    + Our previous study on the expression of the sucrose phosphate synthase gene family in rice (OsSPSs) suggested the involvement of sucrose sensing and/or circadian rhythm in the transcriptional regulation of OsSPS
    + SPS activity and mRNA were undetectable in roots
    + In a double knockout mutant of OsSPS1 and OsSPS11 (sps1/sps11), an 84% reduction in leaf SPS activity resulted in higher starch accumulation in the leaves than in the wild-type leaves
    + The knockdown and knockout mutants of OsSPS1 showed a 29-46% reduction in SPS activity in the leaves, but the carbohydrate content in the leaves and plant growth were not significantly different from those of wild-type plants
