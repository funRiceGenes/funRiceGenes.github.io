* **Key message**  
    + The variegated albino phenotype was caused by insertion and excision of nDart1-0 in the 5&#39;-untranslated region of the SWL1 gene predicted to encode an unknown protein with the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide
    + This study revealed that SWL1 is essential for the beginning of thylakoid membrane organization during chloroplast development
    + In the swl1 mutant, formations of grana and stroma thylakoids and prolamellar bodies were inhibited
