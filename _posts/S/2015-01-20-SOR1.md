* **Information**  
    + Symbol: SOR1  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os04g01160](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g01160)  
    + RAPdb: [Os04g0101800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0101800)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), 2013, Rice (N Y).

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Segregation analyses by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the soil-surface rooting mutant and wild-type Nipponbare indicated that the trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, designated as sor1
    + CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sor1, a rice mutant causing soil-surface rooting and altered root gravitropic response, is allelic to Os04g0101800, and that a 33-bp deletion in the coding region of this gene causes the mutant phenotypes

* **Connection**  
    + __OsIAA9__, __SOR1__, [E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.%5BTitle%5D),  SOR1 physically interacts with OsIAA26 and OsIAA9, which are atypical and canonical Aux/IAA proteins, respectively
    + __OsIAA9__, __SOR1__, [E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=E3 ubiquitin ligase SOR1 regulates ethylene response in rice root by modulating stability of Aux/IAA protein.%5BTitle%5D),  SOR1 targets OsIAA26 for ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas OsIAA9 protects the OsIAA26 protein from degradation by inhibiting the E3 activity of SOR1
