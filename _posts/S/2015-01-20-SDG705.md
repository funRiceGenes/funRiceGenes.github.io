* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report that SDG721 (SET-domain group protein 721) and SDG705 are involved in regulating rice development
    + Together, these results suggest that SDG721 and SDG705 regulate H3K4 methylation, which is crucial for plant development in rice
    + Loss of SDG721 and SDG705 function resulted in GA-deficient phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, reduced cell length, and reduced panicle branching
    + The transcripts levels and H3K4me3 levels of GA biosynthesis genes and GA signaling pathway genes were downregulated in the sdg721 sdg705 plants
