* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Genome-edited SD8 could optimize rice architecture by reducing plant height and flag leaf angle without yield penalty
    + Genome-edited ATP BINDING CASSETTE B1 transporter SD8 knockouts have optimized rice architecture without yield penalty.
    + Moreover, SD8 knockouts may even have the potential for increased yield under high density planting in rice
