* **Key message**  
    + Here we report the isolation and characterization of SEMI-ROLLED LEAF1 (SRL1), a gene involved in the regulation of leaf rolling
    + These results provide the transcript profile of rice leaf cells that will become bulliform cells and demonstrate that SRL1 regulates leaf rolling through inhibiting the formation of bulliform cells by negatively regulating the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunits and H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which will help to understand the mechanism regulating leaf rolling
