* **Key message**  
    + Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays indicated an interaction between SBDCP1 and starch synthase IIIa (SSIIIa), which was down-regulated at the protein level in the CS8 line
    + Furthermore, binding by SBDCP1 inhibited SSIIIa starch polymerization activity in a non-competitive manner
    + Surprisingly, artificial microRNA gene suppression of SBDCP1 restored protein expression levels of SSIIIa in the CS8 line resulting in starch with lower amylose content and increased amylopectin chains with a higher degree of polymerization
