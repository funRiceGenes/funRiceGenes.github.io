* **Key message**  
    + We found that STH1 regulates fatty acid metabolic homeostasis, probably by catalyzing the hydrolytic degradation of fatty acids, which contributes to salt tolerance
    + Meanwhile, we demonstrated that STH1 forms a protein complex with D3 and a vital regulatory factor in salt tolerance, OsHAL3, to regulate the protein abundance of OsHAL3 via the 26S proteasome pathway
    + Furthermore, we revealed that STH1 also serves as a co-activator with the floral integrator gene Heading date 1 to balance the expression of the florigen gene Heading date 3a under different circumstances, thus coordinating the regulation of salt tolerance and heading date
    + Notably, the allele of STH1 associated with enhanced salt tolerance and high yield is found in some African rice accessions but barely in Asian cultivars
