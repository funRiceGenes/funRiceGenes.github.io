* **Key message**  
    + Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
    + Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions
    + SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
    + The transcription factor OsSUF4 interacts with SDG725 in promoting H3K36me3 establishment.
    + Here, we show that the transcription factor OsSUF4 recognizes a specific 7-bp DNA element, broadly distributes throughout the rice genome, and recruits the H3K36 methyltransferase SDG725 to target a set of genes including the key florigen genes RFT1 and Hd3a to promote flowering in rice
    + Biochemical and structural analyses indicate that several positive residues within the zinc finger domain are vital for OsSUF4 function in planta
