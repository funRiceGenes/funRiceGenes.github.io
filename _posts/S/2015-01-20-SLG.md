* **Key message**  
    + SLG controls grain size and leaf angle by modulating brassinosteroid homeostasis in rice.
    + Moreover, SLG RNAi plants displayed mild BR-deficient phenotypes including shorter grains, smaller leaf angles, and compact semi-dwarf plant types
    + SLG is preferentially expressed in young panicles and lamina joints, implying its role in controlling cell growth in those two tissues
    + Taken together, we conclude that SLG is an important regulator in BR homeostasis and that manipulation of SLG expression to an optimal level may provide a way to develop an ideal plant type
    + Overexpression of SLG in d11-2 (deficient in BR synthesis) and d61-1 (deficient in BR signaling) did not change the existing phenotypes
