* **Key message**  
    + CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor SnRK1A (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater
    + Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice
    + The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice
    + OsSnRK1a overexpression interfered with normal growth and development and increased resistance against both (hemi)biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, while OsSnRK1a silencing in RNAi lines increased susceptibility
    + The energy sensor OsSnRK1a confers broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
    + OsSnRK1a overexpression positively affected the salicylic acid pathway and boosted the jasmonate-mediated defense response after inoculation with the blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae
    + Together these findings strongly suggest OsSnRK1a to be involved in plant basal immunity and favor a model whereby OsSnRK1a acts as a master switch that regulates growth-immunity trade-offs
    + Accelerated NSC transport was accompanied by increased levels of OsSnRK1a mRNA expression, SnRK1a protein expression, catalytic subunit phosphorylation of SnRK1, and SnRK1 activity, indicating that SnRK1 activity plays an important role in sheath NSC transport
    + Since SnRK1 activity is mostly regulated by OsSnRK1a transcription in response to low sucrose content, we constructed an snrk1a mutant to verify the function of SnRK1 in NSC transport
    + SnRK1A is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and positively regulates plant immune responses and disease resistance
    + As a central mediator of energy signaling, SnRK1A interacts with and phosphorylates XB24 at Thr83 residue to promote ATPase activity
    + Meanwhile, SCRE1 outcompetes SnRK1A for XB24 binding, and thereby suppresses SnRK1A-mediated phosphorylation and ATPase activity of XB24
    + In this study, using translational reporter constructs transfected in Arabidopsis protoplasts we showed that the expression of OsSnRK1A and AtSnRK1
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsSnRK1A and AtSnRK1.1 suppress protein translation to maintain energy homeostasis.
    + In the OsUbc13-RNAi plants, although the protein level of OsSnRK1a did not change, its activity and ABA sensitivity were obviously enhanced, and the K63-linked polyubiquitination was weaker than that of wild-type Dongjin (DJ)
    + Our data demonstrate OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of OsSnRK1a
