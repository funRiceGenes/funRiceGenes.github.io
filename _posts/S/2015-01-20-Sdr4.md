## Key message
1. __dormancy__, [Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We cloned a rice quantitative trait locus, Sdr4, which contributes substantially to differences in seed dormancy between japonica (Nipponbare) and indica (Kasalath) cultivars
2. __dormancy__, [Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program
