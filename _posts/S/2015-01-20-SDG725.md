## Key message
1. __seed__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds
2. __growth__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development
3. __erect__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds
4. __dwarf__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds
5. __brassinosteroid__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
6. __brassinosteroid__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that levels of H3K36me2/3 are reduced in chromatin at some regions of these brassinosteroid-related genes in SDG725 knockdown plants, and that SDG725 protein is able to directly bind to these target genes
7. __brassinosteroid__, [H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development

4. __MRG702__, __SDG725__, [MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Similar to the loss-of-function mutants of the rice H3K36 methyltransferase gene SDG725, the MRG702 knock-down mutants displayed typical BR-deficient mutant and late-flowering phenotypes
5. __MRG702__, __SDG725__, [MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Together, our results demonstrate that MRG702 acts as a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and deciphers the H3K36 methylation information set by SDG725
