* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, overexpression of STRK1 in rice not only improved growth at the seedling stage but also markedly limited the grain yield loss under salt stress conditions
    + The Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinase STRK1 Phosphorylates and Activates CatC, thereby Regulating H2O2 Homeostasis and Improving Salt Tolerance in Rice
    + Our findings demonstrate that STRK1 improves salt and oxidative tolerance by phosphorylating and activating CatC and thereby regulating H2O2 homeostasis
    + Our results show that STRK1 anchors and interacts with CatC at the plasma membrane via palmitoylation
