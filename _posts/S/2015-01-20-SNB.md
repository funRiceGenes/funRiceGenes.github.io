* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the floral organ development
    + SNB is expressed in all the examined tissues, but most strongly in the newly emerging spikelet meristems
    + In SNB knockout plants, the transition from spikelet meristems to floral meristems is delayed, resulting in the production of multiple rudimentary glumes in an alternative phyllotaxy
    + These phenotypes suggest that snb is a heterochronic mutant, affecting the phase transition of spikelet meristems, the pattern formation of floral organs and spikelet meristem determinancy
    + Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence architecture and the establishment of floral meristems
    + Two AP2 family genes, supernumerary bract (SNB) and Osindeterminate spikelet 1 (OsIDS1), synergistically control inflorescence architecture and floral meristem establishment in rice
    + We previously reported that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) regulates the transition of spikelet meristems into floral meristems in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + In snb osids1 double mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further delayed compared with the snb single mutant
    + Expression analyses showed that SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio-temporal expression of B- and E-function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules
