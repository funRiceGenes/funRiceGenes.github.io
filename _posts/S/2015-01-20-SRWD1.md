* **Key message**  
    + By analysis with microarray data, we found that a gene encoding a novel protein containing five WD40 repeats, was regulated by salt stress in rice and named as SRWD1 (Salt responsive WD40 protein 1)
    + Further, we found that SRWD1 was regulated with different patterns by salt stress in two rice cultivars responding differently to salt stress
