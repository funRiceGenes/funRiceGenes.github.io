## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [STRIPE2 encodes a putative dCMP deaminase that plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=STRIPE2 encodes a putative dCMP deaminase that plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Subcellular localization assay showed that the ST2 protein was located in mitochondria
2. __map-based cloning__, [STRIPE2 encodes a putative dCMP deaminase that plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=STRIPE2 encodes a putative dCMP deaminase that plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  The ST2 gene was finely confined to a 27-kb region on chromosome 1 by the map-based cloning strategy and a 5-bp deletion in Os01g0765000 was identified by sequence analysis
