* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Subcellular localization assay showed that the ST2 protein was located in mitochondria
    + The ST2 gene was finely confined to a 27-kb region on chromosome 1 by the map-based cloning strategy and a 5-bp deletion in Os01g0765000 was identified by sequence analysis
