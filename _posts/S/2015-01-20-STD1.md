* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, these results indicate that the MT-dependent ATPase activity is indispensible for STD1 in regulating normal cell division and organ development
    + In the std1 mutant, the substitution of Val-40-Glu in the motor domain of STD1 significantly reduced its MT-dependent ATPase activity
    + Map-based cloning revealed that STD1 encodes a phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related protein, a homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana PAKRP2, and is mainly expressed in the actively dividing tissues
