* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, these results indicate that the MT-dependent ATPase activity is indispensible for STD1 in regulating normal cell division and organ development
    + In the std1 mutant, the substitution of Val-40-Glu in the motor domain of STD1 significantly reduced its MT-dependent ATPase activity
    + Map-based cloning revealed that STD1 encodes a phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related protein, a homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana PAKRP2, and is mainly expressed in the actively dividing tissues

    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we found that STD1 interacted directly with MAP65-5, a member of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)
    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Both STD1 and MAP65-5 could form homodimers and bundle microtubules individually
    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with MAP65-5, the microtubules bundled by STD1 were disassembled completely into single microtubules after adding ATP
