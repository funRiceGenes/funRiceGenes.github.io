## Key message
1. __grain__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
2. __seed__, [A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length%5BTitle%5D), The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype srs3 in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the SRS3 gene
3. __seed__, [A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length%5BTitle%5D),  Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type
4. __seed__, [A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length%5BTitle%5D),  The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type
5. __seed__, [A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length%5BTitle%5D),  The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction
6. __cellulose__, [OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, our results suggest that OsKinesin-13A utilizes its microtubule depolymerization activity to promote microtubule turnover, which may not only influence transverse orientation of cortical microtubules but also facilitate vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and thus affects cellulose microfibril orientation and cell elongation
7. __cell elongation__, [OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.%5BTitle%5D), OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.
8. __cell elongation__, [OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, our results suggest that OsKinesin-13A utilizes its microtubule depolymerization activity to promote microtubule turnover, which may not only influence transverse orientation of cortical microtubules but also facilitate vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and thus affects cellulose microfibril orientation and cell elongation
