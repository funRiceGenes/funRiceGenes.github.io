## Key message
1. __blight__, [SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 AP1M1 and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 AP1M1 and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The spl28 mutant also exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight
2. __bacterial blight__, [SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 AP1M1 and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 AP1M1 and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The spl28 mutant also exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight
3. __blast__, [SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 AP1M1 and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 AP1M1 and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  The spl28 mutant also exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight
