* **Key message**  
    + Multiple experiments demonstrated that transcription factors NAC29/31 and MYB61 are CESA regulators in rice; NAC29/31 directly regulates MYB61, which in turn activates CESA expression
    + MYB61 is regulated by GRF4 and promotes nitrogen utilization and biomass production in rice
    + The indica allele of MYB61 displays robust transcription resulting in higher NUE and increased grain yield at reduced N supply than that of japonica
    + The variation at MYB61 has been selected during indica and japonica domestication
    + Here, via quantitative trait loci analysis and map-based cloning, we reveal that natural variation at the MYB61 locus leads to differences in N use and cellulose biogenesis between indica and japonica subspecies of rice
