* **Key message**  
    + Therefore, at the concentrations of free, non-aminoacylated tRNA prevailing within the cell (～0.1 μM), the tRNA binding ability of the EMAPII-like domain significantly improves the catalytic potency of plant MetRS.
    + Therefore, in the native enzymes, the EMAPII/Trbp-like domains of MetRSs are likely to be located near the acceptor stem of tRNA.
