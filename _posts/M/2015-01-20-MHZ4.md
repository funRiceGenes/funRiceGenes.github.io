    + Ethylene-Induced Inhibition of Root Growth Requires Abscisic Acid Function in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Seedlings
    + MHZ4 was identified through map-based cloning and encoded a chloroplast-localized membrane protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) ABA4, which is responsible for a branch of ABA biosynthesis.
    + MHZ4 mutation reduced ABA level, but promoted ethylene production. Ethylene induced MHZ4 expression and promoted ABA accumulation in roots.
    + MHZ4 overexpression resulted in enhanced and reduced ethylene response in roots and coleoptiles, respectively.
    + At mature stage, mhz4 mutation affects branching and adventitious root formation on stem nodes of higher positions, as well as yield-related traits.

Seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ethylene-Induced Inhibition of Root Growth Requires Abscisic Acid Function in Rice Oryza sativa L. Seedlings%5BTitle%5D), In coleoptile, MHZ4-dependent ABA pathway acts at or upstream of OsEIN2 to negatively regulate coleoptile ethylene response, possibly by affecting OsEIN2 expression.
