* **Key message**  
    + The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs
    + Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice
    + We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
    + MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect
    + MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes
    + Due to the increase in the number of floral organs and development of extra transformed palea/marginal region of the palea (mrp)-like organs, some mfs2 spikelets had a tendency to produce two florets
    + These defects implied that the mfs2 mutation caused abnormal specification of palea identity and partial loss of spikelet determination
    + The results indicate that MFS2 acts as a repressor that regulates floral organ identities and spikelet meristem determinacy in rice by forming a repression complex with rice TPL/TPR proteins
    + In the mfs2 mutant, specification of palea identity was severely disturbed and showed degradation or transformation into a lemma-like organ, and the number of all floral organs was increased to varying degrees
