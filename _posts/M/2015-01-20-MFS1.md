* **Key message**  
    + In addition, the sterile lemma was homeotically converted to the rudimentary glume and the body of the palea was degenerated in mfs1
    + Furthermore, our findings suggest that MFS1 positively regulates the expression of LONG STERILE LEMMA and the INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1)-like genes SUPERNUMERARY BRACT and OsIDS1
    + In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet mutant, multi-floret spikelet1 (mfs1), that showed delayed transformation of spikelet meristems to floral meristems, which resulted in an extra hull-like organ and an elongated rachilla
    + These results suggest that the MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 (MFS1) gene plays an important role in the regulation of spikelet meristem determinacy and floral organ identity
    + MFS1 messenger RNA is expressed in various tissues, especially in the spikelet and floral meristems
    + MFS1 belongs to an unknown function clade in the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family
