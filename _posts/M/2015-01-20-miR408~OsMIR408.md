* **Key message**  
    + As a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family in plants, miR408 is known to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, including drought
    + Interestingly, some studies indicated a species- and/or cultivar-specific drought-responsive characteristic of miR408 in plant drought stress
    + These findings implied that miR408 could serve as a potential target for genetic manipulations to engineer perennial grass plants for improved water stress tolerance
    + Analyses of gene expression patterns and functions indicated OsmiR408 is an embryo-specific miRNA that positively regulates grain size
