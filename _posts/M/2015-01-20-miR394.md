* **Key message**  
    + Rice miR394 suppresses leaf inclination through targeting an F-box gene, LEAF INCLINATION 4.
    + Here, we functionally characterize the role of rice miR394 and its target, LEAF INCLINCATION 4 (LC4), which encodes an F-box protein, in the regulation of leaf inclination
    + We show that miR394 and LC4 work, antagonistically, to regulate leaf lamina joint development and rice architecture, by modulating expansion and elongation of adaxial parenchyma cells
    + Rice plants with altered expression of miR394 or LC4 have altered auxin responses, indicating that the miR394-LC4 module mediates auxin effects important for determining rice leaf inclination and architecture
    + LC4 interacts with SKP1, a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and transcription of both miR394 and LC4 are regulated by auxin
