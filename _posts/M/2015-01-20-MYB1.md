* **Key message**  
    + MYB1 was transcriptionally induced in leaf sheaths and old leaf blades
    + Furthermore, MYB1 affected the elongation of the primary root in a Pi-dependent manner and lateral roots in a Pi-independent manner
    + Moreover, gibberellic acid (GA)-triggered lateral root elongation was largely suppressed in wild-type plants under Pi starvation conditions, whereas this suppression was partially rescued in myb1 mutant lines, correlating with the up-regulation of a GA biosynthetic gene upon MYB1 mutation
    + Taken together, the findings of this study highlight the role of MYB1 as a regulator involved in both Pi starvation signaling and GA biosynthesis
    + Mutation of MYB1 led to an increase in Pi uptake and accumulation, accompanied by altered expression of a subset of Pi transporters and several genes involved in Pi starvation signaling
