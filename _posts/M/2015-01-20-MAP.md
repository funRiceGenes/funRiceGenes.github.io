## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM/FAS1 FASCIATA1), GTE4 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4 and MAP MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN were identified
2. __shoot__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM/FAS1 FASCIATA1), GTE4 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4 and MAP MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN were identified
3. __auxin__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM/FAS1 FASCIATA1), GTE4 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4 and MAP MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN were identified
4. __auxin__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
5. __transcription factor__, [Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM/FAS1 FASCIATA1), GTE4 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4 and MAP MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN were identified
