* **Key message**  
    + We found that mutations in one MIR156 subfamily enhance seed dormancy and suppress PHS with negligible effects on shoot architecture and grain size, whereas mutations in another MIR156 subfamily modify shoot architecture and increase grain size but have minimal effects on seed dormancy
    + The grain yield modulator miR156 regulates seed dormancy through the gibberellin pathway in rice.
    + Mechanistically, mir156 mutations enhance seed dormancy by suppressing the gibberellin (GA) pathway through de-represssion of the miR156 target gene Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), which directly regulates multiple genes in the GA pathway
    + miR156 is a conserved miRNA, and most previous studies focus on its roles in plant growth, development, and yield determinacy
