* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth
    + MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin
    + These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth
    + Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth
    + MAIF1 expression is induced rapidly and strongly by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses
