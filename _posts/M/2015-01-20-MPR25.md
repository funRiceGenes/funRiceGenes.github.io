## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we investigated the molecular function in rice of the mitochondrial PPR-encoding gene MITOCHONDRIAL PPR25 (MPR25), which belongs to the E subgroup of the PPR family
2. __mitochondria__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts
3. __mitochondria__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C-U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria
4. __mitochondria__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts
5. __mitochondria__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D), Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria
6. __chloroplast__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts
7. __chloroplast__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts
8. __growth__, [Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria%5BTitle%5D),  A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale-green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development
9. __chloroplast__, [AEF1/MPR25 is implicated in RNA editing of plastid atpF and mitochondrial nad5 and also promotes atpF splicing in Arabidopsis and rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(AEF1/MPR25 is implicated in RNA editing of plastid atpF and mitochondrial nad5 and also promotes atpF splicing in Arabidopsis and rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We also show that splicing of chloroplast atpF transcripts is affected in the rice mpr25 mutant
