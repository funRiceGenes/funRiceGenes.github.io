* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we investigated the molecular function in rice of the mitochondrial PPR-encoding gene MITOCHONDRIAL PPR25 (MPR25), which belongs to the E subgroup of the PPR family
    + FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts
    + Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C-U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria
    + The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts
    + Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria
    + A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale-green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development
    + We also show that splicing of chloroplast atpF transcripts is affected in the rice mpr25 mutant
