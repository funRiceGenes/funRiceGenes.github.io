* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here, through an analysis of a rice ethylene-response mutant mhz1, we show that MHZ1 positively modulates root ethylene responses
    + MHZ1 encodes the rice histidine kinase OsHK1

    + __ERS2__, __MHZ1~OsHK1~HK1__, [Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D), Ethylene receptor OsERS2, via its GAF domain, physically interacts with MHZ1/OsHK1 and inhibits its kinase activity.
    + __MHZ1~OsHK1~HK1__, __OsEIN2__, [Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D), Genetic analyses suggest that MHZ1/OsHK1 acts at the level of ethylene perception and works together with the OsEIN2-mediated pathway to regulate root growth.
    + __MHZ1~OsHK1~HK1__, __OsRR21__, [Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.%5BTitle%5D), MHZ1/OsHK1 is autophosphorylated at a conserved histidine residue and can transfer the phosphoryl signal to the response regulator OsRR21 via the phosphotransfer proteins OsAHP1/2.
