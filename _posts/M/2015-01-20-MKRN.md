* **Key message**  
    + We isolated RNA from embryonic axes of rice seeds at various stages of imbibition and germination and studied the temporal expression profile of MKRN by RT-PCR
    + The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice
    + This analysis revealed that MKRN transcripts were expressed in young plumules, lateral root primordia, leaf primordia, leaves and root tissues at many different stages of germination
    + After 6days of germination, an organ-dependent expression pattern of MKRN was observed: highest in roots and moderate in leaves
