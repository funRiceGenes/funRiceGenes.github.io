* **Key message**  
    + Under normal growth conditions, altered expression of miR2105 and OsbZIP86 displayed no substantial effect on rice growth
    + miR2105 and the kinase OsSAPK10 co-regulate OsbZIP86 to mediate drought-induced ABA biosynthesis in rice.
    + However, under drought conditions, miR2105 knockdown or OsbZIP86 overexpression transgenic rice plants showed higher ABA content, enhanced tolerance to drought, lower rates of water loss, and more stomatal closure of seedlings, compared with wild-type rice Zhonghua 11; in contrast, miR2105 overexpression, OsbZIP86 downregulation, and OsbZIP86 knockout plants displayed opposite phenotypes
