* **Key message**  
    + Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
    + We characterized a rice monoculm mutant moc2, which showed significantly reduced tiller numbers, pale-green leaves, a reduced growth rate, and a consequent dwarf phenotype.
    + Inconsistent change was observed in the expression of genes involved in tiller bud outgrowth, suggesting that the moc2 mutant has a defective function necessary for the tiller bud outgrowth.
    + The monoculm phenotype of the moc2 mutant supports the idea that sucrose supply may be an important cue to outgrow tiller buds.
