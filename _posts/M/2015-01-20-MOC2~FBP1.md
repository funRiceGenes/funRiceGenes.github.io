2. __tiller number__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
3. __dwarf__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), We characterized a rice monoculm mutant moc2, which showed significantly reduced tiller numbers, pale-green leaves, a reduced growth rate, and a consequent dwarf phenotype. 
4. __growth rate__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), We characterized a rice monoculm mutant moc2, which showed significantly reduced tiller numbers, pale-green leaves, a reduced growth rate, and a consequent dwarf phenotype. 
5. __growth__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), We characterized a rice monoculm mutant moc2, which showed significantly reduced tiller numbers, pale-green leaves, a reduced growth rate, and a consequent dwarf phenotype. 
6. __leaf__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), We characterized a rice monoculm mutant moc2, which showed significantly reduced tiller numbers, pale-green leaves, a reduced growth rate, and a consequent dwarf phenotype. 
7. __tiller bud outgrowth__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), Inconsistent change was observed in the expression of genes involved in tiller bud outgrowth, suggesting that the moc2 mutant has a defective function necessary for the tiller bud outgrowth.
8. __sucrose__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), The monoculm phenotype of the moc2 mutant supports the idea that sucrose supply may be an important cue to outgrow tiller buds.
9. __sucrose supply__, [Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice monoculm mutation moc2, which inhibits outgrowth of the second tillers, is ascribed to lack of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase%5BTitle%5D), The monoculm phenotype of the moc2 mutant supports the idea that sucrose supply may be an important cue to outgrow tiller buds.
