* **Key message**  
    + MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.
    + Here we show that miR390 induced by auxin promotes lateral root growth in rice
    + MiR390 was found to be dominantly expressed at lateral root primordia and roots tips while miR393 mainly expressed in the base part of roots at very low level
    + We propose that miR390 induced by auxin triggers the lateral root growth under normal growth conditions, meanwhile miR393 just lurks as a potentially regulative role; Once plants suffer from stresses, miR393 will be induced to negatively regulate miR390-mediated growth of lateral roots in rice
    + However, the risen expression level of miR390 induced by auxin didn't affect the expression of miR393 and its target OsTIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1)
