* **Information**  
    + Symbol: MHZ3

* **Publication**  
    + [Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.

* **Key message**  
    + The association of MHZ3 with the Nramp-like domain is crucial for OsEIN2 accumulation, demonstrating the significance of the OsEIN2 transmembrane domains in ethylene signaling
    + Together, these results suggest that ethylene-induced MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 likely by binding to its Nramp-like domain and impeding protein ubiquitination to facilitate ethylene signal transduction
