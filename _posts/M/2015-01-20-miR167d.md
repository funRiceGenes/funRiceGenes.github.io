* **Publication**  
    + [miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2022, Rice (N Y).

* **Key message**  
    + These findings indicate that the appropriate expression of miR167d is crucial and the miR167d-ARFs module plays important roles in the regulation of flower opening and stigma size in rice
    + Blocking miR167d by target mimicry also led to a morphological alteration of the individual floral organs, including a reduction in stigma size and alteration of lodicule cell morphology, but did not show the cleistogamous phenotype
    + The overexpression of miR167d (OX167d) resulted in failed elongation of stamen filaments, increased stigma size, and morphological alteration of lodicule, resulting in cleistogamy
