* **Key message**  
    + MID1 was primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues, with low level in the tapetum, and was induced by drought and other abiotic stresses
    + Our findings suggest that MID1 is a transcriptional regulator that promotes rice male development under drought by modulating the expressions of drought-related and anther developmental genes and provide valuable information for crop improvement
    + MID1 Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development.
    + We show here that MID1 (MYB Important for Drought Response1), encoding a putative R-R-type MYB-like transcription factor, can improve rice yield under drought
    + MID1 was localized to the nucleus and could activate gene expression in yeast, and its homologs were identified in many other plants with high levels sequence similarity
