## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MYBS3 is a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor previously shown to mediate sugar signaling in rice
2. __seed__, [Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Three Novel MYB Proteins with One DNA Binding Repeat Mediate Sugar and Hormone Regulation of alpha-Amylase Gene Expression%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
3. __yield__, [A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing MYBS3 tolerated 4 degrees C for at least 1 week and exhibited no yield penalty in normal field conditions
4. __cold tolerance__, [A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicated that MYBS3 was sufficient and necessary for enhancing cold tolerance in rice
5. __cold tolerance__, [A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice
6. __abiotic stress__, [A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Several genes activated by MYBS3 as well as inducible by cold have previously been implicated in various abiotic stress responses and/or tolerance in rice and other plant species
7. __cold stress__, [A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " DREB1 responded quickly and transiently while MYBS3 responded slowly to cold stress, which suggests that distinct pathways act sequentially and complementarily for adapting short- and long-term cold stress in rice"

5. __MYBS3~OsMYBS3__, __OsMKK1__, [The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
