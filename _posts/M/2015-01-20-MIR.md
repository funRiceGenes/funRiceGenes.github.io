* **Key message**  
    + Growth in the MIR T-DNA knockout rice mutant (mir) was significantly impaired compared to wild-type (WT) plants when grown under Fe-deficient or -sufficient conditions
    + We cloned and characterized a mitochondrial iron-regulated (MIR) gene in rice involved in Fe homeostasis
    + Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene (MIR) plays an important role in iron homeostasis
    + MIR, when expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells, was localized to the mitochondria
    + These results clearly suggest that MIR is a rice-specific mitochondrial protein, recently evolved, and plays a significant role in Fe homeostasis
    + MIR transcripts were greatly increased in response to Fe deficiency in roots and shoot tissue
    + Furthermore, mir plants accumulated more than twice the amount of Fe in shoot and root tissue compared to WT plants when grown under either Fe-sufficient or -deficient conditions
    + Despite the high accumulation of Fe in roots and shoots, mir plants triggered the expression of Fe-deficiency-inducible genes, indicating that mir may not be able to utilize Fe for physiological functions
