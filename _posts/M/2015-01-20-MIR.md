## Key message
1. __growth__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  Growth in the MIR T-DNA knockout rice mutant mir was significantly impaired compared to wild-type WT plants when grown under Fe-deficient or -sufficient conditions
2. __iron__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  We cloned and characterized a mitochondrial iron-regulated MIR gene in rice involved in Fe homeostasis
3. __iron__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D), Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis
4. __mitochondria__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  We cloned and characterized a mitochondrial iron-regulated MIR gene in rice involved in Fe homeostasis
5. __mitochondria__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  MIR, when expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells, was localized to the mitochondria
6. __mitochondria__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  These results clearly suggest that MIR is a rice-specific mitochondrial protein, recently evolved, and plays a significant role in Fe homeostasis
7. __mitochondria__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D), Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis
8. __root__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  MIR transcripts were greatly increased in response to Fe deficiency in roots and shoot tissue
9. __root__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, mir plants accumulated more than twice the amount of Fe in shoot and root tissue compared to WT plants when grown under either Fe-sufficient or -deficient conditions
10. __root__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  Despite the high accumulation of Fe in roots and shoots, mir plants triggered the expression of Fe-deficiency-inducible genes, indicating that mir may not be able to utilize Fe for physiological functions
11. __homeostasis__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  We cloned and characterized a mitochondrial iron-regulated MIR gene in rice involved in Fe homeostasis
12. __homeostasis__, [Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene MIR plays an important role in iron homeostasis%5BTitle%5D),  These results clearly suggest that MIR is a rice-specific mitochondrial protein, recently evolved, and plays a significant role in Fe homeostasis
