* **Information**  
    + Symbol: miR444  
    + MSU: None

* **Publication**  
    + [Nitrate-dependent regulation of miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade controls root development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Nitrate-dependent regulation of miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade controls root development in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2021, J Exp Bot.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants expressing miR444 target mimic improved rice root growth
    + Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified OsMADS27 as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth
