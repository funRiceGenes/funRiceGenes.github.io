* **Information**  
    + Symbol: miR162b  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: [Os04g0488650](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0488650)  

* **Publication**  
    + [Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, J Genet Genomics.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1
