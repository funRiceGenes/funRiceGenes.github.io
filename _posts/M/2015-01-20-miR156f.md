* **Information**  
    + Symbol: miR156f  
    + MSU: None

* **Publication**  
    + [Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, J Exp Bot.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + In contrast, plants over-expression a miR156f target mimic (MIM156fOE) had a reduced tiller number and increased height
    + Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture
