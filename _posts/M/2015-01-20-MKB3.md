* **Key message**  
    + Expression analysis revealed thatMKB3is predominantly expressed on the epidermis of leaf primordia, which is different from the case ofAN3A protein movement assay demonstrated that MKB3 moves from anMKB3-expressing domain to a non-expressing domain, which is required for normal leaf development
