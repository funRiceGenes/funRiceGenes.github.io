* **Key message**  
    + Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in moc3
    + The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs
    + Homeobox Is Pivotal for OsWUS Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.
    + OsWUS has recently been shown to be a transcription factor gene critical for tiller development and fertility in rice
    + Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by a mutation in OsWUS Compared with the two previously reported null allelic mutants of OsWUS (tab1-1 and moc3-1), which could produce partial N-terminal peptides of OsWUS, the srt1 protein contained a deletion of only seven amino acids within the conserved homeobox domain of OsWUS
    + Recently, we showed that a double mutant of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1) led to a marked enlargement of the inflorescence meristem, and that the TAB1 function is not associated with massive stem cells in this meristem
    + In addition, misexpression of TAB1 under the promoter of FON1 led to a slight reduction of the SAM size in wild type, suggesting that TAB1 is not a positive regulator of stem cells
    + In this paper, we confirmed that TAB1 is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the fon2 and fon2 asp1 mutants
    + Taking together, TAB1 seems not to be involved in meristem maintenance, irrespective of the meristem type
    + We revealed that stem cells were established at an early stage of axillary meristem development in wild type, but were not maintained in tab1
    + By contrast, the stem cell region and TAB1 expression domain were expanded in fon2, and FON2 overexpression inhibited axillary meristem formation
    + These results indicate that TAB1 is required to maintain stem cells during axillary meristem development, whereas FON2 negatively regulates stem cell fate by restricting TAB1 expression
    + OsWUS promotes tiller bud growth by establishing weak apical dominance in rice
    + Auxin response is enhanced in the dc1 mutant, and knocking out the auxin action-associated gene ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE 1 (ASP1) de-repressed growth of the tiller buds in the dc1 mutant, suggesting that OsWUS and ASP1 are both involved in outgrowth of the rice tiller bud
    + Collectively, these findings reveal an important role of OsWUS in tiller bud growth by influencing apical dominance, and provide the basis for an improved understanding of tiller bud development in rice
    + In this study, we identified and functionally characterized a low-tillering mutant decreased culm number 1 (dc1) that resulted from loss-of-function of OsWUS
