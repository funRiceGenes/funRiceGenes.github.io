* **Key message**  
    + STD1 specifically interacts with MAP65-5 in rice and they cooperatively control microtubule bundles in phragmoplast expansion during cell division

    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we found that STD1 interacted directly with MAP65-5, a member of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)
    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Both STD1 and MAP65-5 could form homodimers and bundle microtubules individually
    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with MAP65-5, the microtubules bundled by STD1 were disassembled completely into single microtubules after adding ATP
    + __MAP65-5__, __STD1__, [Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.%5BTitle%5D),  Conversely, the interaction of STD1 with MAP65-5 enhanced the microtubule bundling
