* **Key message**  
    + The reduced root meristem activity of aim1 results from reduced salicylic acid (SA) levels and can be rescued by SA application
    + Like SA, ROS application substantially increased root length and root meristem activity in aim1
    + These results suggest that AIM1 is required for root growth in rice due to its critical role in SA biosynthesis: SA maintains root meristem activity through promoting ROS accumulation by inducing the activity of WRKY transcriptional repressors, which repress the expression of redox and ROS-scavenging genes
