    + Symbol: miR408  
    + MSU: None

* **Publication**  
    + [Overexpression of Os-microRNA408 enhances drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of Os-microRNA408 enhances drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass%5BTitle%5D), 2020, Physiol Plant.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + As a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family in plants, miR408 is known to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, including drought
    + Interestingly, some studies indicated a species- and/or cultivar-specific drought-responsive characteristic of miR408 in plant drought stress
    + These findings implied that miR408 could serve as a potential target for genetic manipulations to engineer perennial grass plants for improved water stress tolerance
