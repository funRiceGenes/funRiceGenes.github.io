    + __xa21__, __Xb3__, [Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance%5BTitle%5D), The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays
