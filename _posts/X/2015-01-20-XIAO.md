* **Key message**  
    + Here we identified a rice T-DNA insertion mutant for organ size, referred to as xiao, that displays dwarfism and erect leaves, typical BR-related phenotypes, together with reduced seed setting
    + The small stature of the xiao mutant resulted from reduced organ sizes due to decreased cell numbers resulting from reduced cell division rate, as supported by the observed co-expression of XIAO with a number of genes involved in cell cycling
    + XIAO is involved in the control of organ size by contributing to the regulation of signaling and homeostasis of brassinosteroids and cell cycling in rice
    + The xiao mutant displayed a tissue-specific enhanced BR response and greatly reduced BR contents at the whole-plant level
    + These results indicated that XIAO is a regulator of BR signaling and cell division
    + Thus, XIAO may provide a possible connection between BRs and cell-cycle regulation in controlling organ growth
