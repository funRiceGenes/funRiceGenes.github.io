* **Key message**  
    + Multiple gene loci affecting genetic background-controlled disease resistance conferred by R gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice
    + The function of bacterial-blight resistance gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice is influenced by genetic background; the Oryza sativa L
    + Xa3 is genetically tightly linked to Xa26, another gene for bacterial blight resistance
    + Xa3, conferring resistance for rice bacterial blight and encoding a receptor kinase-like protein, is the same as Xa26
    + The Xa26( t) locus is tightly linked to another bacterial blight resistance gene locus, Xa4
    + Sequence analysis revealed that IRBB3 and Zhachanglong lines that are resistant to a broad range of Xoo strains, also carry Xa26
    + BACKGROUND: Rice Xa3/Xa26 disease-resistance gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein against Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap
    + The expression pattern of a rice disease resistance gene xa3/xa26 is differentially regulated by the genetic backgrounds and developmental stages that influence its function
    + Some F(2) individuals showed significantly increased Xa3/Xa26 transcripts, but the increased transcripts did not completely correlate with the reduced disease in this population
    + Xa3-mediated resistance for rice bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, is influenced by genetic background
    + The rice disease resistance (R) gene Xa3/Xa26 (having also been named Xa3 and Xa26) against Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Xa3/Xa26-2 and Xa3/Xa26-3 conferred resistance to 16 of the 18 Xoo strains examined
    + Transgenic plants carrying a single copy of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, or Xa3/Xa26-3, in the same genetic background, showed a similar resistance spectrum to a set of Xoo strains, although plants carrying Xa3/Xa26-2 or Xa3/Xa26-3 showed lower resistance levels than the plants carrying Xa3/Xa26
    + Phenotypic comparison showed that all the rice lines carrying either Xa3 or Xa26 developed dark brown deposition at the border between the lesion caused by incompatible-pathogen infection and health leaf tissue, while other rice lines did not show this dark brown deposition in either incompatible or compatible interactions
    + Xa3 expression gradually increases from early seedling stage to adult stage
    + A rice gene, Xa26, conferring resistance against Xoo at both seedling and adult stages was isolated by map-based cloning strategies from the rice cultivar Minghui 63
    + A new dominant gene against a Chinese Xoo strain JL691 in both the seedling and adult stages was identified in Minghui 63 and designated as Xa26( t)
    + , further reduced lesion length), and whole-growth-stage resistance compared to the indica rice; this enhanced resistance was associated with an increased expression of Xa3 throughout the growth stages in the japonica plants, which resulted in enhanced expression of defense-responsive genes
    + Moreover, transgenic plants carrying Xa26 showed enhanced resistance compared with the donor line of the gene in both seedling and adult stages
