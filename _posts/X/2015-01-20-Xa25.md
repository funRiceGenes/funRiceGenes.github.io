## Expression information

## Key message
1. __resistant__, [A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339
2. __blight__, [New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line%5BTitle%5D),  A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China
3. __growth__, [A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
4. __bacterial blight__, [New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line%5BTitle%5D),  A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China
5. __seedling__, [A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
6. __ xoo __, [A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance
7. __ xoo __, [A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
8. __ xoo __, [A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections
