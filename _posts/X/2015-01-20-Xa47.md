* **Key message**  
    + A new NLR disease resistance gene Xa47 confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.
    + By contrast, overexpression of Xa47 in the susceptible rice material JG30 increased BB resistance
    + Consequently, Xa47 may have application potential in the genetic improvement of plant disease resistance
    + The findings indicate that Xa47 positively regulates the Xoo stress response
    + In this study, Xa47, a new bacterial blight R gene encoding a typical NLR, was isolated from G252 rice material, and XA47 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm
    + Compared with the wild-type G252, the knockout mutants of Xa47 was more susceptible to Xoo
