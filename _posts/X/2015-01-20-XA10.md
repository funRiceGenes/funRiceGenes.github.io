* **Key message**  
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Xa10, a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector-dependent R gene for resistance to bacterial blight in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Expression of Xa10 induces programmed cell death in rice, Nicotiana benthamiana, and mammalian HeLa cells
    + XA10 variants that abolish programmed cell death and ER Ca(2+) depletion in N
    + We propose that XA10 is an inducible, intrinsic terminator protein that triggers programmed cell death by a conserved mechanism involving disruption of the ER and cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis
    + The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum
    + The rice TAL effector-dependent disease resistance gene Xa10 confers narrow-spectrum race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Genetic engineering of the Xa10 promoter for broad-spectrum and durable resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + To generate broad-spectrum and durable resistance to Xoo, we developed a modified Xa10 gene, designated as Xa10(E5)
    + The rice disease resistance (R) genes Xa10 confers race-specific disease resistance to X
    + Xa10 encodes an executor R protein that triggers hypersensitive response and activates disease resistance
    + Transgenic rice plants containing Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni under the Xa10 promoter provided specific disease resistance to X
    + The 19-amino acid residues at the N-terminal regions of XA10 or XA10-Ni are dispensable for their function in inducing cell death in N
