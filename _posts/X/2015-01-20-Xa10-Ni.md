* **Key message**  
    + Like XA10, both XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, show self-interaction and induce ER Ca2+ depletion in leaf cells of N
    + Here we designated the two Xa10-like genes as Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni and characterized their function for disease resistance to rice bacterial blight
    + Both Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni provided disease resistance to X
    + Transgenic rice plants containing Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni under the Xa10 promoter provided specific disease resistance to X
    + Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni knock-out mutants abolished dTALE-dependent disease resistance to X
    + The results indicate that Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nipponbare encode functional executor R proteins, which induce cell death in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and have potential of being engineered to provide broad-spectrum disease resistance to plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species
    + Heterologous expression of Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nicotiana benthamiana triggered cell death
    + The 19-amino acid residues at the N-terminal regions of XA10 or XA10-Ni are dispensable for their function in inducing cell death in N
