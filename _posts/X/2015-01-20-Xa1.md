## Expression information

## Key message
1. __bacterial blight__, [Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation%5BTitle%5D), Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
2. __blight__, [Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation%5BTitle%5D), Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
3. __disease__, [Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation%5BTitle%5D),  The deduced amino acid sequence of the Xa1 gene product contains nucleotide binding sites NBS and a new type of leucine-rich repeats LRR; thus, Xa1 is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease-resistance genes, but quite different from Xa21, another BB-resistance gene isolated from rice
