* **Key message**  
    + Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation
    + The deduced amino acid sequence of the Xa1 gene product contains nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and a new type of leucine-rich repeats (LRR); thus, Xa1 is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease-resistance genes, but quite different from Xa21, another BB-resistance gene isolated from rice
    + However, the iTALEs present in many isolates interfere with the otherwise broad-spectrum resistance conferred by Xa1
    + Although Xa1-2 and Xa14 conferred different resistance spectra, their performance could be attenuated by iTALEs, as has previously been reported for Xa1
    + Here, we report the isolation of three new bacterial blight R genes in rice, Xa1-2, Xa14, and Xa31(t), which were allelic to Xa1 and encoded atypical NLRs with unique central tandem repeats (CTRs)
    + Xa1 Allelic R Genes Activate Rice Blight Resistance Suppressed by Interfering TAL Effectors
    + One mechanism involves the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) resistance gene Xa1 and TALEs
    + Reciprocally, Xoo has evolved TALE variants, C-terminally truncated versions (interfering TALEs or iTALEs), to overcome Xa1 resistance
    + On the other hand, iTALEs could suppress the resistance mediated by Xa1 allelic R genes, and iTALE genes were prevalent (бл95%) in Asian, but not in African Xoo strains
    + Our findings demonstrate the prominence of a defense mechanism in which rice depends on Xa1 alleles and a counteracting mechanism in which Xoo relies on iTALEs for BB
