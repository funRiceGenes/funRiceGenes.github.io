* **Key message**  
    + Silencing of the SDF2 genes in the XA21 rice genetic background compromises resistance to Xoo but does not affect plant growth and development
    + Interestingly, most signaling and transcriptional regulator genes were downregulated at 4 and 8 hpi, suggesting that negative regulation of cellular signaling may play a role in the Xa21-mediated defense response
    + Comparison of expression profiles between Xa21- and other R gene-mediated defense systems revealed interesting common responses
    + Transcriptional characteristics of Xa21-mediated defense responses in rice
    + The rice pattern recognition receptor (PRR) XA21 confers race-specific resistance in leaf infection by bacterial blight Xathomonas oryzae pv
    + Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance
    + Few components involved in transducing the Xa21-mediated defense response have yet been identified
    + 1 are compromised in basal defense and Xa21-mediated resistance to Xoo
    + OsWRKY62 is a negative regulator of basal and Xa21-mediated defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice
    + The transgenic plants constitutively expressing the wild-type XA21 or its GFP fusion displayed race-specific resistance to Xoo at the adult and seedling stages
    + We also established a root infection system and demonstrated that XA21 also mediated race-specific resistance responses to Xoo in the root
    + Here we report that Xa21 is induced by Xoo infection and that ectopic expression of Xa21 confers resistance at three leaf stage (three-week-old), overcoming the developmental limitation of XA21-mediated resistance
    + Characterization of Xa21 should facilitate understanding of plant disease resistance and lead to engineered resistance in rice
    + A receptor kinase-like protein encoded by the rice disease resistance gene, Xa21
    + Genetic and physical analysis of the rice bacterial blight disease resistance locus, Xa21
    + Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, xa13, and Xa21) and gene pyramids
    + Here, we report that XA21 binds to a WRKY transcription factor, called OsWRKY62
    + The molecular genetic mechanism controlling the integration of the Xa21-mediated disease resistance response with the developmental program in rice is under study in this model system
    + Expression of the Xa21 gene transcript is not correlated with expression of Xa21 disease resistance indicating that the developmental regulation of Xa21-resistance is either controlled post-transcriptionally or by other factors
    + Short communication: developmental control of Xa21-mediated disease resistance in rice
    + XA21 is a receptor-like kinase protein in rice (Oryza sativa) that confers gene-for-gene resistance to specific races of the causal agent of bacterial blight disease, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae
    + The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage
    + Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance
    + The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance
    + Ectopic expression of Xa21 also up-regulates a larger set of defense-related genes as compared to Xa21 driven by the native promoter
    + These results indicate that altered regulation of Xa21 expression is useful for developing enhanced resistance to Xoo at multiple developmental stages
    + The cloned rice gene Xa21 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Xoo races
    + Our current study provides an insight into the nature of the XA21-mediated resistance and a practical approach using the root cell system to further dissect the cellular signaling of the PRR during the rice-Xoo interaction
    + Xa21-resistance progressively increases from the susceptible juvenile leaf 2 stage through later stages, with 100% resistance at the adult leaf 9/10 stage
    + The rice disease resistance gene, Xa21, encodes a receptor kinase-like protein consisting of leucine-rich repeats in the putative extracellular domain and a serine/threonine kinase in the putative intracellular domain
    + Finally, our data suggest that the region of XA21 kinase corresponding to the RD kinase activation domain is not phosphorylated, revealing a distinct mode of action compared with the tomato Pto serine/threonine kinase conferring disease resistance
    + Biochemical characterization of the kinase domain of the rice disease resistance receptor-like kinase XA21
    + We identified 192 proteins in DRMs that included receptor-like kinases (RLKs) such as Xa21, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)-type disease resistance proteins, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, syntaxin, NADPH oxidase, a WD-40 repeat family protein and various GTP-binding proteins
    + Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance
    + Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity
    + The Xa21 gene confers a broad and persistent resistance against BB
    + These results suggested that Xa21 primed critically important genes and signaling pathways, enhancing its resistance against bacterial infection
    + Rice Xa21 primed genes and pathways that are critical for combating bacterial blight infection.
    + The rice XA21 receptor kinase confers robust resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaepv
    + From this analysis, we identified eight genes that are up-regulated in both in elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP rice leaves and Xoo infected XA21 rice leaves
    + Mutation of the rice XA21 predicted nuclear localization sequence does not affect resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + The rice receptor kinase XA21 confers robust resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaepv
    + We previously reported that XA21 is cleaved in transgenic plants overexpressing XA21 with a GFP tag (Ubi-XA21-GFP) and that the released C-terminal domain is localized to the nucleus
    + XA21 carries a predicted nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that directs the C-terminal domain to the nucleus in transient assays, whereas alanine substitutions in the NLS disrupt the nuclear localization
    + To determine if the predicted NLS is required for XA21-mediated immunity in planta, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing an XA21 variant carrying the NLS with the same alanine substitutions (Ubi-XA21nls-GFP)
    + The rice immune receptor XA21 is activated by the sulfated microbial peptide required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity X (RaxX) produced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Here we demonstrate that the rice immune sensor XA21 promotes survival of rice seedlings during dehydration stress
    + XA21 expression increases deposition of lignin and cellulose in the xylem vessels and their surrounding cells
    + Inhibition of aquaporin water channels by mercuric chloride eliminates XA21-mediated dehydration survival, suggesting that XA21 enables plant survival during drought, probably by protecting xylem functionality
    + Rice immune sensor XA21 differentially enhances plant growth and survival under distinct levels of drought
    + In contrast to prevailing observations of stress tolerance genes, XA21 is also capable of enhancing rice growth during moderate drought
    + Thus, XA21 acts as a mediator for stress protection and plant growth under water-limiting conditions
