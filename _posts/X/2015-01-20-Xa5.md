* **Key message**  
    + The recessive gene xa5 confers resistance to bacterial blight in rice
    + Further, one allele of Xa5 is sufficient to promote disease in previously resistant plants; additional copies are not predictive of increased lesion length
    + The recessive gene xa5 for resistance to bacterial blight resistance of rice is located on chromosome 5, and evidence based on genetic recombination has been shown to encode a small subunit of the basal transcription factor IIA (Iyer and McCouch in MPMI 17(12):1348-1354, 2004)
    + The structural analysis indicates that xa5 and Xa5 potentially retain their basic transcription factor function, which, in turn, may mediate the novel pathway for bacterial blight resistance and susceptibility, respectively
    + Testifying the rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa5 by genetic complementation and further analyzing xa5 (Xa5) in comparison with its homolog TFIIAgamma1
    + Genetic and functional characterization of the rice bacterial blight disease resistance gene xa5
    + How xa5 functions in bacterial blight resistance is not well understood, and its recessive gene action is disputed
    + The xa5 resistance gene from rice provides recessive, race-specific resistance to bacterial blight of rice caused by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae
    + High resolution genetic mapping and candidate gene identification at the xa5 locus for bacterial blight resistance in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)
    + An xa5 Resistance Gene-Breaking Indian Strain of the Rice Bacterial Blight Pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Is Nearly Identical to a Thai Strain
