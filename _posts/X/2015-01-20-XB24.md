* **Key message**  
    + Rice lines silenced for Xb24 display enhanced XA21-mediated immunity, whereas rice lines overexpressing XB24 are compromised for immunity.
    + Silencing of Xb24 Enhances Xa21-Mediated Resistance.
    + Our initial results indicated that silencing of Xb24 enhanced resistance
    + These results demonstrate that silencing of Xb24 expression enhances XA21-mediated disease resistance.
    + Thus, we conclude that the ATPase activity of XB24 is essential for XB24 to regulate XA21-mediated defense response.
