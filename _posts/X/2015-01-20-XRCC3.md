    + [KM983395](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KM983395)

* **Key message**  
    + The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
    + Taken together, the results suggest that XRCC3 plays critical roles in both DSB repair and homologous chromosome recombination during rice meiosis
