* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
    + Taken together, the results suggest that XRCC3 plays critical roles in both DSB repair and homologous chromosome recombination during rice meiosis
