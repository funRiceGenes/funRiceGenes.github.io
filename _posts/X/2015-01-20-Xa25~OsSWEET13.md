* **Key message**  
    + Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339
    + A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25(t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China
    + The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth
    + Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance
    + The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections
    + Natural variations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14 expand the range of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
    + In this study, we identified candidate resistance alleles by mining a rice diversity panel for mutations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14, which are direct targets of three major TALEs PthXo2, PthXo3 and AvrXa7
    + Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression
    + Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses
    + Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice
    + Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of <a6><c2>-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses
