## Publication
1. [A receptor like kinase gene with expressional responsiveness on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is essential for Xa21-mediated disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A receptor like kinase gene with expressional responsiveness on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is essential for Xa21-mediated disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Rice (N Y).

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__:Here we report the identification of one LRR-RLK gene (XIK1) whose expression is induced rapidly upon the infection with the pathogen of Xoo |  Expression pattern analysis reveals that XIK1 is preferentially expressed in reproductive leaves and panicles, and that expression is associated with plant development |  By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of XIK1 in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of XIK1 compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21 |  In addition, we found that the expression of the downstream marker genes of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) in rice was compromised in Xa21 plants silenced for XIK1  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of XIK1 in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of XIK1 compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21
