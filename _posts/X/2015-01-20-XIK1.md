* **Key message**  
    + By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of XIK1 in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of XIK1 compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21
    + Our study reveals that the LRR-RLK gene XIK1 is Xoo-responsive and positively regulates Xa21-mediated disease resistance
    + Expression pattern analysis reveals that XIK1 is preferentially expressed in reproductive leaves and panicles, and that expression is associated with plant development
    + In addition, we found that the expression of the downstream marker genes of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) in rice was compromised in Xa21 plants silenced for XIK1
